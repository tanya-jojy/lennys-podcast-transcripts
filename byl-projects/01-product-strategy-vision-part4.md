# Linear’s secret to building beloved B2B products | Nan Yu (Head of Product)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I think you see in the team at Linear that a lot of people don't see, which is that there's not actually a trade-off between speed and quality.

Nan Yu (00:00:06):
People talk about this as if there were a trade-off because when they think about speed, the thing they over-index on is rushing or being sloppy. What they should be indexing on is being really competent. If you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, you can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What does speed look like when you say it can be done quickly and high quality?

Nan Yu (00:00:30):
What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take. By the time 10% of it has passed, after week one, you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
I imagine a criticism you all get. Over time, you'll probably become a bloated piece of software as well.

Nan Yu (00:00:47):
When we examine this problem, we look at, "Well, what feature requests can we debate and what kind of feature requests do we absolutely have to say no to?" The stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes ICs hate their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Something that your head of sales shared with me is how impressed he is with the way you ask questions on customer calls and just keep digging and digging until you get to something.

Nan Yu (00:01:10):
My goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):
Today, my guest is Nan Yu. Nan is Head of Product at Linear, which is one of the most beloved, most beautifully designed, and also the fastest growing B2B SaaS product out there today. You rarely see the kind of love that people have for Linear for any enterprise B2B SaaS product. So, there is a lot that we can learn from how Linear operates and how they build product. In my conversation with Nan, he shares a system that he uses for being creative and coming up with non-obvious solutions to customer problems, why it's a red flag to him when PMs tell him there's a trade-off between speed and quality, how he talks to customers in order to figure out the emotion that they want to avoid and then figure out the solution to avoiding that emotion, plus some killer advice on how to land a job, including how he landed his job at Linear and his previous role at Mode, and so much more.

(00:02:06):
If you have a desire to build a company or a product that's as beloved as Linear, this episode will give you a ton of tactics and ways to change how you and your team operate. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Nan Yu.

This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the Customer Communications Cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including 8 of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products, and there's something big happening in messaging that product teams to know about, Rich Communication Services, or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience. Plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies, and here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world, and they're helping Lenny's Podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

(00:04:56):
Nan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nan Yu (00:04:59):
Thanks for having me. I'm a long-time listener and reader, so it's really a treat to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
I want to share something with you to kick off that I haven't shared with you yet, that I haven't shared with anyone. These results might have come out by the time this podcast comes out, but I'm running a survey right now that I'm calling, "What's in your stack?" Where all my subscribers are asked, "What tools do you use most day to day? What tools do you love most? What tools do you hate?" And one of the questions asked was, what tool do you wish you could switch to if your IT department allowed you to? The number one answer by far is people want to switch from Jira to Linear.

Nan Yu (00:05:38):
Wow. I mean, hopefully, that means we're doing a good job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I think that's exactly what that means. I'll read a couple quotes to give you a sense of what people are saying about Linear. I doubt these are surprising to you, but this gives people a sense of why you're here and why I'm excited to extract as much wisdom as I can from you. So, a couple quotes here. "Linear is a joy to use as I interact with my engineering teams, and I find inspiration in its design." "Linear is simple to use, yet powerful." "Linear's design is obviously an industry benchmark, but moreover, the performance and speed is a massive productivity boost."

Nan Yu (00:06:12):
I mean, it's really good to hear that because in a lot of ways, that's what we're trying to do. If you think about the entire impetus behind why Linear was started, it's because Karri was sitting at Coinbase and Airbnb and these places and just watching everyone around him struggle using the tools that they had available and always incumbent tools and just seeing that it made people hate their day-to-day a little bit, and we all got into technology and design and engineering, all this kind of stuff because it was fun. All of us started off building stupid MySpace pages and all of these side projects when we were young, and it started off as this fun thing that we do, and we're like, "Wow, we get to do this for a career," and then to have all of this kind of stuff put these big speed bumps into our day-to-day workflow, it just was really sad. So, that's why we started Linear. This really bust through all of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:11):
What I love about Linear, I feel like it's an inspirational business because many people want to, "I'm going to build just a much better version of something," and often that doesn't actually work out. Often nobody cares enough. There's all these barriers and reasons. People don't switch to something that's better, and Linear is an amazing example of building an excellent product and actually succeeding, and there's a lot more to it maybe than just building an awesome product. So, that's what I'm excited to dig into and understand how you all operate, and I guess just based on these results, to me, this is the ultimate sign of product market fit. People being sad they can't use a product in B2B enterprise software especially, so let's get into it.

(00:07:52):
First question I want to get into is something that I think you see and the team at Linear sees that a lot of people don't see, which is that there's not actually a trade-off between speed and quality. I think a lot of people think this is just an innate fact and something I've heard you talk about is that's not actually true. I actually saw Patrick Collison tweet this exact point that I'll read after you... I want to hear your thoughts, but talk about what you've learned about how there's maybe not actually this trade-off between speed and quality.

Nan Yu (00:08:20):
People talk about this as if there were a trade-off almost in a naive way because when they think about speed, the thing they over index on is rushing or being sloppy, and what they should be indexing on is being really competent or being like an expert. So, if you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, it could be anything. It could be like a chef or a programmer or someone building houses or something. You can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going. If they're going really fast, and they're obviously not being sloppy and then leaving a mess all over the place, it's like, "Yeah. Well, they got there because this is just second nature to them," and they're able to go at a really rapid pace and try stuff. And when we're building software, that's such a big component of how good the product is on the other side of it, which is like, "How many iterations were you able to do?" So, the only way you're going to get a bunch of iterations done and try different things and really feel out these different variations is by just going very fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):
In terms of speed, is the speed there moving quickly on each of iterations? Like what does speed look like when you say, "It can be done quickly and high quality"? What does speed look like?

Nan Yu (00:09:36):
Speed... What it really looks like is you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take, and by the time 10% of it has passed, you have a workable solution. It's not like, "Oh, at the halfway point, we have something that is maybe a candidate that we can play around with." It's like, no, no, no. After week one you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally so that you can feel like is this thing actually panning out the way we expect it to or did we have some crazy incorrect assumption? And you don't want to wait until you're 80% done to be able to make that kind of judgment because then it's just too late. Then you're pushing deadlines out, and you're making your marketing team very sad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Amazing. Okay, so the way you think is, "We're going to spend a month on this feature. Let's get something workable. We can start testing with potential users even internally in the first few days, essentially in the first week"?

Nan Yu (00:10:30):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:32):
Yeah. I guess how can you do that? Because most teams can't do that. Most teams need to research, design, build. "Okay, cool. We have something," and once a month later, what allows you to do that?

Nan Yu (00:10:43):
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of components of it. I think having really good talent really helps. Having engineers who don't get blocked by every single little design choice, they're happy to just make something workable. Even if they don't feel comfortable with that particular solution, they'll just bust through it and make something happen there. Part of it is intent. We don't have any expectation that the first version of it is going to be great. That is not in the cards. Look, the first version of it is our best guess in the general direction of what we want to actually ship in the end, and sometimes it works out. Sometimes, it's like, "Wow, this first version was pretty good. Let's make some minor adjustments, and we're good to go," but there's no expectation there. So, no one feels like they have to be a perfectionist and get everything, like all sanded down and really in tip-top shape. It just has to work and get the job done and validate or invalidate our major assumptions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:38):
I'll read this quote from Patrick Collison. He tweeted this today as I was preparing for this interview, and he's the CEO and founder of Stripe, if you're not familiar. His tweet is, "I increasingly believe that 'good, cheap, fast -- choose two' maxim is devious misinformation spread by the slow. In my experience, slow and expensive usually go together."

Nan Yu (00:11:57):
Yeah, exactly. I mean, use the contractor kind of example. Like If someone's making modifications to their house, and it's taking forever, one, you're in a hotel and also the bills are adding up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
The other example you used when we were chatting about this earlier is chess players. I'm thinking of Magnus Carlsen, watching him. I think he was number one in speed chess in addition to just regular chess and what a microcosm of this point.

Nan Yu (00:12:22):
Yeah, I think that's the case and Magnus and Hikaru and all those guys who are at the top of their game, they can go unbelievably fast. In fact, that's the usual... I mean, I don't want to get too out of my depth with chess, but the usual way you try to make the game fair is you give them much, much less time than someone who's not quite as strong of a player, and they'll still win a lot of time, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:43):
So, maybe just to close out this point and give someone something concrete they can do with this information, say they want to start moving faster while not cutting quality, what do you think they can do? What's one thing they can start trying to work on and improving in the way they operate?

Nan Yu (00:12:58):
I think it's really that sort of attitude and point of view question to understand and take the almost controlled risk that the first version of this is not going to be perfect. So, it actually makes it a lot cheaper in many ways. It means you don't need a pixel perfect design. It means you don't need to make sure that all of the little UI bugs and stuff like that are solved because none of that really matters. What matters is you have working software that you can interact with, and you can see if it feels good. Does it actually solve the core problem that is facing our users? You can take it back to users. You can even let them into an early beta or something like that and get real validation there and to really focus on getting the smallest, shippable element, like not shippable in the sense of, "I can actually put on the production," but in the sense of like, "I can start learning from here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):
Just a question I imagine is in everyone's mind is what do you do with this first very ugly V1... not ugly, not fully ready, first version. Is this something you're using internally to see if it's something? Is it something you have beta design partners with?

Nan Yu (00:14:04):
We have a gradually increasing sort of circle of users that use every single feature. So, by the time it hits GA, by the time it gets released, it's been used by a lot of different users up to that point. So, the first circle is just internal users. We use Linear every single day to write software and do our own work, so we have that kind of advantage and then once we feel like it's good enough, we'll put it into some beta customer group, and again, as early as we can in the process. We have to make sure that we don't end up corrupting people's data, and it doesn't look hideous and that kind of stuff, but as long as it reaches that level of quality, we can release it to early access customers who can give us good feedback and also just try to solve their problems with it. If no one engages with it, if no one's using it, then that's a good signal that we didn't really hit the mark, and then we have a couple of different beta audiences that we grow and then the ultimate release obviously is for GA where everyone gets it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
That's an amazing answer. Okay, so secret number one to Linear success, I'm going to take some notes here, is get new feature, product ideas out to people as early as possible, say, in the first 10% of the amount of time you've allotted, and then release it increasingly to more and more people to get feedback. I think the implication here is just most wasted time is on building things nobody actually ends up wanting or using. So, the sooner you at least get directional sense of are you heading in a good direction, the faster it all go?

Nan Yu (00:15:30):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):
I imagine a criticism you all get. People are like, "Yes, Linear is so great, so beautiful, so much better than what's been out there for decades," but over time you'll probably become a bloated piece of software as well. That's just the fate of enterprise software. You have to check all these checkboxes. IT teams need all these features. So, there's always this like, "Oh, yeah, sure, you guys can operate this way for now. You have an amazing product for now, but it'll get ugly and bloated." How do you think about avoiding that? I know it's something you spent a lot of time thinking about. Maybe give us a glimpse into some of the conversations you have internally when there's these feature requests like, "Oh, I need single sign-on with this thing and this button here." How do you think about what to add, what not to add, and how to add these features to not make it bloated?

Nan Yu (00:16:14):
This question actually comes to us a lot from candidates that are interviewing with us. When you go like, "Hey, do you have any questions for us?" This is the question that we're going to get. So, we hear it quite a lot, and it's very sensible for them to ask it because they see history being littered with the corpses of startups trying to compete in this space and not making it, and I think when we examine this problem, we look at, "Well, what kind of feature requests can we debate and what kind of feature requests do we absolutely have to say no to?" And the stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is also the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes ICs hate their lives, and it's very specific. It's customization features requested by middle managers in order to make reporting a little bit easier at the cost of making IC workflows worse.

(00:17:16):
It's like if it fits that description, we're just saying, "No." There's no debate because we've already thought about it and this is the thing that we can't take a single step down this path. So, I think that's honestly one of the core promises of Linear is that we will not make this particular trade-off. So, when you see people saying like, "Wow, Linear is so much faster. It's so much easier to use and it makes my work so much more enjoyable." This is the reason because we have not taken a single step in this direction. It's very easy for a PM to say yes to this kind of request because often they're talking with buyers. Any kind of B2B type of space, they're talking with whoever the gatekeeper is and sales is putting pressure on them, and they're saying like, "Hey, we really want this one feature. It's going to make our reporting nicer." 

(00:18:02):
So, the director's going to be really excited by this, and we'll definitely make a buying decision based off of this, and we have to convince them that this is a false trade-off. The whole premise is wrong because the moment you start going down this path, and you make the IC user experience worse, they're just going to disengage. No one has to do this. If I'm an engineer, I get paid to write code. My performance review is based on my code contribution. It's not based on like, "Did I fill in all the tickets right?" So, I'm just not going to do that part, or I'm going to do it very sporadically, and then I'm going to just focus on my actual job. 

(00:18:38):
And then all your reporting is wrong because all the data is wrong, and it's sparse, and you get situations where people will... They'll say like, "Well, here's a dropdown field that someone put in here that's required." There's nine choices. I don't know what any of them meet, so I'm just going to pick one at random. I'm still going to pick the first one. Also, I'm going to pray that my boss is not actually using this data to do any kind of reporting and that has consequence because the data can't possibly be correct. So, I think for us, it's a very easy decision when it comes to that particular category of feature request.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:12):
I love how simple and clear that is. Basically, you all have a policy. We'll prioritize ICs over middle managers. Especially, like I love that it's around reporting. Almost always it sounds like, "I want to track what's happening."

Nan Yu (00:19:23):
Yeah, exactly. It's always, "I want to track what's happening." Well, what do you want to track? Well, I want to track which version of the product this thing's tied to based on some field information. It's like, okay, how is the person working on this supposed to even know that information? Well, it takes like a five-minute scavenger hunt every single time. It's like, "I don't think they're going to do that, man."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:43):
What I imagine happens, and I think why this is hard for most companies is there's an implication that you're turning down deals. You're not adding that one feature that will close a massive million-dollar sale, very difficult to do. I imagine it helps a lot that... I imagine the COO is very bought into this and there's this, "We will win long-term holding the line on this." Is that right?

Nan Yu (00:20:05):
So, it is, but I also think that there's not as much pressure as you would expect to do these kinds of things. There are basic scaling things, like we had to make SAML and SCIM and that kind of stuff. It's like, "Yeah, sure, we're going to do those sorts of, like keep the lights on type of work," but when it comes to work that's related to the actual business logic of the app's value proposition, what buyers care about is, is this going to make their team more effective? That's the reason that they're making this buying decision in the first place is that they're like, "Well, the current situation we're in... " And especially with large companies, right? The current situation we're in is a mess, and if we can convince them that these types of things are actually the reason that it's a mess, then we can really navigate them out of wanting them in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:57):
Got it. So, there's an element of you think you need this, but it turns out you'll be more successful and get everything you want, not getting this?

Nan Yu (00:21:04):
Yeah, and the thing is, it's not everything you want, right? Because people come with a laundry list, and it's like laundry list. Here's 10 things I want. You're like, "Do you want all of those 10 things equally?" They're like, "No, actually I don't." The first three are the things that really matter to us. If we solve the first three, then the other stuff, we can negotiate on. So, our job is to solve the first three-way better than anybody else that if they got through the first three through some kind of visual programming, customization type of thing, that it's never going to get to the quality level and the depth that we're able to offer by offering those as native features.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:37):
It's interesting thinking back to that survey I shared where the tool people want to switch to if IT allowed them was Linear, and on the one hand you could argue, "Well, okay, IT is not letting them use Linear for all these reasons.  On the other hand, you guys are growing really quickly within enterprise, like you're a new business. You started, I think, mid-market startups, and now you're working way up. So, I think it's not fair to say it's not going to work in enterprise. It's clearly working really well. I don't know if there's any stats you can share anything of that, but it seems to be going well, expanding up market.

Nan Yu (00:22:11):
Yeah, I mean, growth has been good. Growth in enterprise has been leading the other segments because I think this year, especially we reached a tipping point where I think with software, so much of the buying decision is based on almost like a brand thing, like is this for us? A lot of times people pick "enterprise software." It's like, "Why? You know everyone doesn't want this," and they're like, "Yeah, but it's for us." 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):
You won't get fired for buying Microsoft or whatever.

Nan Yu (00:22:39):
Yeah, exactly, and I think that we're starting to have enough brand penetration amongst enterprises where people can have that feeling, right? They're like, "Hey, Linear is for us. Who are we? Well, we are a large company that wants to act like a startup." It's like, "Who doesn't want that? Who doesn't want to go fast?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:58):
Yeah. I had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast, and this is exactly what crossing the chasm looks like. He talked about basically you need someone that's across the chasm like a later adopter that isn't the person that's, "I love new stuff, and I'm an early adopter kind of evangelist." You need someone that's like traditional old school, takes their time to start to adopt it for you to be like, "Oh, okay. Now, maybe I should really take it seriously."

Nan Yu (00:23:21):
I also think that with this particular category of tool, and with a lot of other B2B software, not... Like no means not now, right? Not right now because it doesn't fit our budget. It doesn't fit our change management situation. "Oh, we have this exec that's really wedded to this other tool," but those things change, right? So, we keep in contact with them. They're in our CRM where we make sure we follow up, and we've had a lot of these where we've been said no to, like two years ago, and now we have some new features, and then go like, "Oh, yeah, it seems like you're ready for our scale," or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):
You mentioned that when you have these debates and questions that come out, you have features that a big company wants. There's this category of, "We know we will not build things for middle managers that want reporting and custom stuff just to track what's happening," versus something an IC wants to be more productive and successful, Linear. Give us a little sense of some of the more complicated debates that aren't necessarily in that bucket.

Nan Yu (00:24:22):
I think the complicated debates are often when we do add a new native feature, do we extend an existing feature and make it more powerful or do we add a new sort of service? And a big part of that is trying to figure out exactly who's going to use it, what are the actual real life use cases that we know about? Like that I know that Bob from Company X has this workflow and this is how it would work for him. Here are the different variations where it would work. So, tying it all the way back to real people is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:52):
Like a specific person?

Nan Yu (00:24:53):
Yeah, specific person. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Not a hypothetical person. Not one that you made up like Alice, Bob, or whatever. It's like, "No, here's the first name, last name. Here's their email. You can ask them," and I think that being able to tie it all the way back to reality in that way is a big part of how we really think about and discuss these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This connects the way I think about my newsletter is I always try to answer the question a very specific, like a person actually asked, not a general sense of something people may be interested in, and that very specific question, like it implies there's a need. Like not implies, it proves there's at least one person who needs this thing versus you have this idea of somebody that may want this thing. 

Nan Yu (00:25:36):
Yeah. I think a trap that a lot of times PMs will fall into is they'll make something, and they'll make some choices in it because maybe it's beautiful or it's elegant, but they don't go the step of like, "Is reality also beautiful and elegant?" Because reality is ugly sometimes, and if you have a beautiful and elegant solution that doesn't match with reality, it doesn't really matter. People can look at it, and they can ooh and ah, but if they don't use it to get their work done, it's never going to have long-term staying power.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
Do you have a heuristic of how often you need to hear something for you to... could be just convinced, this is worth investing in? People may hear this, "Oh, one Bob. Bob wants this featured." That doesn't make sense. It's just one guy. How do you know when it's like, "Okay, we should really invest in this"?

Nan Yu (00:26:17):
Part of it is you hear something, and you're like, "Gosh, that actually is... " Not only is that true. It means that the way we thought about this was a little bit wrong, and I call this process... I don't know if it's the right way to describe it. I call it a kneeling where you have a thing, and it's not quite the right shape, and you put it out into the wild. So, this happens way in the first bit of the life of a particular feature. You release a thing, and then you start getting feedback about it, about hey, it doesn't quite fit reality, and then you ask yourself like, "Did we test that aspect of it? Did we actually match that part to reality?" And if you didn't, then it's like that's the part where you don't actually need that many pieces of feedback against it. It's not really a volume thing. It's like, "Did we think about this right or wrong?" That's one sort of category.

(00:27:01):
Another category is just you're getting a request for maybe a very big feature or a feature set from a lot of different people, but then you dig in, and you try to say like, "Okay. Well, tell me about how you're trying to use this," and there's 100 different use cases. So, you have choices here. You can either build the big feature that covers all the long tail of use cases or you can try to see if there's really concentrated pools of use cases for this that really make a lot of sense to adopt as a first order type of feature. So, I think those are the two sort of strategies that we employ the most. It's like, "Did we think about this wrong? And now we're just learning something about how it matches reality or for this big general feature that people are asking for, are there actually more specific use cases that we should be solving, and we should be solving really, really well?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
A thread that's coming through so far across a lot of these examples is getting to the specific person using the thing and making them happy and making sure the ask is going to solve their actual problem. In the case of looking at the IC versus the middle manager, in this case, it's like, "Let's talk to the person actually asking for this thing," not, "There's like 100 people generally asking for this thing and let's build what we think is a general solution."

Nan Yu (00:28:18):
Yeah. I'll give you an example of all of these things, which we just launched a feature called Customer Requests, and basically what this does, it adds a new concept of Linear, which is a customer. For B2B companies, this is very relevant, and the reason we did this is because we kept getting this request for fully customized fields, and we would be like, "Well, what is it that you want with your custom fields?" Because the problem is you add 100 custom fields and all your ICs start hating it. So, we don't want to go down that path, but what is it actually you're trying to do? And 40% of them were because, "Well, I have a customer," like Walmart or whatever, right? Like, "Walmart asked for this feature, and it's really important. I need everyone to know that Walmart needs this. I need to track it. I need to see how have we report... " 

(00:29:09):
We can report on what have we done for Walmart over the past year so that when my CSM has a one-on-one conversation with a rep, they can have some kind of evidence that we've been doing stuff for them, like all this kind of stuff. We're like, "Okay. Cool." That sounds like a very useful and powerful thing you want to do. How do you expect people to tag these things? Well, manually, because that's how we did it in our spreadsheets. It's like, "Okay, instead of that, we're going to hook up with your customer support tools. We're going to hook up with your CRNs. We're going to automatically bring in feedback from these companies. We're going to analyze the emails where they're from, and then if someone requests a feature that gets escalated into engineering, it'll just be tagged with whoever asked for it. You don't have to do anything, but you will know, and you can still report on this stuff, but there's nothing about this that makes ICs lives harder.

(00:29:54):
In fact, it makes them feel more confident because when they're building the thing, they actually understand who's asking for it and exactly what the email said. So, when they're doing the design or the details, they can actually see the real-life use cases that are present and solve for those directly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:09):
As I'm hearing this, it's like, "Okay, obviously, this seems like an obvious solution. Of course, 40% of people telling me they have customers." In reality, most of the time, if you hear from a bunch of your customers, "Hey, I need this custom field," and sometimes you hear one thing, sometimes you hear another. Most of the time you're going to build this custom field. Something that your head of sales shared with me is how impressed he is with the way you ask questions on customer calls and just keep digging and digging until you get to something that is an insight for you, and then you start to try to solve the problem for them and think about what the product might be, and I think this is such an important and underappreciated skill for PMs. Is there any advice you could share of just how you approach this, how you ask questions, how you think about these customer calls to get to, "Okay, now, I see what we need to build versus let's just build what they're asking for"?

Nan Yu (00:30:59):
It's funny because I think from the outside, I'm on these sales calls and then the AE or someone's watching me ask these questions, and I think often they're like, "What are you doing? You're just asking questions from angles that I don't even know what your goal is here," and my goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad. They come to us with a request, "Hey, we want X," and it's like there's something motivating it and you can do the normal analytical thing and be like, "Ask five whys," and try to figure out like, "Well, what are your goals?" "And as a persona X, I want to achieve this outcome." You can do it that way, but you might miss the reason that they actually feel bad for not having this thing like, "I can't accomplish this goal. So what?" "So, I'm not going to get promoted at work."

(00:31:44):
Okay, great. I understand the severity of your problem at this point. What is the actual emotional valence that is motivating whatever you're telling me? And it takes a little while to get there. You can ask people directly like, "How do you feel?" And they're not necessarily going to tell you, but if you have a long enough and deep enough conversation with them, you start to level with them, and you're starting to see stuff from their perspective, and the more you see it from their perspective and the more they know that, the more they're willing to open up to you and tell you like, "Okay, honestly, I had this thing happen where I marked the ship date of this project as December 30th because it's a Q4 project, and I wanted to put it at the very end, and then my marketing team lost their mind because they're like, 'We can't ship something on December 30th. Everyone's on vacation,'" and you're like... And then they're like, "Yeah, this has made me feel really bad." 

(00:32:36):
So, I don't ever want to put dates on things ever again. So, like, "Okay, cool. We can help you deal with that. If that's what you're feeling, then I can start building stuff to make sure that you never have to have that bad feeling again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
People talk about empathy like, "You need to have empathy as a PM. You need to build empathy the best product leaders, have empathy in this." I think it's such a succinct and powerful way of describing what empathy actually looks like as a product leader, which is I want to feel as bad as they feel in hearing the story they tell, and it sounds like the way you do that is you keep asking questions to understand the moment they felt bad about something. In this case, the deadline.

Nan Yu (00:33:17):
And if you ask somebody in that last story, like what kind of issue do you have? You're like, "Oh, marketing and I would just never align on anything." It's like that doesn't really tell you what's going on. What it tells you is you had this terrible moment of communication that it's all miscommunicated, and you're like, "It's just going to keep happening over and over again." So, the thing that we did specifically to solve this was on projects in Linear, you can just specify a target date at whatever level of granularity you want. You can say it's a December project. You can say it's a Q4 project. You can say it's a second half of 2024 project. Like whatever you're happy promising, you can just put it on there and that way you never feel like you have to give this sense of false precision so that it ends up with a whole bunch of miscommunication down the line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:04):
I could see why people love Linear is it just makes them feel less bad less often. There's a lot of connection here. I know this idea of emotions and feeling bad is a core part of how you think about building product, looking for moments. People feel bad. Is there anything more you could share there to share how you think about this idea of emotional hooks, emotional moments, and how you decide what to build?

Nan Yu (00:34:27):
So, to set the background of this, I've worked in very, very competitive industries. I worked at Everlane, which was a direct-to-consumer clothing brand. I worked in Mode, which is like BI tools and there's so many BI tools out there, and then obviously, Linear. We're project management. There's a lot of project management tools, and I think the more competitive your industry is, the more the low-hanging goal-oriented stuff is already picked because every PM from every one of these companies has been asking like, "Well, what's your goal? What is your job to be done," and all this kind of stuff. So, you have to look at things from an angle that other people might not have seen and for me, and for us, it's the angle of where are the emotional hooks that you're experiencing as you go through your work day, as you use our product, as you use competitors' products?

(00:35:21):
I think it's probably underexplored because... I don't know. I feel like PMs and engineers, we're like very thinky people. We avoid the touchy-feely stuff. So, I think that's the opportunity. You can see where are you feeling bad throughout your day where you don't even know? You might think, "I hate Mondays." "Why do you hate Mondays?" "Well, on Mondays, I have to go out and gather a whole bunch of stuff to write this report that it's really annoying." "Oh, so if I gave you a button that made the report, would that help?" It's like, "Oh, yeah, then I might not hate Monday so much." So, I think Paul Graham has a word for this. He calls it schlep blindness, right? It's like I'm schlepping through life, and I'm just completely blind to it, and it's true. You have to have an outsider come in and see what the rhythm of your feelings are throughout the day, throughout the week, and you note the spots where you could really use a lot of improvement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Is there an example? I've shared a couple, but just where you've noticed this in someone using maybe a competitor or even Linear that you solved. I know you gave an example of the dates. I guess is there anything else?

Nan Yu (00:36:26):
A big feature that people love about Linear is we have this thing called Triage Management, and what it does is it systemizes this thing where if I put an issue into a different team, if I'm asking them to do something or I'm reporting a bug to them, it sticks in a special zone where it'll notify the right people. They're on a rotation and people will be able to respond to it in an organized manner, and I think this kind of automation, this feature, it came out of two different fields people were having. One, people were trying to implement this stuff by hand, and it was just a lot of touches, and they were doing it, but they felt like, "Oh, I'm totally underwater." "Why are you under water?" "Well, I have to throw all these tickets around and route them correctly and stuff like that," and they didn't see this as an opportunity to have a tool specialize in managing their triage queue. 

(00:37:23):
Because they were managing by hand.... They were on top of it, but it just felt really bad because they just had to spend so much attention doing this and then there's the folks who didn't do that. The feeling was just like, "Well, it's totally out of control. People are just throwing tickets over the wall, and I don't know what to do with them. I don't know where they are. They end up in all these holes and then the people on the other side are like, "I throw tickets over the wall. I have no idea what happens to them. I have no expectation that people are ever going to respond to them." So, there's all of these bad feelings that people are having. They all have the same root cause, which is like there wasn't a very automated organized way to deal with your triage queue.

(00:38:55):
I'm going to try to summarize some of the secrets of Linear's success so far. So, the first is get something out as quickly as possible, say, in the first 10% of the time that you have to build this thing and get it out to internal users and then maybe a growing list of beta users and people that are aware of they're using early stuff. Two is prioritize the IC and the user, basically, versus the buyer or the middle manager that wants reporting and all these custom features. So, it's basically focused on the user, which I think you hear a lot, but I love this very specific example. Three is when you hear asks for features and requests, get to the specific person using the thing, not just general, "Okay, cool. I've heard it 100 times." Find the person that actually needs this thing and understand what's going on, and then four is look for people feeling bad in a moment working in the product. Is there anything else that I'm missing that's important or any nuance you want to add?

Nan Yu (00:39:54):
The part where you said, like focus on the user, I think it's maybe a little bit more subtle than that. There's a nuance which is find where the incentives are really misaligned amongst your user base. There's a middle manager that wants really detailed reporting and there's a IC who just really doesn't want to go through all those extra steps, and the incentives for what they want are just very... They're just very misaligned, and you have to find those situations and be pretty judicious about how you make those trade-offs and where you can really find win-win outcomes there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:30):
That's a really important nuance. Something else that's come through a couple of times as you've been talking is also something Patrick Collison tweeted once that has stuck with me, which is this idea of having a mental model in your head of the user. So, the way he described it and the way you've described it is oftentimes people are like, "Cool. We're going to figure out what to build. We're going to do a bunch of research, talk to users. That'll inform what we build, and we build it, versus what you've been saying and what he said is you do a bunch of research, look at data, talk to people. That informs your mental model of what the customer needs in their life, and then that informs what you build. So, that anytime you do more research, talk to customers, it's informing your view of the person, and then you're like, "Oh, this was different from what I imagined," or, "Oh wow. This is exactly what we've been thinking and let's build that." Anything along those lines that you might want to share?

Nan Yu (00:41:19):
Yeah, I mean, I can tell you a little bit about how we manage our backlog, which I think actually ties directly into this. At any given moment, we have probably 20 or 30 opportunities that we could possibly explore, just product opportunities, like problems to solve, areas to improve for our users, but they're not ready yet. We don't have enough conviction around how we might approach it. So, we just accumulate understanding of this stuff and periodically, we accumulate some more stuff, and then we reevaluate, "Okay, what is our current understanding of how we might best approach this thing?" And I think something that people struggle with is that they might have this model in their head. Like a PM might have this model in their head about how a user behaves, but it's just very hard to share that with someone else. You have to telepathically throw it into their brain, which is hard. So, what we try to do is identify areas that we might attack with a product, but also keep an up-to-date analysis of each of those areas so that everyone can engage with it and also contribute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:22):
Is there an example of something that's sitting in your roadmap? I don't know if you could share these sort of things that's just sitting in the backlog of just like, "We're not quite ready to tackle this yet, but here's something we're inkling on."

Nan Yu (00:42:31):
Yeah, sure. Capacity planning is a thing that's been sitting in our backlog, and it's something that we see managers struggle with all the time, which is like I have a limited amount of personnel and resources, and I need to deploy them in such a way where we can theoretically accomplish our roadmap, but also we don't get blocked by some bottleneck that we don't end up blocking all of the projects because this one engineer is stuck on some info thing, and that's a thing people struggle with all the time. All the solutions out there are bad. The best solution is a very, very custom spreadsheet that someone would make, and it's a lot of upkeep. So, we have some ideas about how we might automate this, how we might use existing data within Linear to really help out with this problem, but I don't think we've quite cracked it yet. 

(00:43:18):
I think there's some nuances that we have to really explore a little bit further. So, we're continuously developing this, and as we hear from hear from users that are struggling with this problem, we will get on a call with them and sit down with them and talk through it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:31):
And the idea there is keep informing this mental model, keep informing what this could be until you get to a place of like, "Okay. Cool. I think we figured out what will really solve this problem in an elegant way"?

Nan Yu (00:43:42):
Yeah, and I want to really stress a nuance here, which is it's not that we want to solve the entire problem. The entire problem is quite big, but there's something that's really right for Linear to do that would help people have a good starting point for them to reason about it. So, I think a lot of building conviction around stuff is not even like do we have a workable solution? It's like how much of the problem should we actually take on? Because if we take on too much of the problem, then we'll end up overpromising and not being able to deliver on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I think what's also useful here is you all keep your team very small intentionally and being constrained keeps you from taking on these things too early because you don't have the engineers to build their designers.

Nan Yu (00:44:24):
Yeah, that's true. I actually hadn't really put that part together, but I think some of the reason we've done it this way is because we don't have the bandwidth to action everything. So, we have this backlog that we maintain to make sure that when we do take it on, we're pretty set up for success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:41):
Yeah, it's interesting. I think a lot of companies are starting to realize that they can build better products and move faster with fewer teams. I want to move in a different direction and talk a bit about how you actually think about building new products. Something that I've heard from you is that you have a systemized way of being creative, which I think is a dream for a lot of people's. It's like how do I be more creative? How do I think of new innovative concepts? You have a really interesting process for how you do this. Can you talk about it?

Nan Yu (00:45:09):
Yeah, totally. I think when people talk about being creative, a lot of times what they have a problem with is extrapolating. They can see the stuff that's right in front of them, but what about two or three steps down the line? And then it's just like, "Well, there's just so much possibility. I don't know what direction to go." So, the way that we try to do it is we ask a question which is like, "Okay, how extreme can you take it? You're designing a product. You're trying to come up with a solution. What's the most outrageous version of this along some trait?" I don't know if you guys did this at Airbnb, but I think Brian Chesky talks about like, "What's the 11-star experience?" Is that a thing you guys did?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:51):
It was a thing he talked about. Yeah, there's always a push of what's the 10X version of some idea.

Nan Yu (00:45:57):
When you think in that way, when you're saying like, "Hey, what's the 11-star experience?" What you're really asking is like, "Hey, what's the most luxurious version of this hotel stay? Or what's the most unforgettable kind of experience we can give people?" And you throw away things, I don't know, like cost. You throw away things like practicality because that's not what's interesting. What's interesting is I want to actually explore the possibility space, and I think this is really important to do because the goal is to get you to see beyond your defaults. We have all of these constraints that we're operating under that we psychically have in the back of our heads that we just don't even realize we have them. So, just break past all of them, and then you can really see what your options are because we talk about product decisions. It's like, "Oh, yeah, you have these choices. What are you going to decide?" There's all this decision-making kind of theory.

(00:46:52):
But the biggest risk is you didn't see the right choice to begin with. You have these three choices and none of them were right. It's this fourth one that was over in this corner, but you didn't look in that corner, so you never found it. So, I think the whole goal of this is to try to expand the search space of what you're trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:09):
So, what you're saying is people often don't think out of the box enough by not thinking too radically enough. So, the choices they're deciding between are just meh options and there's this process of breaking out of that, and I think you could hear this and be like, "Yeah, sure." I could spend 10 minutes being like, "Oh, hey, what's the craziest [inaudible 00:47:35]- "

Nan Yu (00:47:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
But you're saying that actually is what you do and that actually works really well?

Nan Yu (00:47:39):
Yeah, and you actually build it. You can think of a very extreme version of a product and you can say, "Hey, let's actually... " For the first version, we talked about, like the first version, you know it's not really the right answer. Sometimes, you know it's so hard because you know this is the most extreme version of the answer. So, let's build that as fast as we can and see how it feels, and then we're going to learn so much about what the right actual answer is because we have seen this area of the product space and really felt it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:05):
Awesome. Let's talk about an example of this because this feels awesome.

Nan Yu (00:48:09):
Yeah, I can talk to an example. Actually, is it okay if I demo something?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:13):
Absolutely. Let's do it. Show and tell.

Nan Yu (00:48:15):
Yeah, let me do that right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:16):
Here we go. We're going to share screen.

Nan Yu (00:48:18):
All right. So, this is just like a demo space instead of Linear. So, the feature where we did this that I remember very clearly, because it was recent, is we built this feature to save drafts for your issues. So, Linear, as hard as an issue tracker, if I make a new issue and let's say I'm trying to report a bug or something, so it's like I make a bug report, then I might start thinking through like, "Okay, what are the repro steps?" And then I start typing them, and this happens all the time. When you're at work, you're doing this and someone distracts you. If someone pings you on Slack or you have to go to a meeting or something like that, you're like, "I got to put this away for a second. I'll come back to it later." Note to self, figure out the actual repro steps and do it.

(00:48:56):
So, what can you do? Well, you want to save it as a draft. So, we're like, "Okay, this is the problem," and the first version of this, we're like, "What do we want to do? Linear is about being fast." So, we don't want to get in your way. We want to say like, "What is the fastest draft saving experience possible?" So, if you save it as draft, you can save it as draft. If you decide to not... you want to throw it away, you don't want it, just hit the X button, and it'll just throw it away. We're not going to interrupt you with a popup that says like, "Do you want to save your changes," or any of that kind of stuff. We'll just absolutely get out of your way fast as possible. So, we're like, "What's the risk here?" Well, it might feel really unsafe.

(00:49:31):
If you close this, and we don't ask you if you want to save change, you might feel like, "Oh, I just lost my changes on accident." We knew that going in. We built this anyway, and it felt super unsafe. It turns out that sort of inkling that we had was true, and we really felt exactly how unsafe it was. So, then we were like, "Okay, well, what's the safest thing we could possibly do?" The safest thing is just auto save everything. So, you start a new issue, and then you start typing some stuff, and it's just like auto saving as soon as you type a single character and that did feel quite safe. So, cool, but it also ended up leaving behind a whole bunch of like a paper trail of things you change your mind about. You've probably had this happen in document tools where you have a whole bunch of things in your space called like Untitled Document or New Document and stuff like that. It's just like-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
So many untitled folders.

Nan Yu (00:50:25):
Yeah, so many untitled folders because the moment you say new folder, it starts saving it, and then you don't actually mean for that to happen. So, we had those two sorts of variations that we built, and we fell through and where we ended up was a balance between those two. So, what happens is if I'm creating a new issue, like I am here, and I close it out, it'll interrupt me, like we have to interrupt you, otherwise it feels too unsafe. So, I can save the draft, I can go to my drafts, and then if I'm in this draft I've already made, and I go in there, and I start to say, "Okay, I'm going to keep working on it," but then I get interrupted again, then I'm just going to auto-save it for you. There's no point. I'm not going to ask you again.

(00:51:06):
I'm always going to auto save it because I'm not going to create a new object. I'm just making modifications in place. So, we made this very specific choice of on a brand new issue, we will interrupt you, and then on an existing draft that you're messing around with, we're just going to auto save everything and someone doing a analysis. If they did a detailed teardown of these decisions, they might say like, "Wow, they made very specific choices here," but the path to get there is to do something totally extreme in one direction and then totally extreme in another direction and then find where they really meet up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):
Such a good example, the way that you described it is you went like here's the safest route. Here's the fastest version. Where did you come up with these list of options? And for folks that are trying to do this for their company, are these like... Because these are Linear principles, we're going to be very fast. Is this the way you think most companies should operate these sorts of attributes? Do you think it's specific to what makes their product different? How do you think about that?

Nan Yu (00:52:04):
I think for a lot of companies, you have to ask, "What is the promise that your product or your business is making people?" It might be you always have a car available if you need it, and if you do that, then maybe we're going to have to implement search pricing to make that happen. It's always going to be available. So, here's the trade-off that we have to make. It's a very extreme point of view to do that. Or you might say the price is always predictable, but sometimes you can't have a car in the first place. Those are all choices that you get to make, and you have to sort decide, like where in that spectrum does it make sense based on the promise of your company?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:40):
A lot of people talk about this idea of working backwards. Brian Chesky in Airbnb has a big concept of working backwards from the ideal. Let's design the best possible scenario and work backwards. I love that this is even more tactical, which is just pick the extreme version of very specific attributes. Probably not that ideal, but it'll give us insight into a version of the ideal and an element that works well and then what doesn't. Yeah, exactly. I did this a lot actually at Airbnb, just like testing the extreme. So, it super resonates, this idea, and when you say test, so was it like you build it and play with it? Do you roll it out to some of these circles of users or is it often just internal, and then you learn and then iterate?

Nan Yu (00:53:23):
Yeah, we rolled out some of these versions to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:25):
Oh, wow. Okay.

Nan Yu (00:53:27):
So, the super-fast version that was unsafe, that only went interna, and everyone felt it was too unsafe, but then we thought, "Okay, let's go to the super-safe version," and then we rolled that out and everyone started having a whole bunch of... Like how many drafts are people making? I'm like, "This is too many." The people are leaving behind this crazy paper trail. Okay, we got to figure out some difference here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Awesome. So, this very much connects to your first point of get things out really quick, and in this case, it's like extreme versions. You're probably not going to work long term, but it will teach you.

Nan Yu (00:53:56):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):
Amazing. Okay, and seeing it in action, I'm like, "Okay, obviously, this is the solution," and that's how the way this should feel, and to your point, it was not an obvious solution when you started thinking about it.

Nan Yu (00:54:08):
Yeah. I mean, the best solutions are always obvious in hindsight, and it's just like you have to develop a process internally that to eventually find your way there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:16):
Something else that you've mentioned when we were chatting that connects to some of the things we've been talking about is you have this perspective that B2B software isn't just solving people's problems, it's also teaching them how to work, and it's this accumulation of information. Can you talk about that? Because I thought that was really fascinating.

Nan Yu (00:54:38):
If you think about how a lot of B2B software gets created, it's because there was some person in the middle of some giant company who implemented some kind of process, and they're like, "Wow, this process is really working for us. Maybe we should make it easier," and they build a little tool internally and then all of their colleagues can now press on buttons and good things happen, and then they turn that process and that tool. They spin it off into a startup, and they make a startup. This process repeats thousands of times. So, when you adopt that tool, you're not just adopting the actual software, you're adopting the idea that this is a practice that you ought to be doing in the first place. So, if you're a marketing person, and you adopt some marketing software, you're not just saying, "Okay, now, I can write emails and send them to people."

(00:55:24):
There's all sorts of process around that. You're organizing stuff into campaigns. You're measuring click-through rates. You're calculating cost of acquisition and all that stuff probably comes equipped with a tool because those are the right practices to do when you're doing this sort of marketing exercise. And whether you knew about it before or you learned it from the tool, like as a buyer for this kind of product, what I'm doing is I'm saying like, "Hey, I'm going to bring in this baseline level of marketing competency into my organization, that this is the worst we can do is whatever the tool defaults are."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:58):
Interesting. So, you're basically buying into a way of working when you're adopting a piece of software, not just have this problem I need solved.

Nan Yu (00:56:06):
Yeah, exactly, and I think the most salient example of this is if you've ever seen like a company adopt an ERP product, it's the most painful thing you can imagine. It's doing deep surgery. They have to redo all of their internal processes and the way they manage inventory and all this kind of stuff, but they're willing to do it because they know that this is a battle-tested way of making sure that you're actually doing good management of resources. So, they're like, "We're growing up now. It's time for us to adopt these best practices. In order to do that, we have to adopt this tool, and we will conform to whatever the tool is best is to do."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:44):
This connects to a couple things I know about Linear, one is what you've shared of just avoiding these customizations requests from people. Do you have a very opinionated way of here's how you should operate in order to build a great functioning product, org, and company in general? I'm just connecting threads here. One is like we're going to avoid letting people customize too much because we know they'll have a bad time, and then two is just this idea of we are opinionated about the way you should work in Linear, and it's like you have a Linear method, I think it's called, of just like here's how product team should operate based on everything we've seen be successful.

Nan Yu (00:57:19):
Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely connected in a way, and I think sometimes when people talk about... You mentioned like being opinionated, and I think sometimes when people talk about being opinionated, it can feel like they're almost saying like, "Hey, this is arbitrary," like your opinion and my opinion, they're just too opinions, man. Neither is right or wrong. What we try to do is find where there's actual consensus amongst a lot of different high performing teams, and then we can take those practices and say like, "Okay, for a team that isn't already practicing this, can we give them a button so that they can start practicing this?"

(00:57:56):
When we see companies doing a really good job of managing their triage queue, but it's very manual, we're like, "Okay, can we automate this? And then for this other company that really needs it that they don't know this is what they need, can we just give them a button to activate this?" And now they have the practice within their org, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:10):
So, I think the takeaway here is when you choose a tool, recognize it's going to change the way you operate and be thoughtful about is this the way we want to work versus just we just have a problem we want solved?

Nan Yu (00:58:21):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):
I want to come back to something, a thread that's come up a couple of times in our chat is the way you collaborate internally. It feels like there's a pretty unique way. You said you were on all the sales calls. Is there anything that you can share about how you collaborate internally, how the different functions collaborate that may be unlike how other companies operate that might be helpful for them to learn from?

Nan Yu (00:58:44):
Yes. Something that's worked really, really well for us is we think of product management as partially like a go-to-market discipline in the same way that sales and marketing are, right? When you talk to people and like, "Hey, tell me how product management works in your company," they'll probably say something about like, "Well, there's engineering product and design. They work in this triad, and here's how they interact and collaborate," and we all understand why that's useful, why that's helpful, but this other form of collaboration between product management, sales and marketing, I think it's something that's probably really underexamined and often I feel like in organizations, you actually see some antagonism between product and sales and marketing, and I think that's a shame because when we come together, the way we think about the way that we think about selling is a matter of like... especially because we sell to very expert practitioners, and they have a very sensitive BS detector.

(00:59:51):
So, a big part of what we try to do is we try to help our marketing team pick exactly the right word and the right phrasing to make us sound native to the language that our customers speak and also-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):
You're talking about engineers is my sense, right?

Nan Yu (01:00:07):
Yeah. Engineers is a big one, but even product managers, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:08):
Mm-hmm.

Nan Yu (01:00:10):
Like product managers know when... They know what the job is like. So, when you come in, you say the wrong words, people give you stink eye.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Don't call them project managers.

Nan Yu (01:00:19):
Yeah, exactly, for example. So, I think that's a big part of what we have to do. So, on our PM team, we actually have a full-time product marketer, and her job is to... Tactically, it's like all the change logs come from her, all the release notes, and also she's always crafting the language for whatever upcoming release that we're building and working directly with the teams and trying to figure out how to talk about it, and then once we go out and build the campaigns, build assets and things like that, that's where a lot of the language is coming from. It's coming from the work that she's doing and then with sales, they're validating all that message in the field. They're saying the words to customers directly and telling you if it's sticking or not, and then you can have a really good feedback cycle between those three disciplines.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):
What I've seen you refer to this way of working as is a double triangle, which is I think a complement to the PM, engineer, designer. Talk about that and give us a visual of what that looks like.

Nan Yu (01:01:18):
Yeah, I think PMs, like product managers, we often have a tough time trying to explain like, "What is your job?" It's a little bit of everything. I think the job that I do that we see it as is you're taking the building side of the organization and the selling side of the organization and bringing it together. You're taking all of the commercial motivations and goals of the company and making sure that what you build actually solves for those goals, and you're tempering that with what's possible and where the opportunities are to actually build stuff. So, to me, it's the PM in the middle, and then you have engineering, product design, and then sales, marketing, product management on the other side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
PM is always in the middle-

Nan Yu (01:02:05):
Indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:06):
... but I think that's true from the perspective of PM, and I love this visual of just the PM is connecting the builders to the sellers, and you're involved in both worlds. This connects very directly to Brian Chesky's whole thing about how PMs should be doing marketing. So, the way they changed it, every PM is also PMM, and there's no more... They're product marketers now. That's their title and that's like the extreme version of what you're describing. 

Nan Yu (01:02:33):
Yeah. Yeah, and I think Apple's been doing that way for forever, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):
Got it. So, the advice here is if you're a PM at a B2B business, lean into the sales and marketing side of it, lean into the go-to-market.

Nan Yu (01:02:45):
Yeah, and in fact, if you're leaving something on the table in terms of the kind of impact that you are having at your job, that's probably the thing that you're leaving on the table. You're probably already doing a good job of collaborating with engineering and design. It's probably the sort of sell side that there's an opportunity for you to have more impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
Just to make it even more concrete for PMs that are like, "Okay, I want to do this. I want to do what Linear's doing. I'm going to get more salesy." What does it look like when someone is more is in this double triangle working more closely with sales? You talked about being on sales calls. What else there can you share of just like, "Here, try these things"?

Nan Yu (01:03:20):
I think originate the message that you send to your audience. There's a lot of things that marketing does, which you are never going to necessarily touch. There's always demand gen and figuring out channel strategy and all this kind of stuff, like sure. That's a peer marketing concern, but actually picking the words and where the emphasis is, like you should understand the customer at a pretty deep level, probably deeper than any other group at the company because of the kinds of requirements gathering, discovery that you're doing. So, you're going to know the native language that your customers speak a lot better and help your marketing team originate those words.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Got it. So, basically be really involved in the product marketing, the writing, the emails, the headlines, the website?

Nan Yu (01:04:06):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. I know the word product marketing is also so overloaded. They do so many different things, but it's that sort of content creation piece that you really have an opportunity to contributes to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:16):
Yeah, I love how concrete that is. It's like don't think about this concept, product marketing. Just think about the words that your potential customers and customers see. Okay, final area I want to spend a lot of time on is totally different. It's around getting a job. 

Nan Yu (01:04:31):
Oh, yeah. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
You have a pretty unique approach to finding a gig. I heard from the founder of Mode about the very unique way you approached getting a job there. I imagine Linear is a similar boat. What advice can you share with folks that are looking for a job, maybe struggling, that work for you when you were looking for your next gig?

Nan Yu (01:04:51):
Project management is a unique role. Because we do just about everything, you don't really get pigeonholed into being compared along a single dimension with everyone else, and everyone who's hiring PMs, just like when they're hiring execs, they're hoping that they bring them on to solve some burning problem that they have. So, it's your job when you're in the interview process to figure out what that burning problem is. So, put on your discovery hat and go figure out what is the actual job to be done of the hiring manager when they're bringing on a new PM onto their team? And if you can do that and then make a good case that you are the person to solve that problem, then hiring you becomes a binary choice between do I hire the solution to my problem or do I hire someone else?

(01:05:48):
And I think what ends up happening a lot is when you're in a interview process, you're just trying to put your best foot forward, trying to say that you're great at everything. You have very few weaknesses. Maybe you tried too hard, like whatever, but everyone's going to say that. So, you're just one of end people, and you want to make yourself a little bit of just you versus the field. You're the solution to a problem and then everyone else is like a roll of the dice. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:15):
So, the way you're describing it is the company has a job to be done, say it's drive growth of some feature. In this case, it's like for Linear, just build a killer or successful B2B product. I don't know. That's a broad one. Usually, you're not interviewing for head of product role, so that's maybe too broad. So, it's like what is this PM role's job to be done at the company and then help convince them you are the best person to do that job and solve this problem for them.

Nan Yu (01:06:42):
Yeah, and a lot of times when you take that approach, it'll feel like you already work there, and the way that I did this, like I got advice from a friend. He said like, "I was interviewing for this job at Mode that you referenced." I'm like, "How should I approach it?" He's like, "Just act like you already worked there. What would you do?" And then it's like, "Okay, I could do that." So, then when you're in this interview process and someone's asking you questions. He goes, "Do you have any questions for me?" You can ask them like, "What are your OKRs this quarter? How can someone help you achieve those?" You can be that specific about it, and they're like, "Oh, yeah, sure. I can tell you about the exact thing that I'm doing this quarter, and then you'll have some level of intelligence about what people are actually trying to solve because I think often we just get stuck in these very high level general types of questions like, "What's the company goals sand all that kind of stuff, and it's like, no, you can get really specific. If you were collaborating with that person in your job, what would you say to them?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):
I love how actionable this advice is. There's obviously an element of this takes work and time. A lot of people are interviewing at a lot of companies, trying to find a job, is part of your advice. Pick the ones you're most excited about and invest a lot of time in this way of interviewing.

Nan Yu (01:07:58):
You can invest a lot in the ones where you know that you're going to be able to over deliver on. If you understand what they're actually trying to solve, then you know where you're going to have both the highest chance of success of getting hired, but also doing a really great job on the other end of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
And you talk about how you're like pretending you have the job, pretending you actually have this job as part of the interview process. Oftentimes, as an outsider, you don't have enough information to have a really good thought on what the solution is, and maybe part of it is going to be so wrong because you're like, "I don't actually know. I don't have the data." Do you actually try to reach out to the engineers and designers on the team to try to understand things? How far do you go to try to solve these problems and show them what you can do?

Nan Yu (01:08:37):
Yeah, I mean, you're in the interview loop. These are people that you're going to be working closely with. So, start there. Do your discovery questions, and if there's an area that you think you want to dig, you can ask. There's no harm asking, "Hey, can you put me in touch with an engineering manager who's working on the same problem?" And if no one else is asking, again, you're going to have an extra piece of feedback from that eng manager. So, yeah, like this guy asks really good questions, and it seems like they're really with it. No one else is going to have that piece of feedback. So, during the debrief process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:08):
And just asking that question alone will show them how deeply you're thinking about this already?

Nan Yu (01:09:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Amazing. Nan, is there anything else that we have not covered that you want to touch on or share or you think might be helpful to listeners before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Nan Yu (01:09:30):
I have a very specific point of view on deadlines. I don't know if that's [inaudible 01:09:34] you care.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:34):
Let's do it. Fire away.

Nan Yu (01:09:38):
I think what often happens is people get depressed about deadlines. It's like, "Hey, here's the ship date," and then you never make it. I don't know if you've had this feeling before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):
Absolutely, with some deadlines.

Nan Yu (01:09:49):
You were an engineer before too, right? So, it's just like engineers is basically like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, deadlines, they're complete fabrications," and the only way to make deadlines real is to take them so seriously that they are basically like a P0 problem, and everything else has to not matter in comparison to the deadline because that's the only way you're going to be able to signal to the team and also to all the stakeholders that you're actually taking it seriously. So, my feeling on deadlines is don't have too many of them, and when you do, it's a P0. So, the engineer is working on it. They don't get to work on anything else.

(01:10:28):
It's like, "Oh, I need them for this," like nope. Nope. You're not pulling them off of anything. We're doing this. As a PM, your job is to just cut as much scope as possible to make it possible to hit that deadline. Like what are the things actually blocking us from doing it? Because what you want to do is at the moment where you have to make the go, no-go call on whether to ship, you want to be able to actually have a product that you can say yes to. It might not have all the features you had wanted or whatever, and you can say no. You can make that choice, but you want to set yourself up to be in a position where you can actually say yes or no to something, because what often happens is like we want this thing. Well, it's not even close to being done yet, so there's no possible way we can say yes. I can't ship it. It's half broken. It's like, "No, no, no. You want to get to a point where it works. It might not be the product that you want, but it is an actual real product that you can conceivably ship."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):
So, you said that don't have too many deadlines, but when you do, make sure you... Everyone understands these are actual deadlines. When do you decide it's worth having a deadline? Is it like a marketing launch sort of thing? What's worthy of a deadline in your experience?

Nan Yu (01:11:32):
Yeah, it's usually having to do with some kind of external marketing type of exercise that you're try to hit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):
Got it.

Nan Yu (01:11:39):
And I think that that's the other thing that I think. As builders, we can often look at launch dates and stuff like that. It's like, "Oh, who cares if it's a little bit later or we skip this change log," or whatever it is, and I think that that's really a... I don't know. It makes me go crazy when I hear people say that in all honesty. With marketing and communication with customers, you basically have a limited amount of opportunities to do so. A year is 365 days. There are 12 months. Each of those months has about four weeks. There's some rhythm where you get to have 50-ish weeks to say something to your audience once a week, or you get to have 12 months to say something really big or four quarters to say something huge. If you miss one of those opportunities, you don't get it back again. You can't time travel back and say like, "Okay, actually, let's redo first quarter and say this message that we wish we could have gotten into the field."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:35):
That is such a powerful point. I could see the sales marketing, go-to-market element of your job coming out there. I imagine everyone that's in that field's like, "Yes, this is exactly right." Maybe just the last question along this line. So, I love this idea of taking deadlines very seriously when you commit to a deadline. At the same time, as you pointed out, it creates a lot of stress knowing there's a deadline we have to hit. So, one lever you've mentioned is cutting scope. Another is just people spending more time estimating to have more accurate deadlines. You invest in that. How do you think about just for an engineering team to come into a deadline, how much to spend on de-risking and estimating versus just, "Let's just do our best and then we'll cut and adjust"?

Nan Yu (01:13:18):
This might be my hot take, but we do almost no estimating in order to hit deadlines. What we do is we ship as early as we can. The thing we talked about earlier where if by the time that 10% of the time has elapsed, you have a working thing, you can now spend the rest of the time deciding whether or not you want to do another iteration or you want to polish that thing and get it to be a shippable state. So, you're setting up your future self to be able to make that decision. So, none of this is... You can't go into this at the very last moment and say like, "Okay, now, we have to take the deadline seriously." You have to do it from the beginning and commit to the process of going very fast, iterating early, and then putting yourself in a position where you can say yes or no to a product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):
So interesting and so different from the way most companies operate. Nan, this was everything I was hoping it'd be. I think this is going to help a lot of people build much better product, which would be good for the world if more products are like Linear. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nan Yu (01:14:20):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:20):
Okay, let's do it. Okay, first question. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Nan Yu (01:14:29):
I think the one book that I recommend the most is The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. I read it originally in college for an HCI class I was taking, and I think of everything I've ever read, it's the thing that caused me to see the world from the perspective of everything you interact with as a product. Every pencil that you use, every door that you open is a product that somebody designed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):
And is that the big takeaway from that book? Because it comes up a lot, and it's such an old book. So, I guess for someone that hasn't read or maybe doesn't have time to read, it is the big takeaway for you. Someone designed everything and there's a reason things aren't great, and they can be improved.

Nan Yu (01:15:10):
Yeah. I mean, I saw this the other day. I was at a café in my neighborhood, and I saw a kid rip a handle off a door, like of the café. He pulled it so hard, it came right off because it was a push door, but it had a handle that looked like you could pull it, and that's one of the canonical examples of the book because [inaudible 01:15:25] are just mysteries. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Awesome. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Nan Yu (01:15:33):
I watched The Diplomat on Netflix. I think it was terrific. It's really fun, easy watch. It has some West Wing vibes if you were into that back in the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:44):
Yeah, have you seen the second season?

Nan Yu (01:15:46):
Yeah, I finished the second season. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
I wasn't as excited about the second season, just to put that out there. The first season was really good and then just went off a little like, "Okay. I guess it's cool," but stuff like that.

Nan Yu (01:15:55):
Yeah, it got a little like spy thrillery, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):
Okay, cool, but still really good and on Netflix. Okay, cool. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Nan Yu (01:16:06):
I didn't discover it, but I discovered a version of it that was really interesting. There's a pen. Actually, I have one on my desk. It's called the Sakura Micron. I don't know if you use these. It's like a felt tip pen. It's really great. It was originally invented in Japan for artists to draw comic books and stuff, and you can use it for anything. I use it for journaling or whatever, but I was on Amazon. I was trying to buy more, and I found a package that said like, "Bible Study Kit." I was like, "Why is this labeled Bible Study Kit?" And it was literally just the pen in four different colors, and it was because the thing doesn't bleed through pages. So, if you have a Bible, which they often have these really flimsy newsprint pages. It's not going to bleed through.

(01:16:51):
And it's just really interesting to me that someone marketed a normal package of these pens as a Bible study kit and for people who were looking for that keyword, and it was official, too. It was not something hacked together. It was actually an official packaging of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):
Amazing. What a unique pen choice. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Nan Yu (01:17:15):
The correct amount is too much minus one, and I think this ties into the try the extreme version of it of a thing where... I don't know, like a stupid example, like how much pizza do you want to eat? It's like, well, five slices was too many. I feel bad. Then four was probably the right number, and then if you want to find the right number, sometimes you just have to really shoot for the edge and then find out what's too much, and then you'll find out exactly what the right amount is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:41):
I love how tactical that is, makes me think about Elon Musk's thing about cutting things. Like one of his formulas for just getting stuff done, one of them is just cut stuff before trying to optimize it and automate it, and his advice is if you don't bring back 10% of things, you cut, you're not cutting enough.

Nan Yu (01:17:59):
Yeah, exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):
Final question. You worked at Everlane for a number of years, and you shared the rough idea of a story around a shirt, maybe a bestseller that they have now, and how you helped create a bestselling women's shirt. Can you share that story?

Nan Yu (01:18:19):
Yeah. So, I mean, to be clear, I witnessed the creation. I don't think I had a direct hand in it, but yeah. So, I saw this advertisement the other day on Instagram for... It's called the Women's Box-Cut Tee, and it's a wide and short for women, and I looked, and it had 20 colors of it, and it sells super well, and I remember when we created this thing, and it was because there was a batch of defective men's t-shirts. They all came in an inch and a half too short. So, we couldn't sell them. You would have your belly button sticking out. No one wants to wear of that. So, what we did was like, well, we have to salvage the inventory because we were a very small company, and we had to make cash flow, and we couldn't just damage it out.

(01:19:06):
So, the design team and the marketing team came together, and they said, "Okay. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to cut another two inches off of this and make it really cropped and market it towards women as like a cropped boxed-tee silhouette, and we did that. We're like, "Okay, hopefully, we can salvage this inventory and not have to take a write-down." It sold out in a week, and we're like, "Oh, okay. I guess we just made a hit product," and it's one of these things where it's very hard to know what this was. Was this a marketing thing? Was this a design thing? I don't know, but you just come together, and you find the right product market fit in the weirdest way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:43):
I love that it's still going.

Nan Yu (01:19:43):
Yeah, it's still going. Originally, it was just white. Now, there's like 20 colors.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:48):
Oh, man. I love how many industries you have worked in: fashion, data analytics, project management. I don't know what's next. There's more, I imagine. Nan, this was incredible. I really appreciate making time for this. Like I said, I think we're going to have helped a lot of people build better products. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Nan Yu (01:20:08):
Yeah, I'm on X/Twitter as the thenanyu. It's T-H-E and then my name, and if they have any feedback about Linear, we're very happy to take it, especially for people who use it in their day-to-day. We really want to hear from users.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
What's the best way for them to share that? Is it tweet at you? Is it go to the website? What do you recommend?

Nan Yu (01:20:31):
Oh, yeah. You can tweet at us. You can DM me on Twitter. My DMs are open, so it's all good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
Amazing. Nan, thank you so much for being here. 

Nan Yu (01:20:39):
Yeah, of course. Thanks, Lenny.

## Transcript

Nancy Duarte (00:00:00):
A lot of people think that the only time you really need to present well is when you have a big stage talk and you make the big investment in the script. The big investment in the contrasting story. I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, like literally it works. It works in any format.

Lenny (00:00:29):

Nancy Duarte (00:03:31):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:33):
How many presentations have you helped craft at this point, both directly and indirectly?

Nancy Duarte (00:03:38):
That's a great question. People know I'll like take a swag at data and pretend it's real. So, I had a president who took us a whack at that number in, it was 2014, and he said at that time it was 225,000, and that was almost 10 years ago, so I can't even tell you, I mean we stopped tracking, but it's a lot. I mean, in 35 years we have thousands of projects we open and each sometimes has two to a hundred presentations in it, so it'd be hard to tell.

Lenny (00:04:13):
200,000.

Nancy Duarte (00:04:15):
He said 250,000, but that was 10 years ago and I didn't do the math. So, when my team questioned it, I'm like, oh, Dan did the math. They're like, "Oh, then it's accurate." Because they thought I was just making up this number. I'm like, no, no, we actually went in and looked.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Okay. I was not expecting it to be that large. That's insane.

Nancy Duarte (00:04:34):
It's so funny because I have the whole history of the Silicon Valley in a way. It's like every little startup and then they grew to massive brands like Cisco and you could actually look at the rise and fall of all these companies. And then I actually have all the decks. I still have a lot of these archives, so I could actually verify that number exactly.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Okay, well this next question's going to be extra hard then. Of all the presentations you've worked on, which one stands out to you as the most memorable or most impactful?

Nancy Duarte (00:05:02):
I mean, it has to be Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth. It kind of hit the world in a season where nobody really knew or had an example of a really well done presentation. So, it came out before TED Talks were even out on the web, and so people had never seen someone tell a data story and stand in front of data and the scale in 90 foot screen, but we had worked with him for five years before an Inconvenient Truth. People think he went from vice president to this presenter and I didn't work with him. I let my team work with him. So, they were the ones jetting around jumping backstage at Oprah. They loved it. It was a real peak season.

(00:05:40):
But the thing actually that was most memorable is we work with these 20 some year old CEOs here in the Valley and they tend to show up and act like they know better than someone who's been doing this for so long. And what was so interesting about this large figure politician communicator is the team would sit in a room and say, "Hey, we think you need to do this way. We think you needed to convey it this way. We think it should be visualized this way." Or whatever it was we were proposing. And he would literally pause and touch his chin and really think, and really consider that we might actually be experts.

(00:06:18):
And more times than not he would adopt the way we said it should be done. And so I think as the customer who actually probably had some of the most power in the whole world to thoughtfully defer to us as experts was delightful customer and consulting experience. I mean, I remember when they called me to say it was going to become a movie and that it had gotten funded and I started to get the information. They wanted us to do a lot of work to get it movie ready. And I'll never forget, I said, "Wow, that's going to be a lot of work we'd have to do for free, and who's going to go see a movie about a slideshow anyway?" That's literally what I said. So, yeah, I just didn't believe it would become what it became. So, the whole process was amazing.

Lenny (00:07:05):
Did you expect the impact of what happened after that presentation or was it just like, oh, we got this one job we got to do, let's just get through it and then move on?

Nancy Duarte (00:07:14):
Well, we've been doing it for five years. I think the strategy, whether it was intentional or not, I don't know. So, he would go city to city to city, because he was traveling for five years seeding, like planting seeds for a groundswell, and he went into, he would go to the Stanford campus invite the Bay Area Elite, and it was always private and it was always VIP. And so he did a really good job for five years, traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling and really delivering that talk. And I think that created a desire. I don't know that it would've gotten that much traction. I don't know if people already didn't know about the presentation and hadn't already seen the presentation and they brought their friends to the movie, is how I kind of picture at least that part happening.

(00:07:59):
And he was generous, Lenny. I mean, at the end, when he traveled around for those five years at the end, he always had a slide with our name on it and would thank us if you're in the audience. I mean, super, and paid, mostly paid for what we did that we did give a lot of our own time. But yeah, super generous and yeah, movie became what it was. It was a bit of a surprise. It was good. The movie was good.

Lenny (00:08:24):
It was good. It also makes me think about a pattern that I often see of it wasn't just one presentation that changed everything. It was, you said five years of prep ahead of that, and you always see these wow overnight success stories and you always find, okay, it wasn't actually that.

Nancy Duarte (00:08:42):
Yeah, and he did a good job after, once it got traction, we built a whole training program where he could fly people out to his place in Tennessee and start to train people. So, it almost became a train the trainer and he could sanction you as a ambassador for it. So, it was just the way the whole thing kind of unfolded and scaled and then got traction was lovely.

Lenny (00:09:03):
Speaking of impressive clients, I only learned this recently, but Apple has been a client of yours since the day you were founded as an organization. Is that right?

Nancy Duarte (00:09:12):
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Okay. How did you land that initially? And then also just what have you learned from that experience that's informed your approach to presentation, design, communication, and how you work with clients?

Nancy Duarte (00:09:22):
I love that question. So, yeah, I had a real job. I was working my real job and my husband had bought a Mac and he's like, "I think this is a business. I think it could be a real business." And he was an illustrator, wasn't a designer, but he had been a fine artist. And he's like, "Look, I can draw." Of course it's all pixelated and bit mappy. He goes, "Look, I could draw lines in here." And if I could show you his art studio, his work is just gorgeous. So, he's definitely a fine artist. And he's like, "I think this is a business. I think this could be a business." And I'm very pregnant. We were talking about that earlier. I am very pregnant with my son and I'm like, "Dude, you're going to go get yourself a real job. I don't want you playing around with this little Mac thing."

(00:10:02):
And he begged me twice in our marriage. He literally has gotten on his knees and to try to get me to see his perspective begged me. He's like, "Just read a Mac World magazine, just read it through once, and if you still don't think this could become a thing ..." Because I was working on a mainframe, I'm like, I work on a real computer. So, what happened was I made some phone calls. I called NASA and I called Tandem, which is now HP, and I called Apple and we won contracts at all three brands at the same time. And back then our company was called Duarte Desktop Publishing and Graphic Design.

Lenny (00:10:36):
Oh, wow.

Nancy Duarte (00:10:37):
I know, I know. And we slipped in. When you talk about a product lifecycle, very early, everything was still bit mappy, was not attractive. Most people as users didn't know how to typeset, didn't know how to do columns, didn't know how to make in this tool at all. And there's about an 18 month window in the life cycle of the Macintosh where graphic designers refused to use it, refused. It's a toy, it's ugly, it's bit mapped. Nobody would do it, a font like that. We use Linotype. It was very, the snobby kind of, we won't touch it. And that's right when we entered right then went and checked out books at the library on type setting, we tried to figure out what we could do, what could we do with this tool, and then the rest was kind of history. And so that's how it started and the timing and just kind of pushing the tool that nobody was that interested in that we're in the design community. It was small adoption.

Lenny (00:11:36):
So, that's interesting that it was cold emails basically are cold reach out just like, "Hey, we want to work with you." Yeah, that's an awesome [inaudible 00:11:42]-

Nancy Duarte (00:11:42):
Cold calling. Cold calling, yeah, it was.

Lenny (00:11:45):
What did you take away from that experience that kind of informed what works and doesn't work in presentations?

Nancy Duarte (00:11:51):
Presentations used to be 35 millimeter slides in an old carousel. In fact, that's what Al Gore had when he showed, he was like, here's my slide carousel from the seventies. It was just how it was done. But Apple was the first company to hook up the computer to a projector at scale. Now the projectors at these big venues like San Jose Convention Center, I mean it was huge and it was risky. So, because we were first in, they pushed us to start to do the presentations in this tool and it was black and white. Everything was black and white when we first started. And then we started to push and push and push from how we illustrated things in the tool, how we would colorize clip art. I mean, I'm talking like clip art packages just came out and they're like, "Hey, grab these, colorize them."

(00:12:32):
And so it was a really momentous moment to win them as an account. And I remember the tool had started to really take off and it was ugly. You can call it fugly, I don't know what you want to call it, but everyone who made slides did it so poorly, just so poorly. And we were kind of pushing the boundaries of it to make it look attractive. And there was a sales conference in 1992 in San Francisco and the leader of sales at the time was kind of a creative savant of sorts. And I remember he's like, "I don't know how you're going to do it, but I want you to take the whole slide." This is when slides were basically teleprompted covered in text. If you could stick a piece of clip art on it, you were lucky. And he said, "I want you to just make the whole slide, it's just covered with the word big in hot pink. And I want the background black, because when this slide pops up in all pink big, I want it to actually light the faces of the people in the audience."

(00:13:26):
And it was like I didn't know how to, we couldn't do that. We had to go into free hand, convert it to this, do these six steps, and then we came up with a small JPEG at the time or png or something and we scaled it up. So, it was still kind of pixelated. And I remember I was in that hall during the rehearsal and the production team gasped. Couple people squealed. They're like, "Who did this? I mean, it was just the word big in magenta pink." And I just remember thinking, this is how it's supposed to be done. Putting the tool in the hands of the masses kind of destroyed the medium itself.

(00:13:58):
And I feel like the first 10 or so years I was in business, it was reshaping this medium that ran amuck when it got into the hands of the users, it just went completely the opposite way that it was supposed to. So, it's weird to say that was a real defining moment for me to say, wait, we can do this different and we can return to how they used to be done when they were 35 millimeter slides. So, that's one story. And then I think we're very good at mapping to the brand requirements. So, we take this tool, whatever the tool, we have all our brands use different ones. They use Slides, Keynote, they use PowerPoint. We use whatever tool the brand wants and we push it in each medium. But we take their brand guidelines and really push it into the spoken word medium where when they stand up on a stage, it's cinematic. The visuals can become an experience in itself.

(00:14:57):
And I remember when Apple came up with the Think Different campaign. Steve Jobs was just back and my designer, everyone Photoshop was new. And everyone's doing these beveled backgrounds with tons of crap on the background. And I walked by, I'm like, "No, oh, we can't have a blue frame looking photo frame to for the Think Different campaign. This is not going to work." And so I remember looking at all the posters and remembering the Alfred Hitchcock ones. It had these particulates like these particulates, and it was just shadows.

(00:15:34):
And I found a stock video that Adobe had made at the time, and it was just particulates floating through the air at the angle and we stuck the six color apple on top of it. That was so revolutionary back there to push the brand and get out of the way every, the whole world was making these hideous templates. So, there are these moments that pushed the company forward because of an idea that I knew would not be okay for the Apple brand, therefore it shouldn't be okay for any brand. And I think those are just a couple stories of how to really push the medium in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. The audience just likes it better when it's really clear what you're supposed to focus on. We love that brand. We love it.

Lenny (00:16:22):
Okay, so let's get a little tactical, because you're talking about some very specific things that you've found to be working. So, everyone listening to this podcast has probably heard many times it's really important to be great at presentations that there's so much power in storytelling and communication, all these things. And they probably read a bunch of books and blog posts and watch videos of how to give a great presentation. But myself, and I feel like most people sit down at a deck when they're about to present to an all hand, say a week later or are going to do a meeting. And I'm always just like, okay, what do I do? Okay, there's like a beginning, middle end, they should have some kind of problem. And it's always like, I don't know what I'm doing. So, if someone were to just be listening to this podcast and they're like, I'm going to write a post-it to myself of three bullet points of things that I should remember when I'm starting a deck, what are those three bullet points?

Nancy Duarte (00:17:11):
Your audience is the hero. That was in my TED talk from 2011. I would say it's infuse your talk with story. And I would say it is asking yourself, can they see what I'm saying? Those would be the three tips other than starting with empathy. I mean that that's, well, audience is the hero, is the empathy centric approach.

Lenny (00:17:33):
Let's dive into these then. And I was actually going to ask around empathy, and it feels like that comes up a lot in your recommendations to people's empathy is kind of the heart of your methodology of telling great stories, telling great presentations. So, let's spend a little time there. Why is that so important and what does that actually look like in practice?

Nancy Duarte (00:17:50):
Empathy is important to Duarte, everything we do is empathy first. And some of it comes from my own childhood story a little bit. I was raised by a clinically narcissistic mom and narcissist are missing the empathy gene. So, I feel like that void of not having it modeled for me is why I keep clawing at empathy as being important. And I think a lot of people listening might work for a boss that does not have empathy, that isn't other centric, that doesn't think before they talk and all of those things. And I was raised by someone like that. And so every single book and every single model that I ever make has empathy at the core because you have to have to think about who am I speaking with, especially in communication, who am I speaking with? And so when I went on my journey through storytelling, I figured out that I thought, okay, the presenter's the hero, for sure the presenter's the hero, they're the central figure. They're talking the most. They're well lit, they're up on a stage.

(00:18:48):
So, when I started to look at all the archetypes, that's where I landed. And then I was like, oh my god. When I got to really digging into the mentor, I realized it's really the mentor in myths and movies that's the presenter and who really holds the power in the room of a presentation is the audience, the audience gets to make a choice if they accept or reject your idea. So, the balance of power is with them and not you. So, it really is the role of the presenter to be the mentor. And in myths and movies, the mentor comes alongside the hero. In other words, the presenter should come alongside the audience and help them get unstuck or bring a magical tool. So, I think Obi Won Kenobi's a great example.

(00:19:32):
He did two things for Luke Skywalker. He gave him a light saber, which was for his outer journey, the physical journey he was doing, and then an inner tool, which was the resolve, which came to him through the force. So, when you're speaking to an audience, they're going to have an internal conflict that you have to give them something to soothe. And then you're asking them to therefore go and do this thing, take this action, do this call to action. That's asking them to physically do something or physically change in some way. So, they're not going to do that for you if you haven't empathetically thought about how hard what you're asking them is going to be for them to do. And so you have to change your mindset when you're starting to build your deck to think about who am I talking to? How am I going to help them get unstuck? And that's just a super foundational principle in everything we do.

Lenny (00:20:29):
What is an example of that in practice as we go through these? Because this is really great of that implemented the deck that we know about maybe?

Nancy Duarte (00:20:38):
Oh, that we know about. So, I could talk about our own internal ones. Most of what we do is under MSAs because they're fantastical brands. So, in my own company, before I do a presentation that's going to require goals or them reaching goals or we do an annual vision talk, we do a listening tour first. So, some of it's based in survey, some of it's based in interviews. And we feed that information up and then we compare it to what we're going to ask them to do. And we do some gap analysis. We literally, there's some actual questions you can ask yourself, which are somewhat classic design thinking kind of questions about where they're at. And then what we do is I create a real rough cut or the exec team creates a real rough cut and then we invite the next level of leaders in and we do a fake, I mean the slides are ugly, we don't spend time on the slides.

(00:21:31):
This is about the message and maybe a model or two or three that we're going to go through to feel like it may amplify or make the message more concrete. And then they get feedback and that's when it's hard. It's hard to go from rough cut, here's what we're going to say to making it absolutely resonate. And then we deliver it after all of that work has been done, then we share it to the company. So, we go through that knowing that's the hardest presentation I deliver all year. I used to travel and speak and be a public speaker, but it's my own internal ones I have to take more time with.

(00:22:05):
So, when I travel and speak, they're like, oh my God, I love your models. Oh my gosh, can I get a picture with you? But when I'm standing in front of my own team, they're like, I wonder what she's going to say, because she's about to either make my job harder or she's going to change my priorities. They come in more skeptical. And we definitely have nailed the annual kickoff meeting. Definitely have nailed that. And then we do quarterly updates to that annual kickoff meeting. And it's a cadence and people get enthused and we're kind of killing it right now.

Lenny (00:22:40):
Yeah, that's what it feels like from the outside. I'm just thinking about the pressure to create presentations within Duarte Design. If you think about your job as hard, creating a deck for your company, imagine that.

Nancy Duarte (00:22:52):
Presentations in front of presentation experts is like-

Lenny (00:22:55):
Oh my god.

Nancy Duarte (00:22:56):
And I get nervous. I get really nervous because I have one slide that's kind of flawed or I say um or I pace too much. You lose a third of your team each time. They're such experts. So, it's hard.

Lenny (00:23:10):
I want to walk through these three bullet points. So, the first is make the listener the hero of your story. And that comes from being empathetic and understanding their challenge. So, if you're trying to do that, what are signs that you're doing it well or not well? Is there the way the flow of the story start? Is it the here's the way it starts? Or what should people identify of I'm doing this well or I'm not doing this well?

Nancy Duarte (00:23:31):
If the audience is the hero, you would see visible signs that they get it. People would come before I did a really good talk and people were tweeting saying, "Hey, come to this talk. It's really good." So, you'd see a reaction. You know you've done it well if you're infusing your talk with story, which is the second bullet by utilizing story structures. So, when I say storytelling, I'm talking about an anecdote. When I say story structures, I'm talking about this format of a three act structure of storytelling that goes back tens of thousands of years, which is fused into the brain like FMRI machines now you can see them while a story's being told and the science is beautiful, if you're telling me a story and I'm listening, our brains are firing in the exact same order, in the exact same place. So, it has power to align our brains.

(00:24:26):
And so by implementing attributes of story like a beginning, a middle, and an end, and we have method for that. And in also incorporating the rise and fall story kind of builds tension and releases it. And that's why we love it so much is we escape through someone else's messy middle and conflict and problems like it's messy and then it resolves. You build the tension and resolve it. And that's what a really well structured presentation can do. It can pull on that rise and fall in a way that creates longing.

(00:24:58):
So, story creates longing. It helps people long for something they'd never wanted before because if the future is told in the shape of a story and they see this alternate future, so many people escape through sci-fi. They escape through movie making into these future worlds. And so picture that you could verbally paint a picture of this future state and then you could bring your whole audience to this future state in an amazing way using this cadence of rise and fall. That's how you can incorporate story into a presentation where you need to influence others, actually really can be beautiful when it's done well.

Lenny (00:25:38):
And so you gave a TEDx Talk on this exact topic. And so I want to go deeper here. And you kind of shared this very visual way of thinking about a great story where it kind of goes up and down and up and down these teeth almost. Can you actually talk about-

Nancy Duarte (00:25:51):
[inaudible 00:25:51] pumpkin teeth. Yeah, it does.

Lenny (00:25:54):
Can you share what that structure visually looks like? And we'll share a link in the show notes of what that actually looks like and then just why that is so impactful and important.

Nancy Duarte (00:26:02):
Yeah, I love that. So, I went on a three year journey through story and I knew that the greatest speeches overall time did have that rise and fall and rise and fall. But it wasn't one single story. It had a whole lot of other very important information, but it still did this rise and fall and risen fall. So, I am not a digital native. I took a quarter inch graph paper and I would listen to all kinds and map out, took the words. When I analyzed Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech, I did it all by hand. I wrote every word I did quarter inch graph paper. I needed to know, I needed to see it the way I work, which was analog. And so at first it was zigzaggy and I realized, wait, you can't map something over time and have it be a zigzag.

(00:26:49):
There was too much data lost. So, to verbally describe it, you could picture a line at the bottom of your screen and that line going left to is what is. And you need to set up every talk by stating what is. And then it moves straight up and you move to what could be come back down to the bottom line again say what is, back up, what could be, what is, what could be, what is, what could be? And then at the last what could be you state the last horizontal line is what we call the new bliss. So, this motion of traversing between what is, what could be, what's is, what could be, what is, what could be, that sense of longing for the future, it makes people leave their current state or the status quo or our current reality and makes them long for this future state by using contrast.

(00:27:37):
So, that rise and fall of hey, here's our current problem, here's a solution, or here's the state of the union. But we imagine it could look like this. There's so many different ways to build that cadence of contrast that's so lovely. I mean it really works. I think the talk came out in 2011 and the amounts of notes and emails of things people have accomplished by changing the structure of their presentation has been really astounding.

Lenny (00:28:09):
The State of the Union is a really interesting example because I'm trying to imagine this and presentations I've seen and that totally resonates of just like, here's the problem we're having and here's where we're going to go. Here's another problem we're having. Here's what I'm going to change.

Nancy Duarte (00:28:20):
Steve Jobs was great at that. When he launched the iPhone speech, he always did, here's the state of the company, here's how we're doing. Oh my God, our stores are more full than 10 Mac world expos. He always did a setup of what was going on. And then he did a really rapid what is, what could be when he started to compare the iPhone to the Blackberry. It's like, look how much it sucks now that you've seen what we're doing. It's just what is, what could be, what is, what could be. And so I took all the classic speeches, historical speeches, everything, presidential speeches and knew that if I could find a pattern in Dr. King and Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech that was the same, that had the same type of nature of cadence and pulsing to it, for lack of a better word, that I knew I had solved it using story. It was a really great moment to finally draw that out on my quarter inch graph paper.

Lenny (00:29:19):
I love that.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:19):
It was awesome.

Lenny (00:29:22):
I feel like there's just so much opportunity for primary research that still I feel like that's why my newsletter does well is I just spent the time doing that work that you're describing of watching a thousand interviews and then just distilling, here's a takeaway here.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:34):
Pattern finding, that's an interesting point. I worry sometimes with the emergence of new technologies and stuff, the ability to be able to sit and think, synthesize and all of that is because a human's going to come up with different insights and synthesis than any future machine can do. So, I think it's fascinating that you do that so well and it really shows that.

Lenny (00:29:34):
Wow, I appreciate that.

Nancy Duarte (00:29:59):
Yeah, you're really putting your mind and heart into it all.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Enough about me, I'm thinking about, but I appreciate it, I'm thinking about product managers and founders maybe listening to this and they're like, oh man, every time I do a deck, I need to create this whole story and this up and down thing. In your experience, when do you go that far to create? Is this when you have an epic important presentation, you think about a story structure like this, or is there always a way you should put this into your presentations of some kind of story with this contrast?

Nancy Duarte (00:30:31):
It's interesting question. I think a lot of people think that the only time you really need to present well is when you have a big stage talk and you make the big investment in the script, the big investment in the contrasting story. But I'll tell you a dirty little secret. I can get my husband to do chores for me on the weekends with a real quick, what is, what could be new bliss, kind of just that first bit, what is, what could be new bliss. It's like even the very, very short talk that Abraham Lincoln gave in the Gettysburg address, it was basically a funeral, it was a eulogy. And back then eulogies used to be two hours long. It was an Aristotelian structure and he only had a couple hundred words, so there's no pictures of him giving it because it was so short, so tight and done.

(00:31:16):
They were setting up the cameras, still thinking they had tons of time. So, the ability to just have that contrast as a framework in your brain during a meeting, on a phone call, any moment of influence, getting the husband to do some chores for me, literally it works. It works in any format. And I think the investment that you make in the longer form or when it's a huge audience, you add the visuals, you really hire the speaker coaches, you really make that moment. And there's these moments that breach above all other moments where you really have to nail it just in basic conversations, in a moment of influence. If you practice it enough, it'll live in your head as a mental model for when you're in a situation where there's influence in the air that you could do.

Lenny (00:32:07):
How do you actually do it with your husband if you could share for helping you do the dishes?

Nancy Duarte (00:32:11):
Well, I won't get graphic about what the new bliss might be, but early in our marriage we figured out that, not early, I actually spent almost in the only the last 10 years we've been married for 40. And we realized that when we tangle it's usually only about process. So, the gaps are if I ask or he asks me to do something or we start to kind of pick on each other, it's because the way I'm executing something is different than the way he chose to execute it. And so it'll be anything from like, "Why are you chopping onions like that?" He'll say to me. And now I'm like, oh, we have a process gap. "Do you want to chop the onions or do you want me to chop them my way?" So, for the what is, what could be new bliss, it happens all the time.

(00:32:59):
So, he needs a lot of context. He's a detail-oriented person and I've started to learn with him that my what is needs to be quite a bit longer than sometimes I have patience for as I start to frame, "Oh hey baby, I need you to take the dog over to the dog care." I don't start there. I start with, "Oh my gosh, tomorrow I've got back to back meetings, in fact, I'm going to be on Lenny's Podcast right about here. And that's when she's whiny. And what's going to happen is if that doesn't happen, I'm going to have to reschedule next week and next week it's just loaded up. And you know how it is when I'm stressed out at the end of the day and I'm kind of hard to deal with and I say, well, what could be, the doggy place, she was loved it last time she was spooning with a red cavalier king spaniel and loved it."

(00:33:46):
It's like that, I have to unpack it a little bit more for him. And then the new bliss could be any sort of marital promise you want it to be, but I just have to unpack the current state a little bit of the process, and then I state what could be. And it's funny because acts of service like that, like him taking the dog to the doggy daycare for me or is I feel loved. So, when someone does something generous with their time for me, it's how I feel loved. And so there's a whole lot there in shaping how you communicate with someone. Empathetically at my company, everyone knows each other's love language. They know that this person feels more appreciated when they get a written note. This person feels more appreciated when they get a gift and everyone knows that. So, that's just baked into our, I don't know, our marriage, our company, just how it rolls.

Lenny (00:34:43):
I imagine people listening to this podcast were not expecting marriage advice. And so I love that. I'm going to try.

Nancy Duarte (00:34:50):
You can scrap that if it doesn't work the process tip though is good.

Lenny (00:34:52):
This is going to be the best part. This is going to be the whole podcast is just the segment. Just joking. But this is really good advice. I'm going to try to use it myself. So, the structure, I think it's even easier to think about this less as story, infused story. For me it's more this, what is, what could be, what is the ideal bliss, that's almost the simpler way to think about it. The story is this like, oh my God, I got to think of a story.

Nancy Duarte (00:35:17):
It has a beginning, middle, and an end. So, the first, what is is the beginning. The middle is the messy middle. That's where you're trying to contrast and show them that it's messy. It might be hard, it's worth it. And then the new bliss, you end with what in western cultures, where's like a happy ending. So, the new bliss is just imagine a world with your idea adopted, and then you paint a picture of that world poetically or pragmatically, and it works. It definitely works.

Lenny (00:35:41):
Okay, this is really great. So, just to recap, point one is to make your listener the hero of the story and come at it with empathy. And I was actually thinking the Think Different campaign is an excellent example of that because it's about you thinking differently and being this incredible creative. And then item two is infuse your presentation with story and this what is, what could be new bliss. And then, okay, and number three, what was number three again?

Nancy Duarte (00:36:09):
Oh, it was ask yourself if they can see what you're saying. Can they see what I'm saying would be written on the note?

Lenny (00:36:16):
I love this. Okay, let's talk about that. What does that mean and how do you do that?

Nancy Duarte (00:36:20):
Yeah, so for people to see what you're saying, that you have an opportunity to use visual tools like the presentation software, you have opportunities to have live sketchers sketch it while you're talking. There's so many ways you can help people see what you're saying. I would contend that you can use something in your talk that gives people something they'll always remember. We call that a star moment. And it could be a piece of dramatic data where the big numbers put up there. It could be an evocative story, it could be a beautiful picture. And one of the things that happens really well, especially with tech companies, is demonstrating through a picture so you can get alignment. So, the concept of a diagram when you describe your product that you're working on, is this thing inside of it, outside of it attached to it, is it on it is above it, especially architecture slides or just how technology works as something flows through a complex system.

(00:37:20):
When people can see that and it accompanies your verbal narrative, they can actually understand what you're conveying and move on. If you only had a verbal narrative, it wouldn't work as well. There's a lot of times though, where you don't have the support of a presentation or slides. You could be at a dinner table. If you're in a interesting conversation and you want someone to see what you're saying, that's where you pull out the napkin and you draw it. So, you could both see it, in meetings sometimes someone will just walk right up to the board and draw something. And my team, especially my design team is so good at this because they'll just stand up and say, I want to draw for you what I see, because we're about to prepare them to present to an audience. When you verbally said that, I saw this, was that your intent?

(00:38:03):
And then the room will stand up and we'll start all co-creating a graphic so that everyone sees the exact same thing, the exact same steps, the exact same insights in the order. So, nobody leaves with a question in their mind. And that's just so important for there to be an alignment around what is this? What are we all fighting for? What are we all living for? What are we all working for? And those moments of alignment are so, so important. And I'm a leader who sees things in the air. I just see it. And to me, my pattern finding nature, which you're like that too. I could see these patterns and to me, I see a whole scene and I could see it all clearly, but when my team's trying to look at the same thing, they might see 22 mosaic tiles out of a massive mosaic beautiful picture.

(00:38:53):
I see the final beautiful picture, but I've only served up a little tiny mosaic tile in a few places. And so I even have to be better about really bringing it to earth and saying, oh, here's the seven steps to get to this amazing outcome. Sometimes we see things so plainly in our mind's eye, and I was working with a really famous, powerful CEO and as she was talking, it's like, yeah, I could see her. I was watching her hand motions too, and she was like in this thing and she's moving her arms around in a distinct way and I said, I can tell you you have a picture in your mind's eye.

(00:39:31):
Let me draw for what I, and I did the same thing, walked up, drew had this, had this, had this. And she's like, "Exactly." And we were brought in because nobody could articulate at all what she saw in her mind's eye. And so that was a massive program to be rolled out to the entire retail. It was like a hundred thousand retail workers needed to understand this graphic and the whole process she was trying to roll out wasn't getting traction. So, the minute people could see what she was saying, then it had all the breakthroughs that needed to happen around that program.

Lenny (00:40:04):
That reminds me of when I was working on the super host program at Airbnb. I don't know if the story will be of any interest to anyone, but I just remember I had this very clear handset of motions that described the strategy of the super host program. And then my friend's like, you should draw this on a slide-

Nancy Duarte (00:40:19):
You should draw it. Unless it's such a powerful hand gesture, right? Yeah, you could do that because your body is visual. And the other thing we try to get our customers to do is, if Dr. King had slides that day of the I Have a Dream speech, it just wouldn't been as beautiful. His words painted the pictures in our mind's eye. And so when we can have the slides off so people are focused on the verbal stream and what's coming out of your mouth that is such a powerful moment is to not have any visuals supporting you. So, they're a hundred percent focused on your body, how you're showing up and on the words coming out of your mouth and they're verbally seeing what you're saying versus actually pictorially seeing what you're saying. It's good.

Lenny (00:41:03):
I like the idea that people are not staring at me and I prefer them distracted with a slide and I want to talk about nerves and stuff presenting in a bit. But that's interesting. So, you were talking about very kind of some concrete tips for slides and something I've heard a lot is when you're sharing a deck internally or talking an internal meeting, it's really powerful to just have obviously just a quick image thing, but then also the title of the slide is the point you want them to get from that slide. Is that something you recommend? And then generally any just very tactical advice on how to make a slide effective?

Nancy Duarte (00:41:35):
Yeah, the concept that each slide should make one point. So, your whole presentation should be grounded in what we call the audience journey, which is the big idea where you're trying to move them from where you're trying to move them to. Then a big idea is what is your point of view and what's at stake if they do or do not adopt it? That's the organizing mechanism for your whole deck. And then each slide itself that supports that one big, big idea, each slide itself should make one point in support of that big idea. People can't process too many things at one time, so depending on where you work, some people want something that's not the key insight at the top of the slide, some people do. So, some might want the action to be taken or some might want the dreamy future state to be clear.

(00:42:22):
Some consulting firms where the slides are much denser because they were paid millions of dollars to make a big old deck. Some of them are like, "Oh, it always belongs in the lower right corner." So, it's kind of a little bit up to the brand and everyone believes it belongs somewhere else. If you're making what we call a slide doc, which I think your listenership would be interested in, presentations go from big staged event to in a meeting where you're trying to persuade your peers too. Can I make a presentation I can just circulate on email and everyone gets it? Well, that's called a slide doc. You put more words, you put stronger picture. You could have a hundred page appendix and maybe the front of it's only five slides, but everything they need to see your thinking, it follows behind it.

(00:43:08):
And you could circulate those and people read it. You write full sentences, you write full pros. It's kind of like the six page memo that's so popular to Amazon, but we contend that the F words and pictures, the six page memo is better. So, how do you send a memo around without the help of a presenter? And that's on one extreme. And those are called slide docs that you build in presentation software. And then the other extreme is I'm on a massive stage somewhere and there's all kinds of usage in between. And so I think the one idea per slide is important. And then this guiding principle, don't make a single slide unless it supports the one big idea of your whole talk. That's another principle for slide making, because most people go back to some sort of repository in some data store somewhere and they dig through old crappy slides and see if they can assemble something super quickly.

(00:44:01):
And that's a cop out. Most of the time if you really think empathetically about your audience, going to the repository might get you halfway there, but you should be modifying and mapping all of the content based on who you're talking to and especially if it's high stakes. And sometimes you're speaking to an audience that wants high density slides, because that's how they communicate in their culture. And if you showed up with cinematic stage ready slides, they'd laugh you out of the room. And so you really got to, I mean, you got to know your audience, you got to know how they communicate, who they talk to and map to that.

Lenny (00:44:39):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage.

(00:45:16):
Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basically through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports, test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning plans. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity. What's your take on the Minto Pyramid principle? I don't know if you think about that. Yeah, because there's a recommendation of just start with the conclusion and then explain why. And you're saying sometimes that's effective, sometimes not. Maybe in [inaudible 00:46:00]-

Nancy Duarte (00:45:59):
Sometimes it's effective. So, the Minto principle is amazing. She's got the, was it horizontal and vertical thinking? So, your main segues or your main section head should add up and then all the slides should support it. And then also how the construct of it is and when you state the conclusion first, that's a great thing to do with execs. It's a great thing to do when you are fundraising. There's a certain type of an audience that works for, and there's other audiences where they really need to be taught to long for this future state and you need longer to unpack it. So, one of the reasons you would start with the conclusion is especially in a funding round, now my version of a conclusion or result or is different than how she describes it. Because I would say you start with the new bliss. So, if you're trying to raise funds, you would say, I am going to share with you something today and you share how your solution increases human flourishing.

(00:47:02):
It needs to be tied to the humanness and the big problem you're going to solve and how humankind will benefit. Well, that's different than just a consultant would show up and say, hi, I have this 800 page deck and the results of it are this. Let's unpack it. It's just a completely different motion and we use a three act story structure that's quite a bit different too. But that work is solid and it was based kind of like my work, her work was based in going super deep in McKinsey's thinking over time, whereas my work is going laterally across the 35 highest performing brands in the world that have been our customers. So, I went laterally across all those brands and then come up with solutions that are based, foreign story and are based in a bit of a broader application across companies that I have tons of respect for that body of work.

Lenny (00:47:57):
Awesome. And willing to, I wrote a post about this whole concept for folks that want to dig deeper. Maybe one more question around tactical slide stuff, and I know this is, people ask you about this stuff all the time, but I can't help it. I guess just any other tips for just like you're sitting there trying to create a couple slides. What else maybe people should keep in mind to make it effective and let's say this is for a small meeting kind of thing.

Nancy Duarte (00:48:18):
Yeah, that's a good question. I think that if do some thinking first, if it's important, if it's an important point of the meeting, my team is taught to just kind of sketch, change your environment up a little bit. A lot of people will fire up the deck, which is very linear. It's like make one slide, second slide, third slide. So, just think and plan for a minute. And we tend to draw up storyboards. It's like, okay, the first point, the second point, the third point or the just think first. It can be analog or digital. Put a page in front of all your decks. It's just boxes. Just get the narrative right. And then when you actually open up the software, that's where you have to think about, what's the slide type that will convey this the most? Is it a table? Put a table. Especially for program managers, you have to convey dense project information, program information, product information, and that comes with density.

(00:49:12):
So, if you're in a room with your peers and everyone in the room is a team and everyone has their own shorthanded and way of working, put that common slide up there. That common slide for that team might be dense to the outside world, but everyone's used to using it so there's no harm in using a commonly known, commonly acceptable framework or slide or table or Excel spreadsheet because you're aligning around a process. And so don't feel like every needs like cinematic pictures of kittens because that's not going to get you anywhere. You're trying to move an objective along, and that does mean that your slides might be more dense and sometimes internal slides have a lot more important information that needs to be on it to kick a product along or kick a process along.

Lenny (00:50:00):
You were just talking about process and that is a great segue to a question I wanted to ask is just what does your process look like when you're working with a company to help them craft an awesome presentation?

Nancy Duarte (00:50:10):
Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because I don't have to do this much anymore. I haven't done it for about 15 years, which is nice. I have a gorgeous team of strategist, writers, conceptual thinkers, beautiful design.

Lenny (00:50:22):
I was curious.

Nancy Duarte (00:50:24):
Coaches. Yeah, I know. I get coached. It's fun. I definitely, my books look awesome, not because of me, but because I'm followed around by people that do really gorgeous work. But the phrase that we use internally and sometimes with customers is we make presentations the way Pixar makes movies. And that's very similar to the way we get somebody that has this high stakes moment where it's a big deal in this moment. You have to win in the moment to push things along. And so we do, we literally craft a narrative, craft the big idea, craft the script and visualize certain moments. We start to map it out, we start to chunk it out.

(00:51:05):
And then big models sometimes when you're really making a revolutionary model, one that could drive all the web assets, a lot of that stuff people don't realize actually happens in the presentation first as an idea. So, sometimes we'll start working on some of the key models right away too, and we start to circulate that around the company, because everyone has to build consensus around it. So, sometimes there's multiple motions happening at the same time. Let's sketch this. You go away, you work with this department, you try to get this settled, you get that set, you get this.

(00:51:36):
And then it gets reassembled at the end. And then the narrative is where you work all the kinks out and then when they stand and deliver, it's like, yes, it's the voice track that all the process supported. And then other times we're building a report in a slide doc, or there was a time where we had a head of a multinational company that will remain nameless and the guy that was head of all of India was going to come over here and petition the CEO for a hundred million dollar budget.

(00:52:09):
It's not trivial. And he comes, is like, "Okay, I need your help with these five slides." And he just sends us the five slides and we're like, "Well yeah, a hundred million. That's kind of a lot. You really want to put technology between you and the CEO. Do you really want to sit side by side and both be looking at a computer in this moment where it's like you're petitioning him for, that's a lot of money." And he's like, "Yeah, you're right." So, what we did is we made a mental model he could hold up in his head and the structure was so simple and clear. And then there was three moments where we're like just, I don't know, just grab a piece of paper or go to a whiteboard and just start to draw in front of him. Let him see your eyes, let him have eye contact.

(00:52:46):
Let him see your passion. Don't be dispassionately looking at this computer. And he did it and he called us and he's like, "I got a hundred million bucks." So, it's just those moments where you have to realize, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do I need a deck? Who am I talking to? And should is this a cookie cutter thing? And does the same process work every time? No. So, every time we solve something it's very different and we try to make it unique to the presenter and the audience that they're speaking to.

Lenny (00:53:18):
Along the same lines, a lot of presentations now are actually remote and on Zoom and virtual. What do you recommend to people in terms of how they present and put presentations together being remote?

Nancy Duarte (00:53:28):
Yeah, it's funny, we spent a lot of time coaching people to look in the camera. So, while I've been talking to you, I'm not actually looking at your face. I'm looking at the little dot at the top of my screen and my camera. And not a lot of people can do that. So, it's gotten to where I can see that little white glowing dot and my heart warms, I know you're there, I feel you. I can get sensations in my skin when I know I'm talking to someone that I adore or admire. And that took a long time to get there. And I was presenting remotely pre COVID. So, a lot of our coaching was about eye contact and doing that. The other thing that happens is people don't see our hands anymore. They're under the table. They can't see how much space in a room we're taking up.

(00:54:15):
They can't see a lot of the characteristics that are common in communicating. And so there's a lot of coaching around presence and how do you have presence in a room? How do you even get the microphone away from someone that's remote and all those kinds of things. And a new study just came out, I just came across my desk today and it said that soft skills really suffered. And the people who did it right say and looked at the camera, they don't have good eye contact skills anymore. When they are looking face-to-face in someone's eyes, it's like, oh, they're not used to it. It's been so long.

(00:54:50):
And then the other thing is, where do I sit in a room who's got the position of authority? Just kind of some classic things that convey information in real life. So, it's interesting, it peaked and now people are going back to the office some. A percent are back in the office. And now we have this weird place where it's, oh, it's half in the office and half people are remote. And the people that are remote are having a hard time getting their voices heard because the people in the room consume most of the air. So, it's kind of going through this undulating life cycle of new communication skills people need while they're remote. It's all changing.

Lenny (00:55:34):
I'm glad that I was not a PM in this remote world to be honest. I never experienced it, but I have a lot of empathy for being a product manager in this remote work world. Feels like the job got a lot harder.

Nancy Duarte (00:55:44):
It did. I think it did.

Lenny (00:55:46):
Yeah. So, let's talk about nerves and stage fright. So, I hate public speaking. I get extremely nervous people. They may not feel this when they watch me, but it's not my natural state. You work with a lot of people that I imagine are like, oh my god, I'm so scared to give this presentation. What advice do you give them to help them through that and feel more comfortable?

Nancy Duarte (00:56:06):
Yeah, I think people who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking have better content. They tend to really think through stuff than someone who's like, I got this. I'll just wing it. I'll just walk on the stage. Anyone who's like, tells me I am a nervous presenter, I'm like, you have probably got gorgeous content in your heart that the world needs to hear, because usually they are really deep and thoughtful. Like you already mentioned, you're a pattern finder and you like to do thoughtful work. And so it's hard. My husband is actually a brilliant communicator, just getting him to feel like he wants to take up the space. He's a better communicator than I am. And so what happens is the reason you get scared, it's a fight or flight instinct. For some reason stepping out on that stage, you feel your body and your mind and your psyche is feeling threatened like you would be attacked by an animal.

(00:56:56):
That's literally what's happening. And so you couple things you could do. You can actually sit in one of the seats of the auditorium and just sit there and look at the stage, look at the setting so you can imagine yourself on it. But then picture yourself as that friendly face, the one that's happy to see you, the one that's delighted that you're speaking. And then as you're standing up, remember that you saw yourself sitting there smiling and very happy. You have to change your visual model that people's faces will be scowling, they'll be judging you, they'll be doubting you. All of those things are only in your head because getting you out on the stage to be able to start to expose people to this amazing content you have, the biggest battle is to get you out on this stage and delivering it.

(00:57:47):
And I asked a bunch of people once, I did a survey of all these public speakers and was like, how do you prepare? How do you prepare? What's your pre-talk ritual? And some of them were like, "I play heavy metal music and I skip around the entire convention center, just get all fired up." I'm like, "Wow, I have to calm myself down because I already have over to the top energy." So, I literally find the dark. I don't go to the green room, that stuff. I don't like to hear gibber jabber. I have to be focused on my content. And so I find the darkest corner of the backstage and calmly sit and just breathe. I just breathe. Sometimes if I'm nervous, if there's someone real famous in the audience, I have a little list playlist of funny things that people sent me, but I never watch. And that way right before I walk on stage, I chemically, my whole body chemically shifts from nervous to laughter. And that really helps me too, because it's chemical and you have to train your chemistry a bit.

Lenny (00:58:46):
I really like that tip. What are these funny things you watch if you-

Nancy Duarte (00:58:50):
It's like YouTube things, TikTok things. Just things that I tag and I try not to watch them or things that make me laugh. There's this dorky low watched video of a guy with tin cans wrapped around his waist and he plays them. And my husband walks around the house like him and making the noise and I could probably sing the beat if I had to. And so sometimes I just play that, because it just transports me home, because a lot of times I'm presenting away from home and it just makes me laugh at my husband who's hysterical. So, it's just random things, but if you laugh and somehow can transport yourself outside of the fear of walking out there, it helps reset you before you walk out on stage.

Lenny (00:59:39):
I really like that. Is there anything else just off the top of your head that just like right before you go on stage that you find to be really effective? So, watching funny videos, I love that. [inaudible 00:59:47] use it. Anything else?

Nancy Duarte (00:59:48):
I breathe. I think I've learned a breathing pattern. I take a deep, deep breath and then I take that one while my lungs are full, I take another gulp of breath and I have to let it out real slow. But when I got the feedback that my friend and some people get over their fear by headbanging to heavy metal, so I'm not saying that's not the wrong thing. So, I thought, well, maybe I should try that before I do a talk. And so I literally didn't do that. But I stretched, I jumped a little, just low jumps, put my arms real big up in the air. And then I walked on stage and I happened to be speaking at a massive medical company, like big brand. And I finished my talk and my assistant got a call and they were like, "We're little worried about Nancy. We think she might need to see a doctor. She could never control her breathing and we're really concerned."

(01:00:38):
And it was just because I just pumped myself up a little bit. So, I don't do that whatsoever anymore. I went back to my calming, contemplative, meditative pre-talk ritual. So, for some people, literally I do encourage people to try headbanging to heavy metal. It might work. It's just a matter of what you need. And nobody would guess that I'm not one to dance around or pump myself up, but I am not, I have to calm myself down. It's the opposite.

Lenny (01:01:09):
Awesome. Just a few more questions.

Nancy Duarte (01:01:12):
Sure.

Lenny (01:01:12):
So, you wrote a book called Illuminate and something that stood out to me from that book is this idea of a torch bearer and torch bearer leader. Can you just talk about what that is and why that is important in power?

Nancy Duarte (01:01:22):
Yeah, I loved writing that book. Co-author Patty Sanchez, a hat tip to her. So, to come up with this book, we knew that there's one presentation, there's a single presentation, could be on a stage, could be in a meeting, just updating people on a project status. And we knew though that every presentation usually is part of a larger movement where you're trying to move people in mass to this alternate future. So, we studied movements, we deconstructed the largest movements. We met with Marshall Ganz at Harvard to say, "Hey, could this be true?" Because he studies movements. It was so fun. And then movements have a five act structure. So, picture, there's this moment where you have to verbalize the dream like, hey, we're going to head to this new place and this is what I have to do at my kickoff meetings. It's like imagine this place in the future that we're headed to.

(01:02:15):
So, it's five steps, it's a five act story structure, if you want to call it five acts. It's dream, leap, fight, climb, arrive. So, the torch bearer, the reason we called that is the leaders know where they're headed, but they might not ever see it super, super clearly. And we chose a torch because a torch, if you're in a cave and you have a torch, you only see about five, eight feet around you, but it's enough to dissipate the fear of the people following you in. And so nobody sees the future clearly. Nobody has that kind of level skill. All we know is I need to traverse this direction to be at the right place in the future so all my staff is safe, all are, we stay a leader in the industry. That's all I know. And as we start to head there, there's these moments of communication you need to do, which is, hey everyone, here's the dream. Here's where we're headed. That's the dream phase.

(01:03:09):
Then there's this moment where they either choose to jump in and go with you or they choose not to. You could talk about Frodo like Sam and only a few hobbits followed him. And so it's like people select to commit this journey. That's the beginning of your movement. But then the middle is the messy middle of a story. We call it the fight and climb phase. So, what happens is they commit to your idea, they commit to your program, your project, and they're like enthused at first. And then they go into the state of, oh my God, this is harder than I thought. It's a long slog. This climb is getting exhausted. I don't know if I have this much fight in me to make this all work, not fight with each other, but like, oh my God, I'm having to overcome this roadblock and that roadblock and we have to go get that budget.

(01:03:53):
So, it's just, it's like a fight, climb, fight, climb, fight, climb. And then ultimately you arrive. Each one of those five phases you need to use speeches, stories, ceremonies and symbols at each phase to give the people traveling with you the emotional fuel they need to keep going, to keep seeing that idea become realized. And it literally is about fueling the right emotions with speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols while you're moving people toward a bigger initiative. So, it's bigger than just one presentation, it's multiple presentations, multiple stories, multiple ceremonies. So, I loved that book. People are really feeding off of it right now because leading change has been nonstop. It's just been change, change, change the last especially few years.

Lenny (01:04:40):
Change is the only constant like they say.

Nancy Duarte (01:04:42):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:04:43):
I really like this metaphor of the torch giving you a sense of, as a leader, you can see some portion around you, but you're not going to see the entire cave necessarily. That is really interesting. Maybe a final question very tactically is I give an interview where you shared that you had kind of two videos, one where it's very informal, you're just standing in front of whiteboard in jeans or something, just talking about some about data, I think in presentations. And then you had a similar video where it was very well constructed, high production value, and the informal video did a lot better. Is that something you're seeing? Just that kind of content ends up being more successful and why do you think that is?

Nancy Duarte (01:05:21):
I think video content, production quality now isn't the expectation for it being high quality. It's just completely shifted over the last five, eight years or so as everyone's an expert and can show up as an expert. There's a big difference to me about showing up as a keynoter, which is like, I'm going to stand, I'm going to look right. I'm going to have this eye contact, I'm going to nail it. My slides are gorgeous, I'm driving the industry. And for people to think that our explanations of things needs to be done as a stand and deliver keynote, that's just not true. So, I experimented with that and I had some videos I had done, and one of them, like you said, was me looking in the camera. I even had HD makeup, a film crew. I was well lit, I looked amazing. I mean, I did look amazing and it was polished.

(01:06:09):
I delivered it really well. And then I thought, because on LinkedIn I post a lot, that's where my primary channel is, and I thought what would happen if I just posted a rando shot of me? And I'm maybe airing on a little bit like orange, I look a little Trumpian, a little bit orange. It's not color corrected, but it's super informative, really full of information. And that was my highest viewed video so far. And I realized that it's like people want the content and we do as a presentation company, I have to nail it maybe more than others, but it doesn't have to be fully video edited, infographics spinning, swooshing things forward and swooshing things back.

(01:06:50):
That kind of nature of it is not necessary to get the message across. And so we actually have a whole process and program we're rolling out where you're going to see a lot more video from us, partially from that insight, but partially because my team, I have a team of experts, they have a lot of great things to share, and so I'm trying to give them, I'm trying to make it be like Duarte does not equal Nancy Duarte. I'm trying to make it so it's like so many experts work at Duarte, you got to watch any video from any of them is where we're moving at Duarte. They're freaks of brilliance and just experts. They're world class experts. So, that's what we're trying to do.

Lenny (01:07:27):
I feel like you have a similar challenge to me where I named my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter.

Nancy Duarte (01:07:32):
Yeah, same thing.

Lenny (01:07:33):
[inaudible 01:07:33] talk about that.

Nancy Duarte (01:07:33):
Same thing.

Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah, can never be anyone else. It's a challenge, but yeah, don't know, it worked out. Okay. Actually, real final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Have you seen examples of product managers specifically telling really good stories?

Nancy Duarte (01:07:46):
The product management process has multiple phase. There's the creative explorative process all the way through to getting it produced. And I think story can take you along in each phase. So, there's example, which I read about, I wasn't actually even part of, but Brian Chesky at Airbnb, there was a whole article where he unpacked this moment in their product development cycle where they decided they would take a walk in the shoes of their customer and they hired a Pixar illustrator to illustrate each scene as the team's like, okay, okay, they said this is her name. And they were like, okay, what happens? Her alarm goes off. Okay, what happens next? What happens next? Okay, now she's decided she needs to book something. What does she do? She wants to do that. They realized from this little walk in the shoes of their customer just this day in the life, which is a classic storytelling method for any product, they realized that they had their strategy wrong, that they needed to move as soon as possible to a mobile first strategy.

(01:08:46):
And it was just because they actually thought about, okay. She goes, brushes their teeth, they do this. They were just literally walking through the life of their ideal customer and that was when they realized they had it all messed up. But the other phases, after all this work people put into product and the making of the product and the managing of pushing it through. We have a large client that makes shoes or athletic things. I love telling stories, but I can't say this. And there's this moment where we get brought in and could you please train our product people in story? We're like, "What's the big problem?" They're like, "They'll spend a year or two on a shoe and be like, chunk, put it on the table. And they're like, what do you have to say about it?" They're like, "It's red." And it's like all these years of investment, all these years, they couldn't unpack any sort of story or any sort of reason or even their passion for why they chose red.

(01:09:41):
And it was like, here's my shoe, it's red. And so this ability to move things along by adding meaning or why and then wrapping it in a story actually can get a product chosen or rejected or there's just so many examples of different spaces in the product cycle that could benefit from a really well told story from, like I said, how the products innovate in the roadmap all the way through to what gets accepted. And then the big reveal, you think about even all the big Apple launches, it's about a big product reveal. It's about revealing this thing that had been hidden for so long and it's another moment to tell amazing stories. So, that's kind of a little bit of an insight on the product side of how to use story.

Lenny (01:10:27):
The Airbnb example is an awesome example. It's all true. When I joined Airbnb is actually right there in the process of doing that.

Nancy Duarte (01:10:34):
I love that.

Lenny (01:10:36):
And they ended up drawing these key frames of the journey as you described, and they put it right in the center of the office. Here's the journey of a host and a guest that's like 12 frames of that journey. And that actually became the strategy of the company is let's pick six of these frames and make them awesome. And that's what we're going to do.

Nancy Duarte (01:10:36):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:10:54):
Make booking experience awesome. Make the arrival experience awesome. So, there's a lot of truth to that.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:00):
And it was visualized, right? The vision was visualized like what you're saying we're headed in the future. And it was super clear. I love that story. So cool you were there.

Lenny (01:11:09):
Yeah, it was very cool. And they actually were very mobile. You could grab one of these drawings and bring it to your desk and how are we going to make this moment better this week?

Nancy Duarte (01:11:17):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:11:19):
And it was actually indeed, Pixar storyboard artist that they hired for a year. That was his job. Draw these key frames.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:25):
Oh, that's amazing.

Lenny (01:11:27):
And it connects so directly with your point about empathy. That was the epitome of empathy. Here's what the guest and hosts are going through, and here's where we can do better.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:37):
Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah, it does tie together.

Lenny (01:11:40):
If folks want to look this up, by the way, we'll link in the show notes. If you just Google Snow White Airbnb, you can watch a video of how they all kind of came about this. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.

Nancy Duarte (01:11:54):
Yep, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:11:56):
What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:00):
I think I always classically recommend the gospels because there's just so much love and groundbreaking thinking there. And then for people who do wind up taking an interest in story, I think one of the best books, if you want to pick that up, is Chris Vogler's, The Writer's Journey, where he took Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, made it 12 Steps, and he was a Disney story analyst. So, it's just really classic body of work that had really helped people get their minds around story and the archetypes.

Lenny (01:12:30):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:33):
It's my little sinful pleasure. It's way into K drama, Korean drama. Don't even ask me how, but I'm way into that. I've seen almost all of them now. I'm at the bottom of the barrel of them.

Lenny (01:12:44):
Is there a favorite?

Nancy Duarte (01:12:45):
No, my husband just watched one. It's called Business Proposal, and he watched it with me and he's like, oh no, now I'm going to be hooked too. They're just real. They're just cute as a button. And they have a longer arc. They're like an epic length tail. They drop in 12 part seasons or one season 12. Anyway, don't even get me started. It sounds dumb, because I like the epic tales and the dramas, but they're cute.

Lenny (01:12:45):
I love it.

Nancy Duarte (01:13:07):
They're just cute.

Lenny (01:13:08):
This is great. Getting very real. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're hiring?

Nancy Duarte (01:13:14):
Oh, favorite interview question. We ask a lot about who they are. So, we use psychometrics a lot here, and we really understand who they are, and we actually ask people to tell a story. And if that's uncomfortable or those psychometrics are uncomfortable, they're not really a fit, because we are a systemic story culture, and we define empathy at the company as know yourself, accept yourself, kind of work on yourself, and then adapt to others. So, if people aren't open to really understanding how they show up then and then adapt and change under our care, then we don't hire them.

Lenny (01:13:51):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Nancy Duarte (01:13:55):
I'm excited about a tool I just paid for last week. It's called writer.com. So, it's built on multiple language models and including, it's going to be trained on our own, all my IP, all my books, every blog post, it'll learn the voice and it'll use my own kind of language model to help us write faster. So, we put really good prompts in and we get a really good product out. So, I'm super excited about that.

Lenny (01:14:17):
I'm actually an investor in that company, so this is great to hear.

Nancy Duarte (01:14:20):
Oh yeah. That's awesome.

Lenny (01:14:21):
Writer.com. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your approach to developing presentations that has had a big impact on your ability to execute and get them out?

Nancy Duarte (01:14:33):
Yeah. I think there's the biggest roadblock for so long that made things painful was the edit cycles. How do we do a round with a client? Then you have multiple version, then you have version control. So, we've come up with this annotation system, so everyone on a project knows exactly the status of that slide, and there's no way really to check slides in and out. And so we've come up with this amazing, beautiful, very visual process where everyone knows the exact status of the slide, and it's really easy. You could put it in thumbnail mode and be like, hmm, we're 80% complete. Everyone's going to focus on just these two things. So, that part of the process, especially enterprise at scale where 20 or 30 people are contributors to a deck. That process we made is the clients are really liking it.

Lenny (01:15:14):
To leave people with one final tip to give better presentations. What would that be?

Nancy Duarte (01:15:18):
To become a better presenter, pick a topic you are passionate about, something where you're like, oh my gosh, I've got to see this happen. And pick that topic and be so passionate about it. Work on that talk or stand up at a volunteer thing and really work on something that makes you feel passionate. And then in the future when you're presenting something that you're not passionate about, everything you learned will apply to a business presentation, but you're going to have that feeling. You're going to know what it's like to present from your soul and from a place of passion and the great presenters tap into that passion point and pull from that, and that's what makes them a great presenter on other topics, that they might not be as passionate about.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Nancy, I so appreciate you making time for this. It's been an honor.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:01):
You're amazing.

Lenny (01:16:02):
Everything. You're amazing.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:03):
You're amazing.

Lenny (01:16:05):
You're amazing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they'd like to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nancy Duarte (01:16:12):
Oh, they can find me at duarte.com. There's also a duarte.com/nancy where I've got a ton of free stuff where you could find a lot of the things I've talked about. I'm on Twitter @NancyDuarte, and I do connect to everyone who connects to me on LinkedIn, which is kind of fun. So, I think, how could they be useful to me? I think it will cure so many problems if everyone became a really good communicator, so you can help me by working hard on your communication skills, working hard on your clarity, and making everyone around you much happier people.

Lenny (01:16:47):
What a beautiful way to end it. Nancy, again, thank you so much for being here.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:50):
Oh, you're amazing. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:16:52):
We're amazing. Let's end it.

Nancy Duarte (01:16:52):
We are. Let's just say it.

# Meta’s head of product on working with Mark Zuckerberg, early growth tactics, and more | Naomi Gleit

## Transcript

Naomi Gleit (00:00:00):
I really believe in frameworks for things that helps drive extreme clarity. I work on a lot of different projects. A lot of times I'm ramping up a new project, I'm like, "Where can I learn what I need to learn about this project?" I ask five different people, get five different answers. That is unacceptable. Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc. Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need about a project and it will link to all the other docs, things on the canonical doc are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Naomi Gleit. Naomi is head of product at Meta. Other than Mark Zuckerberg, she's the longest-serving executive at Meta. She joined what was then called Facebook as employee number 29 and has been at Meta for almost 20 years. She's seen the company scale from 30 employees to the one and a half trillion dollar business that it is today. Naomi does very few podcasts and interviews and so I was really excited to chat with her and have her on this podcast. In our conversation, we dig into the many lessons that she learned from Facebook's early and legendary growth team, her superpower of taking really complex and gnarly problems and projects, simplifying them and delivering results. We also get into leadership lessons she's learned from Zuck, including his recent transformation into possibly the coolest CEO in tech. Also, why PMs are the conductor of product teams, some very tactical tips for running meetings, writing docs, working out, getting better sleep, and even how to get more protein in your diet.

(00:01:31):
This was such a fun conversation and such a wide-ranging conversation and whether you are in product or growth or any other tech function, you will get something useful out of this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Naomi Gleit.

(00:01:56):
Naomi, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Naomi Gleit (00:02:00):
Thanks so much for having me. As I told you earlier, I refer your podcast all the time and so I can't believe I have the opportunity to actually talk on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):
Wow, I'm so flattered. I never get tired of hearing that. Appreciate you sharing that. I want to share a couple of tidbits about you because it's pretty crazy when you see this list. Okay, so you are Meta's longest serving executive other than Mark Zuckerberg. You're employee number 29 at Facebook. You've been there for over 19 years. Sorry, at Meta, formerly Facebook.

Naomi Gleit (00:02:35):
I do that all the time. That's what happens when you've been at Meta for 19 years is you can't get the name right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:42):
Okay, good. I won't feel bad about that Then and then the last thing is just you've been at the center of some of the most foundational products that Meta and Facebook have worked on, including working on the early growth team and thinking about the early growth strategy. Basically you've been there from employee number 30 to today, a one and a half trillion dollars company, one of the largest companies in the world today. Very few people have ever seen this sort of growth and scale from the inside.

(00:03:09):
First of all, I guess let me just ask this, do you ever reflect on this and just realize like, "Holy shit, what a journey I've been on. How wild."?

Naomi Gleit (00:03:16):
It is a great question. I would love to say that I reflect on it. The truth is I think I barely have time to reflect right now. I'm thinking about all the things that I need to do on my to-do list, so I'm pretty in it still. Even after 19 years, I am really focused on the work that I need to do. I do honestly have moments where I get to reflect. For example, on this podcast. Sometimes people do ask me and I think especially as I approach the twenty-year milestone, my twenty-year Faceversary, I'm sure that will give ample opportunity for me to look back.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:55):
Such a classic product manager answer. I have too much to do-

Naomi Gleit (00:03:55):
Too busy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):
I have to think about this. Yeah, I got to hit some goals here.

(00:06:20):
Let me start. I want to start by just how you actually landed at Meta as employee number 29, which is a life-changing decision and a life-changing role and I want to learn if there's something folks can see about what you did that might be helpful to them when they're trying to find a place to work and your story, I was reading about the story and it's super interesting. You basically wrote your senior thesis at Stanford about why Facebook was going to win and why it was going to beat its competitors and the competitors cited I've never even heard of, so it's interesting that that was the competitor at the time. Could you just share the story of how you landed as employee number 29 at Facebook, now Meta?

Naomi Gleit (00:06:54):
Facebook as part of being an academic, researching Facebook, also being a Stanford student using Facebook. I was like, "I really want to work here." Facebook had just moved to Palo Alto. Mark had driven across country I guess, and arrived in Palo. Alto opened up an office at 443 Emerson Avenue or Emerson Street. It was right above the Jing Jing's Chinese restaurant in downtown Palo Alto and I just went to the office sort of cold called the equivalent of just walking into the office and seeing if there were any available jobs. There were not. I think I did that maybe five to 10 more times.

(00:07:31):
Eventually, there was an opening to interview for Sean Parker's personal assistant. He was at the time I think the president. I did interview and I did not get the job. A few months later I found out about a marketing role that was available. And one interesting thing I haven't really talked about was I got an offer from Facebook. I also got a competing offer from LinkedIn, and so at that time I made the choice to go to Facebook because I was interested in the social networking aspect of it. Why was I so bullish on this website at the time it was www.thefacebook.com. Why was I so excited about this thing?

(00:08:12):
I think it's because I definitely saw that there was product market fit. I saw that students at Stanford were obsessed with it, but it also had a long list of colleges that were really excited and on the waiting list to be accepted onto Facebook, and so there was this product market fit piece and also a huge demand from other audiences, other colleges, but our younger brothers and sisters were also sort of interested about Facebook and it seemed like it had this much broader appeal. So that's what happened. I got the marketing job. Cheryl also talks about when you are on getting a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. That was my foot in the door and here we are 19 years later.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:02):
I was just going to say that that's such a good example of what she recommends of if you can get a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask which seat. And I love the Sean Parker piece. I did not know that. That's hilarious. What a different life would've been if you got that job and went down that track.

(00:09:18):
So a couple of takeaways here for people that are trying to pick where to work, what I love about your story is one is you just had so much. You just had confidence that this business would work and you just knew that you wanted to get on this rocket ship. You saw attraction. So that told you I guess that added to this confidence that this was going to work out. And then you said that you walked into the office kind of cold, not even cold emailing or calling, but cold arriving. Five to 10 times you said?

Naomi Gleit (00:09:45):
Yeah, it was pure just refusing to quit. I think I just walked into the office, I talked to the person at the front desk, "Is there anything that I can do?" They weren't hiring non-technical people. I didn't have a computer science degree. I wasn't technical. I had this bachelor of arts degree and that's why the personal assistant in the marketing role eventually did open and was something that I thought I could be qualified for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Cool. I think that's such an empowering lesson of if you look at someone like you and they're like, "Oh, she was so early at Facebook, how lucky," clearly wasn't luck. You knew you wanted to work at this company. You put a lot of effort into making it happen no matter the job. I think that's a really good takeaway and lesson. So if there's a company today that you are excited about that you're just like, "This is going to be a massive success," what I'm hearing is just do everything you can to try to land a job there and eventually you'll be in a role you actually want. It doesn't have to start there.

Naomi Gleit (00:10:41):
When I got to Facebook, I knew I wanted to build. As someone who wasn't really technical, I wasn't going to be an engineer or a coder. I wanted to work with the engineers and the coders to build products. I thought product management was the right function for me, and so my dream was always to be a PM and it wasn't luck as to how I ended up becoming a PM. I sort of took the same approach showing up at the office asking if there were any roles.

(00:11:08):
By then, we had moved to 156 University and all of the PMs and engineers worked on the second floor, and I was working in marketing, like I mentioned, and I worked on the third floor and all the business functions worked on the third floor, and my goal was to be a PM. I ended up going, sort of the analogy, I went to the second floor most days after work, asked if there were any projects that I could help out with.

(00:11:34):
It was very early days. There was always more to do than people to do it. And so eventually I picked up a few projects, helping with program management, giving my product feedback, and by the time that I actually applied formally to be a product manager, I had been doing the job voluntarily, almost informally for a few months.

(00:11:58):
And I remember this because I had a seat on the third floor. I picked up all the stuff on my desk, put it in a box, walked down to the second floor once I got the job to become a PM. And when I got to the second floor, I distinctly remember everyone on the second floor standing and clapping. And so it was a big standing ovation. I'll never forget, Boz was there, by the way. I know Boz has been on your podcast, but even Boz was there sort of standing and clapping. And so I guess to the lesson that you were trying to extract from my story, I do think I sort of tried to create the luck by not giving up and just repeatedly cold calling or cold showing up or cold volunteering until I sort of was able to make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:51):
Amazing. Again, very empowering. It's not just like, "Oh, there's these people that just get lucky they land this PM job." It's like you landed at the company. I want to be a product manager, which is interesting. Most people don't grow up in I want to be a product manager. That's like a rare thing people even want, especially that early on. So it's interesting that you already knew that, but you basically did the job. You did the job of PM before you had the job, and by the time you actually asked for it, you've been doing it for a long time and you could show, "Hey, look, I'm actually good at this. I can do this job." Awesome.

(00:13:22):
By the way, I love the Boz connection. I'm finding that Boz is connected to the most guests of this podcast in so many different ways.

Naomi Gleit (00:13:29):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
Curious. Yeah, like Ami and-

Naomi Gleit (00:13:32):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):
And a few other people. It's just interesting. There's a Boz spiderweb of connections throughout this podcast so far. Okay, so I'm going to fast-forward to today. So your role today is head of product at Meta?

Naomi Gleit (00:13:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:46):
What does that mean? What do you do at Meta today? How would you describe your role?

Naomi Gleit (00:13:52):
There are a few thousand PMs at Meta. They do not all report to me. I would say a few hundred of them report to me on the teams that I directly manage, but I feel responsible for the entire PM community at Meta. There are things that we do centrally, things like PM performance, PM culture PM onboarding and training, and that's the kind of thing that I look out for.

(00:14:16):
Obviously I wanted to be a PM. Head of product is my dream job. I am deeply supportive of the PM function, and so I really care and I think PMs are a huge point of leverage in a company for how we can actually get stuff done and help accomplish the company's goals. And so I sort of focus on PM as a really important exponential lever for doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:45):
I love that. Okay. I'm going to come back to what you've learned about what makes super successful PMs, what makes you really successful. I want to take a tangent to Zuck.

Naomi Gleit (00:14:54):
Please. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:56):
So you've known Zuck for over 20 years at this point, and I just have to ask a few Zuck questions because people are always curious to learn from what has worked so well for him. The first question is just there's been a pretty profound transformation in Mark over the past few years, both in terms of how he leads and also just in his coolness and vibe factor. What are your thoughts on just this transformation and how he's been able to pull it off?

Naomi Gleit (00:15:22):
So I've always said that there is the biggest gap of anybody I know between what people think of Mark and who Mark really is. And so I think this is the Mark that I've known for the past 20 years and the world is finally getting to see what I've been lucky enough to see. And that gap that we've talked about is really starting to close.

(00:15:46):
How did we get here? I always say Mark is a learn it all, not a know-it-all. He is the fastest person at upskilling of anyone I've ever met. He used to do these annual challenges. One year I did them with him, it was learning Chinese, and within a year he was able to basically achieve an eighth grade fluency in Chinese. And that's just one example. Obviously, he's gotten incredibly great at guitar, MMA, a lot of his passions, but he's also gotten a lot better at some of the professional skills. And I think negotiation, public speaking is one of those. I think before in the early days, it just wasn't something that he was very comfortable with. He's talked himself about coming across as a little scripted. I think he was not confident and pretty careful about how he showed up and he's upskilled here. He's just gotten a lot more comfortable, and so people are able to see who he really is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):
He was also like, I don't know, 20 something when he started Facebook and now he's running a 80,000 person org. I could see the emotion habits.

Naomi Gleit (00:16:52):
Yes. I think he might've been 19 or 20 when I came.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):
Oh God, that's insane. So yeah, I could see why someone would change. I was at the Acquired podcast Chase event with him being interviewed, and he's just such a cool dude now. He just has these big shirts with his own letters on it, his own phrases, his chain. What a cool dude.

Naomi Gleit (00:17:16):
His long hair.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:17):
His long hair.

Naomi Gleit (00:17:18):
His watch. Yeah, I was at that event too. I thought it was great. I think, yeah, that's the no gap between who Mark is and what the world sees.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:30):
I love that. Is there something about Zuck that you know that most people don't know? Something that would surprise us?

Naomi Gleit (00:17:37):
The one thing I would say about Mark is I think people know he's married. He has three daughters. He's a really great dad, he's a really great husband. I would say he's also a really good friend. Maybe that's something that I can sort of speak to from experience. He's just an incredibly thoughtful friend. There was a period in my life, I think it was 10 years ago when I was going through just sort of a really hard time. I had come out of a breakup, but Mark saw that I was having a hard time. He asked me if I wanted to volunteer to teach a class in East Palo Alto after their school day.

(00:18:15):
And in retrospect, it's pretty funny, but Mark and I taught a class about how to build a business. So you had the CEO of Meta teaching this class to a bunch of middle school students, and we got really close to them through that process. We made some really important mentorship connections. For years, we met with them. I think we still continue to, even though they've now at this point graduated from college and have real jobs.

(00:18:43):
But one of the lessons that we taught during that class that I remember Mark distinctly writing on the whiteboard, or not the whiteboard, there actually was chalk, it was with chalk on a chalkboard with the four life lessons. That was one, and I kept these for myself as well, love yourself. Two, only then can you truly serve others. Three, focus on what you can control. And four, for those things never give up.

(00:19:12):
And that was sort of his life lessons, four steps to how to approach life. And we actually made stickers for these four steps that the students could actually put on their composition notebooks as a reminder. And I think obviously that has really helped me over time, but I think that in that you can see some of what I think we all see in Mark, for example, for those things never give up. He has that aspect of him and it makes sense. For me number three is really the hardest, which is focus on what you can control. I think I probably think I can control more things than I actually can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
So do we all. I love that he was sharing that in a class on how to start a business, this life advice.

Naomi Gleit (00:20:00):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):
Oh man, that's amazing. I want to chat a bit about, so at this point is 86,000 employees, something like that. That's what I found online. So he has to run this massive org as this CEO, one person. I know that one way that he does this, he has something called a small group. Is that the term?

Naomi Gleit (00:20:24):
Yes, small group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Okay, cool. So he's got the small group that he calls it and it's essentially is like core execs and this group meets regularly, and that's kind of how he's able to manage the entire org through this small group. For people that are struggling to run an increasingly larger org, are there any tidbits from how Mark and the small group operate that might be helpful to folks?

Naomi Gleit (00:20:47):
Sure. So I think the first thing is small group is sort of the leadership team. It's the leaders working on the most important projects at the company, sort of independent of reporting structure and stuff. It's like who are the leaders on the big most important projects or functions? They will be represented in small group.

(00:21:08):
What makes this group unique? A lot of them are people like me, people that have been there for a very long time. So I think the tenure of small group is really rare. Why I think that's important is you have a lot of people that are motivated by mission rather than climbing the corporate ladder at this point. And so there are a lot of what I call disagreeable givers.

(00:21:34):
So just to back up, I don't know if you've heard this framework, but I think I learned this from Adam Grant during an executive learning and development session, and he was saying that if you think of a two-by-two, there's people who are agreeable and disagreeable, and then there's people who are givers and takers.

(00:21:52):
And the most dangerous kind of person to have in an organization is an agreeable taker. And what that means is an agreeable person, super nice, everyone likes them, really easy to get along with, but they're a taker and maybe their motivation is more self-interested rather than what's best for the company, which is how I would define a giver. And the most precious person in an organization is the disagreeable giver. Those are the people who are really motivated to do what's best for the company, but they can be a little bit disagreeable in the sense that they may not say what you want to hear. They may push back on things, they may fight for things. And so I think small group is characterized by a lot of disagreeable givers and I think that's really important for an organization.

(00:22:41):
One thing I think Mark has done really well in general is just have a culture, including on his leadership team, of people who give him feedback. I think a lot of times as you get more successful or as you have more fame or if you have more wealth, you lose having an accurate feedback loop. And people may not want to be a hundred percent honest with you for various reasons. And Mark has tried to ensure that he himself has an accurate feedback loop, or we as a company have more of an accurate feedback loop by surrounding himself and our leadership team and creating a culture of giving direct and honest feedback. So that's some of the unique properties of small group.

(00:23:25):
From a process perspective, we have one weekly sort of strategic meeting. It's more open-ended, there is time for discussion. It's longer and it's sort of more unstructured. We also have one weekly operational meeting, which is highly structured where we go through all of the priority projects. The person who owns each of the projects will actually speak to the weekly updates for that project. And it's very operational and tactical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:55):
Awesome. I just love this name, small group. It's just like a cozy name. It's not like executive staff or ESA after all these terms people always use. And that's just our small group.

Naomi Gleit (00:24:07):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
And then this framework you described, it sounds a lot like radical candor of challenging directly, but caring deeply.

Naomi Gleit (00:24:16):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:16):
Where being disagreeable, but being constructive and additive. Is that the term? What was it? Disagreeable, but?

Naomi Gleit (00:24:23):
A giver.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):
Giver? Yeah.

Naomi Gleit (00:24:25):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:26):
Okay. That's great.

Naomi Gleit (00:24:26):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:28):
If there's nothing here, totally cool. But is there something that you changed Mark's mind about? You've talked about he's good at seeing new data and being like, "Oh, okay, I see, I see." Or is there anything that you were successful there that is an interesting story?

Naomi Gleit (00:24:42):
One of the things that we did in the early days on the growth team, because I'm not sure that necessarily when we talk about this sort of legacy or the history or the lore around the growth team, and this may not be a direct answer to the question, but it didn't really necessarily-

Naomi Gleit (00:25:00):
And this may not be a direct answer to the question, but it didn't really necessarily come from Mark. Mark wasn't like, "You guys should create a growth team. Here's how you should operate." And so I think in some ways we established and grew a growth team and Mark got on board or saw the value in it and was a huge proponent of it, but I'm not sure it necessarily originated with him. And indeed, I think sometimes the focus on being so data- driven might've been something that myself, Alex Schultz, Javier Olavon, these are some of the original people that were on the growth team and that my closest coworkers now may have really pushed on and highlighted the value of for Mark. I'm happy to talk about the growth team, which is something I get asked a lot of questions about, if you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:53):
Yeah, I'd love to. That's exactly where I was about to segue since you brought that up. So the Facebook growth team, it's a legendary team. I think it was probably the first real growth team in tech. The team developed some of the most core growth levers and techniques that companies use today, and so I'm really excited to chat a bit about this and what you learned from that time. One thing I wanted to start with is there's this legendary activation metric that you all had, the goal was to get, I think it was seven friends in 10 days or something like that. Is that a real thing? Is that what you guys actually did? Anything more there for folks that are like, "Oh, we got to come up with something like this"?

Naomi Gleit (00:26:30):
Sure. So yes, seven friends in 10 days was a thing. 10 friends in 14 days was also a thing. They're the same thing, they're just different points on a retention curve. I would say the key insight here is when we started the growth team, I think we were pretty focused on acquisition. We had a notion though of growth accounting, which looks at what's our net growth every day? And that would look at the number of new users that registered minus the number of users that actually went stale. So after a 30-day period, that's how we define it, they no longer logged in. And then plus the number of users that resurrected, which is after 30 days they came back. And what we found was the churn in resurrection lines were actually much larger than the new user line, which implied to us that retention and driving those two lines was actually our biggest lever to drive net growth.

(00:27:22):
And so while we were focused on acquisition, a lot of our focus shifted to be around engagement and retention. How do we drive engagement and retention? We look at the variables that correlate most with that outcome. What we found was friending. And so those two magic moments, having seven friends in 10 days or 10 friends in 14 days really just map to when we feel like your likelihood of being a retained user goes up because you've seen the value in Facebook. And it makes sense, Facebook is much more compelling if you have 14 friends. And the other thing around 10 or 14 days is we wanted it to happen quickly, we wanted to have you experience the magic moment soon after you had registered on the site to prevent you from churning and then us having to resurrect you again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:17):
One of the most interesting lessons from this activation metric that people talk about, because right now everyone's like, "Yeah, of course retention is what you need to focus on. That's what product-market fit is." I think right now that's what everyone knows. I love that you guys basically figured that out, was one of the first times of, "Here's how we understand if our product will last and how to grow retention because it matters most." And retention cohort curves I think was one of the innovations y'all thought about early of just like, "Here's how we track retention, people joining at a certain time, how long do they stick around?"

Naomi Gleit (00:28:48):
Totally. And that was Danny Ferrante who really came up with the growth accounting framework, which I guess is quite obvious, but the plus new minus stale plus resurrected. The thing that I feel like may be valuable for PMs and is one of my Naomi-isms is I think what the growth team really pioneered was being data-driven and product-driven, especially in an area that was historically more of a business function. So I think at that time a lot of the growth in new users was expected to come from marketing or comms, whereas the insight that we had is actually the product is the biggest lever to drive growth, and that means we should have a product and engineering team working on optimizing things like the registration flow, the invite flow, the new user onboarding, getting you seven friends in 10 days.

(00:29:43):
One of my Naomi-isms is really understand, identify, and execute. That framework came from 2009 where the growth team at the time, it was fledgling and it just started, was focused on only instrumenting data. And Alex often wears a shirt that says, "I guess when you can know." We just didn't have the data that we needed to make informed decisions to know really what were the biggest levers to drive growth. And so in 2009 in January, we basically stopped doing anything on our roadmap except data instrumentation. And that's when we instrumented every step of the registration flow, instrumented every step of the news or onboarding experience. We knew where there was drop off. And so we understood, which allowed us to identify what were the key opportunities to drive growth and maybe, hey, it's increasing friending in the user experience or 20% drop off on registered users at the email confirmation step, how can we address that? These are the opportunities that we identified and then we would execute by building products.

(00:30:50):
So having this data-driven product-driven approach to what I think historically was more of a business responsibility at a company was sort of the special sauce of the growth team. We eventually extended that approach. I think that approach started with the growth team, but we extended to other areas. So for example, one of the projects that I took on after growth was social impact. And instead of what I think a normal company might do, which is start a corporate social responsibility wing, we decided, no, we're going to take a data-driven product-driven approach to driving social impact. Instead of having a foundation that's distributing money, we're going to build a product that actually raises money from our community. And many years later we've raised billions of dollars from the community for charity. So that's sort of the approach that I think is unique about the growth team that expanded to other areas and that I think that the company in many ways has taken to most of the problems that we face.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:55):
That's such a good point. And I almost took that for granted, but there was such a huge shift that y'all started from moving from marketing being the driver of growth to product and data and experiments and all that stuff. And so I think that's such a good reminder that, fun fact on the social good team, I'm really close friends with the designer that was on my team, his name's Mickey. He was on that team for a while and really enjoyed and yeah, really enjoyed working with you. Fun fact.

Naomi Gleit (00:32:22):
Oh, that's so great. I remember Mickey, what is his last name?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:26):
Settler.

Naomi Gleit (00:32:27):
Okay. Yes, I definitely remember this, yes. And social impact is just one thing that I think I'm really proud of. And again, remember social impact used to be a business thing. You would create this corporate social responsibility part of the company that was very separate from the product and engineering team.

(00:32:48):
Another thing that we did in the early days was there was a juncture where it was like, "How are we going to translate this site?" And I think we could have taken more of a non-technical traditional approach and had professional translators translate the entire site into the different languages, and instead sort of what the growth team suggested was why don't we build a version of Facebook that allows you to make translations in line? And so the community of people using Facebook at the time who actually knew the product the best could actually insert translations and there was a whole system that we built around how to up-rank the best translations and down-rank, sort of like Wikipedia. And to this day, we have over 100 languages supported. So we're always trying to find these product technology solutions to these sort of traditional problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
I totally remember that, where it's like you ask your users to help translate the site.

Naomi Gleit (00:33:43):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
I want to come back real quick to the activation metric because it's something that a lot of people somewhat misuse and think maybe incorrectly about. So to come up with an activation, as you described, you basically figure out what's the regression of if someone does X, retention increases, and so let's focus on getting them there. And a lot of people struggle with coming up with that metric. Do you have any thoughts on just how important it was to have that very specific activation milestone of seven exact friends in exactly 10 days versus the value of just having anything that is a rallying point for everyone to focus on and drive?

Naomi Gleit (00:34:19):
I think the majority of the value is in the latter, is just having extreme clarity around the goal and that allowed everybody to work towards optimizing the same goal. You're right, we did sort of just pick a point on the curve. I think it could have been any of those. And indeed, as part of preparing for this, I was like, "Was it seven friends in 10 days?" I had to go back and I asked a few people that I worked with back in the day and they were like, "Well, I thought it was 10 in 14." I mean, I think it doesn't matter, it's just that we picked one of them and what mattered there was we had the same goal, what mattered was that it was a retention goal or an activation metric.

(00:34:59):
And one of the most important things that actually came out of having that goal was building a new user experience. Believe it or not, when we first launched Facebook, I wasn't around then, but in the early days of when it was just a college site, we didn't need a news or onboarding. We didn't need to explain to people that they had to find their friends. They were sort of automagically connected to everyone on the college campus and sort of knew how to use this product, it felt very intuitive. Again, we were college students building a product for other college students. They were sitting next to each other in libraries or at desks and sort of through osmosis understanding how the product worked.

(00:35:38):
It was more when we launched the ability for teens to register and then work networks, and then in 2006 open registration where we started getting all kinds of people with any email address, before it was .edu or a microsoft.com email address that was required in order to sign up for Facebook and then anyone with any email just could register including people like my dad and my grandma that we realized, wow, in order to get people to this magic moment, how are we going to do that? What's the most effective way that insight resulted in building a new user experience? I remember it was just like step one, upload your profile picture. That was really important so people could find you and know who you were. Step two, find your friends. That's where a lot of the contact importing and people you may know and, "Here are other people at your school and here are mutual friends." That step in the news or experience ultimately became one of the most important drivers of that activation metric that we talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:40):
I love that you shared that, such a recurring theme on this podcast, the power of onboarding, the value of investing in onboarding and the ripple effects of opportunities there. I love that you also were kind of like the first like, "Onboarding, that's a thing, we need onboarding."

Naomi Gleit (00:36:55):
I know. I mean, I remember the day where I was like, "Do we need to explain to people how to use this? Is it not obvious?" And it's like my dad's like, "I don't understand this whatsoever." My dad would go on to become Facebook's biggest power user because I always beta tested everything with him. But that was not obvious to us at the time in 2006 that we had to explain to people how to use Facebook.

(00:37:25):
And again, remember that it's fun talking about this because obviously the product has evolved so much, but the principles are relatively the same. It was thefacebook.com, eventually it became facebook.com, but eventually we built a mobile app and then it was mobile first product, and then it was about mobile photos, and then it was about mobile videos. So over time, the technology has really changed, but the core use case that we really need to educate people on, which is how to connect with their friends on Facebook and whatever iteration or product is the same. And so obviously we still have an onboarding today and it's relatively the same principles, like get a profile picture and find your friends.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):
Along those same lines, just maybe a last question around the growth stuff that you worked on for folks that are thinking of driving growth, working on onboarding maybe specifically just are there any lessons from things that worked super well when you were looking to accelerate growth of the Facebook early on that you think people are maybe sleeping on as lepers and tactics that worked back then that might still be really powerful today?

Naomi Gleit (00:38:36):
Well, definitely the understand, identify, execute. I would just ask yourselves, do you have the data that you need to know what you need to do on growth? And if not, definitely take the time to instrument that data.

(00:38:49):
The thing that, I think we were relatively lucky, I talked about why I was bullish on Facebook in 2005 even was because there was product-market fit. And so for us growth, as much credit as we give to the growth team, I'm actually not sure how much credit we deserve and how much incremental growth we drove above and beyond the fact that this was a product that had product-market fit and we benefited in a huge amount from having high demand for the product.

(00:39:23):
So at every step, and I talked about the growth team, the projects that we were working on were really at a high level around removing barriers. There were macro barriers, like the first project I worked on was high school students on Facebook, which is an interesting story in and of itself because at that time we almost created a separate website called Facebook High just to keep them separate from the college students. But at that time we were like, "No, this is one graph. This is one community. College students have friends and people they're connected to of all different ages. Why bifurcate the graph?" And obviously we've maintained that principle ever since.

(00:40:04):
But it was about removing barriers. So you had to be a college student, then you had to be a high school student, then you had to be in a work network, then you had to have any email address. One of the next projects I worked on was not everyone has access to a smartphone, how can we remove the barrier of having access to a smartphone and building more of a rich Facebook experience for someone that was using a feature phone or a lower-end device? Internet.org, what about removing the barrier of having access to the internet or being able to afford a data plan? And so those are the macro barriers that thematically the growth team has worked on.

(00:40:40):
What I would say is maybe applicable is really the micro barriers. All of the work that we did on growth around optimizing the flows were really about removing micro barriers. One of the things that I thought was just so elegant was after we did that 2009 instrumentation of all the flows, the product flows relevant to growth, what we found is 20% of people aren't actually confirming their email. We tried sending them an SMS, so maybe they would confirm the SMS instead. What we found was a lot of people are actually still clicking on notifications that they're getting, but because it wasn't the specific confirmation email, we weren't able to confirm the account.

(00:41:21):
And so what we did was allow people to get notifications even as an unconfirmed account, and then if they clicked on any of those notifications, that would count as an account confirmation as well because they proved ownership of the email. It's just removing a micro barrier of having to go find the confirmation email, click it before you can do anything on the site. So I do think we've been relatively lucky in having a lot of high demand That meant that we could focus on just removing micro barriers. And then on the growth team, a lot of the iterations and optimizations were about removing just sort of friction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
I love that framework of micro barriers and macro barriers, just thinking about ways to make this accessible to more people and also just helping them get through the flow faster. I also love your point about how a lot of growth teams get a lot of credit for growing a business when really in many ways it could have done really well even without that team potentially because product-market fit was so strong. I think about this with Airbnb honestly as just such after it gets to a certain point, such good product-market fit that who knows what would've happen if there was no one working on growth? It probably would've been okay for a long time.

Naomi Gleit (00:42:27):
Totally. And then maybe where we do sort of see the impact is maybe something like the translations thing that we talked about. With the macro barrier, removing the language barrier, and so maybe the approach we took meant that we supported 100 plus languages instead of whatever the professional translators, we have the long tail of languages so that last person who's still speaking a near extinct language can still use Facebook. But yeah, I think that's right. I sometimes think that maybe some of our efforts were really more on the margin of a bigger trend around product-market fit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):
Final little thing I would just want to highlight again that you said that I think is so important, and I've always thought is true and I love that you confirmed it, is that the activation metric that you all rallied around the biggest value of it wasn't this is exactly the right regression connection to retention, it's more that we have something we are all going to focus on, and that is where most of the impact comes from is let's get more people to that point, whether it's perfectly right or not, it doesn't really matter.

Naomi Gleit (00:43:32):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:32):
Love that. And I think that's really freeing to a lot of people because they're like, "Oh, we don't know if we're going to be as perfect about this versus let's just drive some growth and get people who are good enough thinking on that." Okay, great.

(00:43:45):
You mentioned Naomi-isms, I want to segue to that. So let me first read a quote. So I asked Adam Mosseri, who is Head of Instagram, what to ask you. I know you guys work together on a bunch of stuff. Here's how he described you, "Naomi is called the conductor here at Meta. She has an incredible ability to handle the most complex projects and problems and bring the right people together to simplify and solve them. She is very firm yet kind. Her standards are extremely high, and she sets the bar." Also many other people that I messaged said very similar things about you, about how you're incredibly good at taking very complex problems and getting shit done, getting them done, simplifying them and getting them done.

(00:44:27):
So I want to spend some time understanding what you've learned about how to do this well. What are the skills you've collected that allow you to take really complex problems and get to a solution, stay kind but firm and take on these really hard challenges? So maybe just broadly, I'm curious, what are some of these skills that you have built that allow you to do this?

Naomi Gleit (00:44:51):
Yeah, well also that's very kind of Adam. I adore Adam obviously, he is one of the tenured people in small group and I've actually gotten the opportunity to work even more closely with him than usual. We recently launched something called Teen Accounts and Adam and I worked very closely on that.

(00:45:10):
In terms of how I do the things people say that I can do, I really rely on Naomi-isms. Like I said, and actually I refer your podcast out a lot because there isn't just a PM university that I can send people to, there isn't a formal training that people can get to become a product manager, and that's where Naomi-isms came from. It was stuff that I learned on the job from other people, including from Adam, that I found myself repeating over and over again. "A good PM looks for a way to make that more efficient," for me, that was writing them down, people started calling them Naomi-isms. I started sharing them internally. And then I think two years ago, I also started sharing them externally.

(00:45:52):
Adam referred to me as a conductor, that's one of the Naomi-isms, in my role as Head of Product, I want to educate the PM community about what is PM? It's the most common question I get from PMs and non-PMs, "What do PMs do? What makes a great PM?" And what I say is a PM is a conductor. It's as though the team that you are a PM on is an orchestra. There are many different functions in your team that includes legal policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design, much like there are many different instruments in an orchestra. And as a PM, your job is to make sure everyone's playing their part correctly, every section in the orchestra is playing their part, but at the same time, they're playing together, they're unified in the music that they're producing and that they're playing at the right tempo.

(00:46:48):
And a lot of times I think people use music analogies or vocabulary to describe the work, and that includes things like people being in harmony, like a good team, a good PM, a good orchestra is in harmony, they're in sync, they're at the right tempo, they have the right cadence. That's sort of how I imagine what a PM does at work. Important characteristics are the PM is not the star of the show. Indeed, conductors don't even say anything during the performance. And also, I would at the same time give PMs little metronomes and conductor wands. This was something that I used to do when we were smaller., Just to sort of take the analogy way too far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:29):
That's so funny. You actually gave him conductor wands and metronomes?

Naomi Gleit (00:47:32):
Oh yeah, just to wave around. Yeah, I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
I would love a conductor wand.

(00:47:38):

Naomi Gleit (00:48:57):
So PM as conductor is sort of how I describe the product management function, but one of the key Naomi-isms that I think is really critical to getting stuff done is what I call extreme clarity. I think our jobs are super hard. Extreme clarity means everyone's on the same page. It definitely doesn't mean that they all agree with each other, but they just have the same understanding of the facts. So we can disagree, but we all believe in the facts, which is that there's A, B, C, our options are X, Y, Z and here are the trade-offs 1, 2, 3. That kind of shared understanding is what extreme clarity is.

(00:49:36):
That came from a place of just being in many meetings, on many emails, in many situations where I felt like we actually agree on something, the nature of this conflict is a result of misunderstanding. And that seems like an incredible waste of time. And so we want to have extreme clarity so we can just focus our conversations on things when we actually agree, not when we are misunderstanding each other. There are a lot of tactics that I use to drive extreme clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):
Yeah, I was going to ask how you do that, that sounds great.

Naomi Gleit (00:50:00):
... Tactics that I use to drive extreme clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):
Yeah, I was going to ask how do you do that. That sounds great. How does one get to extreme clarity?

Naomi Gleit (00:50:07):
So another name I'm using is canonical everything, so that includes canonical nomenclature, I often talk about canonical nomenclature. One way to ensure extreme clarity is we have the shared vocabulary. I've been in a lot of situations where people are using the same or different words to describe the same or different things, which results in talking past each other. One of the most egregious examples of this is when I was working, I was in a conversation around how our reviewers and global operations were performing, and we were using consistency and accuracy interchangeably. Consistency refers to how often different reviewers agree on the decision. Accuracy refers to how often the decision is correct according to ground truth. Those are very different things. We don't want to optimize for consistency because you could be consistently wrong. We want to optimize for accuracy.

(00:50:56):
And so that is what canonical nomenclature is literally writing out all the words in their definitions, so when we communicate, we are using the same vocabulary. I really believe in visuals. I think sometimes just having a conversation or a big meeting where people are talking, I'm just not very auditory, I'm a very visual person, it's hard for me to follow along just by listening. I will often have a visual in a meeting. I will leverage that visual to literally real time edit what is being decided. For example, if we have multiple options, I will edit the slide that's being projected to say, "We decided on option one, here are the next steps, 1, 2, 3." A lot of times people are saying, "That's not what I heard. I heard this as a next step, or I heard that as a next step." I love that because that avoids leaving the meeting and being like, "I don't know what we agreed to. I heard this, you heard that." No, actually we haven't agreed upon set of decisions and next steps that we all real time edited and looked at together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):
Just to double click on that one real quick, so what you're describing for the visual is you're presenting here's our options, here's our three options on a slide. You all decide we're going to go with option two, you edit the slide with a star, here's what we chose, and then maybe change some stuff. And this is exactly to your point of extreme clarity, people can see clearly this is what we're choosing. If they disagree and don't realize that's what's happening, it'll be really clear.

Naomi Gleit (00:52:17):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):
Awesome.

Naomi Gleit (00:52:19):
And one thing people make fun of me a lot for that I think is just a great example of extreme clarity is I never use bulleted lists because you can never refer to a bullet. I always use numbered lists because you can always in the visual in a meeting as referenced in number two, I have feedback on that, versus the third bullet, two up from the second, whatever, that is not extreme clarity. So it's very, very small tactical things to bigger things like canonical everything. But I can be a little bit strict.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):
I love that very tactical tip and that is awesome, that's exactly the stuff I look for. Is there any other very nuanced tip along those lines that is helpful in extreme clarity or canonical everything?

Naomi Gleit (00:53:09):
Canonical everything... And stop me if I'm getting too wonky, I can really get into this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):
We got a ways to go.

Naomi Gleit (00:53:18):
When I had a face bursary, along the years people have given me posters and the posters say these Naomi-ism, so extreme clarity is one, canonical everything is another. I think people really associate me with canonical, canonical, canonical. I always want a canonical doc. This came from a place of me I work on a lot of different projects, a lot of times I'm ramping up mid-project, I'm like, "Where can I learn what I need to learn about this project?" I ask five different people, get five different answers, that is unacceptable. Everyone should know exactly where the canonical doc is. That's the one place I can go to get all the information I need about a project and it will link to all the other docs. Of course, I'm sure there's hundreds of docs associated with the project, but there needs to be one canonical doc, and that canonical doc really has to have the basic information that you need to know.

(00:54:05):
For any project, the basic information that you need to know is what are the discrete areas of work, I call those work streams, this is pretty obvious. Who are the owners on those work streams? So for every work stream there's an owner. Again, it seems pretty obvious. Sometimes I'm like, "Who's owning this?" And it's like people don't know. That's why I think it's very important to have a single-threaded owner. We used to call this a directly responsible individual or a throat to choke. We obviously don't say that anymore. Single-threaded owner, every work stream has a single-threaded owner. Sometimes work streams are really big. You have sub work streams underneath them. Everything canonical needs to recurse, so you should have an owner or an STO for the sub work stream. The other things on the canonical doc are what is the process by which the people on this team work together.

(00:54:54):
I hate pairwise conversations. I feel like they're a waste of time. I feel like you could have four conversations with four different people or one conversation with all four people. Everyone has the same context. Ideally there's a visual in that meeting and you real time edited it, there is extreme clarity. The canonical doc will have what is the canonical meetings that people have, what is the canonical email list that you're going to use, what is the canonical workplace chat. Let's not reinvent the same audience 10 different times with different permutations of the people on the working team. Let's just have one canonical chat. And then often the canonical doc will have the canonical nomenclature. I really believe in frameworks for things that helps drive extreme clarity. A framework is best understood when there's a visual representation of the framework in my mind, and so we'll have canonical visuals and that's what I mean by canonical everything. So anytime I start on a new project, everyone knows to send me the canonical doc.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:52):
I love this. If you come into a that you've given that's really gnarly and complex, what do you find are the first couple things you do that make a big dent on helping everyone align and understand what happens, what they should be doing and what they should be prioritizing?

Naomi Gleit (00:56:12):
A lot of times I'm simplifying. A lot of times there isn't a canonical doc and so I'll go through the process of creating that, but I think that really falls under the simplification thing. I often go into a project, everyone's operating at a PhD level, I'm coming in at a kindergarten level, and so I need to understand... It's almost like all of this complexity we're at a PhD level, I need to create the curriculum, go back to basic building blocks for the kindergarten level, how do I explain that and understand this project at a kindergarten level. It doesn't mean I want to oversimplify, that's not what a simplifier does. They're not oversimplifying, but what they are doing is identifying the most basic building blocks of a complex problem and then unfolding, or revealing or building on top of them additional complexity and details as you go along.

(00:57:06):
And so sometimes I talk about a school pyramid, but I need to establish the kindergarten curriculum and then the elementary school curriculum and then the high school curriculum and then the college curriculum, and then we can operate at the PhD level. But oftentimes people on the project are at really different levels of understanding or complexity. And until we have what we call the school pyramid, the curriculums for every level of the project, it's really hard to make progress. A lot of times that process of simplification will often identify what are the most important things to deal with on the project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):
And so what I'm hearing is when you come into a project and the way you simplify is you start putting together a doc that describes these things you're talking about, here's the work streams, here's the owners, here's the process, here's our canonical meeting style, and that reveals here's what matters most and where there's confusion.

Naomi Gleit (00:58:07):
Yes, yes. Yeah, that is. And a lot of times what needs to happen in the project is sometimes there's a strategy or an execution issue and sometimes there's a people or a process issue. I would say 80% of the time I think it's a people or process issue. And that refers to not having the right people on the project, or having the right people but not having the right process by which they work together, a strategy or execution issue. When we get to that, I first try to tackle those or in general I think it's really important to have perfect execution. I want to make sure a project is perfectly executing, because only then can we really reevaluate whether or not this strategy is right or wrong. We're in the worst of all worlds where we are imperfectly executing and therefore, at the end of the day, the project might fail, but we don't know why.

(00:59:02):
Is it because the strategy was right or wrong or is it because the execution was poor? The ideal case is the strategy was right and you perfectly executed on it. The next best case scenario is the strategy was wrong, but you perfectly executed on it, because then you learned the strategy was wrong. Revamp the strategy and try again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:22):
You're really in the PM part of my brain. I feel like most PMs listening are like it has clean documents, really simple processes, there's one person to charge, it links to everything. It just feels good.

Naomi Gleit (00:59:34):
Totally. And, again, sometimes I feel the need to defend that the process is not for process' sake, it's ultimately to help us all move faster and work better. So hopefully that comes through. But I deeply believe that it is through this approach that we can move faster. And you have to prove that nobody wants more process and more meetings and more, but my goal is that with this we're actually simplifying process and getting less meetings and just making things clearer and ultimately moving faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:08):
I'm going to read another quote from another one of your co-workers, Charles Porch, he's vice president of global partnerships at Instagram and he basically said what we've been talking about, some of the biggest strategic bets and biggest swings Meta has made have had Naomi at the helm. No one can hurt cats, drive clarity, and get to outcomes more seamlessly than she can. She's legendary within Meta for her canonical documents.

Naomi Gleit (01:00:33):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
Maybe just following this thread a little bit further, what's the gnarliest project that you've worked on that would be a good example of you coming in and helping simplify and get it over the finish line?

Naomi Gleit (01:00:47):
Well, Charles may be thinking of the most recent project that we worked on. I don't know if it's necessarily the gnarliest, but it's definitely one of the most cross-functional projects that I've worked on before. Basically every team at the company in some way works on youth. And last week we actually launched teen accounts, which was a very complex project. Again, it involved the Instagram team, the central youth team, the different teams working on various aspects of this, every function, legal policy, comms, marketing product. And I think we definitely leveraged a lot of these Naomi-isms. And just to give you a sense of what teen accounts is, it was basically putting all teens into the safest settings by default on Instagram. And the reason I'm working on this, I work across multiple teams at Facebook, so obviously Adam is the head of Instagram and I work closely with him on this, like I was referring to yesterday.

(01:02:02):
But this is something, these teen accounts, is something that we are thinking about how we expand to the other apps that we have, including Facebook and WhatsApp and Threads. And I tend to work on projects that are across our family of apps and future platforms, and that's why I was involved in this. But basically what teen accounts does is put teens in these safest settings. It's super focused on trying to address parents' biggest concerns around their teens on social media. This has obviously been a really big topic. We've had a lot of these features and tools. What this launch did is simplify things, standardize things, and add a lot more functionality that gives parents control.

(01:02:42):
I think the thing you really need to know is that for under 16-year-olds, if they want to change any of these defaults, they're going to have to get their parents' permission. And so it's interesting that we're really going to create an incentive for teens to get their parents involved and to actually set up parental supervision, especially because one of the default settings is a private account. So there's tens of millions of teens that currently have public accounts today that we are going to automatically transition to private accounts unless they get their parents' permission to stay public. And so it's a relatively big shift, fundamental change for how Instagram works for teens, and I would say one of the more complicated projects that I've worked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):
Yeah, and it just launched, right?

Naomi Gleit (01:03:30):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):
As a new father, I'm excited for you all to be working on these sorts of things. I don't need it yet, but I'm glad it's going to be there. And it's funny how Meta and Facebook is in this world where people complain about teens using social media and then you work on making the product better for teens and kids using social media, and then it's like, "Facebook's getting teens on social media." There's no way to make it feel good to people. No matter what you do, people are going to complain. That's what-

Naomi Gleit (01:04:00):
Totally. And I think the goal of this launch was to orient ourselves and really there's a lot of complaints, there's a lot of different voices. I think we just are focused on parents. We think parents know best. Every kid is different and parents know their own kid the best. So that has been our north star in terms of the approach here. When I talk about teen accounts, as product people I think one thing that you would appreciate is the thing that I think is really important when it comes to teens on the internet is really having an understanding of how old someone is when they're using our apps. And it's important that we know how old they are because then we can put them in an age-appropriate experience. So now we have teen accounts, we want to put all teens into teen accounts.

(01:04:49):
We all know sometimes teens lie. That's been the biggest feedback that we've been getting is teens are really smart, they're going to find workarounds, they're going to be creative, they're going to lie about their age. And as a product person, the way that I think this should really work is that instead of everyone entering... Teens use, on average, 40 apps, instead of Instagram and the other 39 apps that teens use trying to verify the age of the person using their app is for two companies to do this, which is Apple and Google, they do collect the age, they should make that available to developers. And we ask for information from the device all the time with user consent, can Instagram have access to your camera, can Instagram have access to your location information? Apps should be able to ask, can Instagram have access to your birthday? And that would, I think, elegantly from a product perspective, from a simplification perspective, from a privacy preserving perspective and what's easiest for parents, that would be the right product solution to solve this problem around age that we're all trying to grapple with right now.

(01:05:56):
And there's a lot of stuff that we're doing. Part of the reason that this project was so complicated, and I mentioned the age team, is we're building classifiers to try to predict how old people are based on not just the age that they've stated, but based on who they're talking to, what kind of content they're looking at, what the age of the people they're connected to is, do we think that this is actually an adult like they say, or is it really a teen. And so we're doing a lot to try to predict age or prevent people from lying about their age, but I think this would be a really big win for the industry.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:31):
Makes sense to me.

Naomi Gleit (01:06:33):
Okay. Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:38):
So to close out this portion in this chapter of our conversation on Naomi-isms, I know something else that you're really good at that I've heard from a few people is running meetings, something that a lot of people always want to get better at. Any tips? What have you learned about running a great meeting?

Naomi Gleit (01:06:54):
A meeting is a high value and it's high cost amount of time, and then I want to make sure it's as productive as possible. What I will do is send an agenda 24 hours prior to the meeting. That agenda will include a pre-read. I've talked to people who if the pre-read is not attached to the calendar invite or associated with a meeting at least 24 hours in advance, they will cancel the meeting. That just goes to show we want everybody in the meeting to have full context, have read the pre-read. Often what will happen in the previous 24 hours is because we're all sending pre-reads on Google Slides, there will be a lot of conversation and questions that get hashed out leading up to the meeting. During the meeting, like I said, I think it's really important for a group of people to be looking at something and anchoring people on something.

(01:07:48):
If somebody joins the meeting, say, five minutes late, they should know exactly where in the agenda you are in the meeting and what is being discussed based on catching up from the visual that's being projected. Usually a meeting can be and hopefully a meeting is really either is a decision meeting. So if there is a decision, I need three options and I need a recommendation that should hopefully help focus the meeting. And then, like I said, I will real-time edit the visual such that we document and have extreme clarity on what is the option that we agreed on and any next steps that we also agreed to.

(01:08:28):
After the meeting, anyone who wasn't in the meeting, that's fine because within 24 hours post-meeting I will send the notes, reply all to the meeting invite and send the notes. So just tactically, I use the calendar invite as the canonical unit by which to handle all of this communication because a lot of times meetings are one-offs, there isn't an existing email or chat thread that maps perfectly to the audience of the meeting, so for me that is the meeting or the calendar invite. So I'll click on the calendar invite, reply all, include the pre-read, pre-meeting, and then do this reply all again post-meeting 24 hours with the notes and the decisions and the next steps.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:11):
I love this. So many very specific tactics here. I love it. This is food for my brain. I love the always have three options and a recommendation, that's such a simple thing to recommend, but such a powerful way of operating as a PM, just like, "Here are the options, here's what I recommend, here's why."

Naomi Gleit (01:09:29):
Oh, one thing I forgot that I learned from Guy Rosen, he is our chief security officer, is when you have three options and a recommendation, in terms of evaluating the options, I don't love pros and cons. It's a flat list of text. It's hard to just get the big picture from that. Oftentimes we'll use a traffic light. That means that the three options are three rows. The columns in the table will be criteria by which to evaluate the options. Those could either be functions. So for example, if I have three options as the rows, column one could be the legal perspective, column two could be the policy perspective, column three could be the privacy or product perspective. Alternatively, the columns could map to different criteria like what we're optimizing for. So it could be the user experience, it could be the engineering feasibility, it could be the internal complexity, whatever are the criteria should be laid out in the columns.

(01:10:31):
And then obviously it should be color-coded, red, yellow, green based on how it stacks up against those criteria. And what this allows is to get back to the point of the visual is you can quickly look at the three options, see where's the most red, and rule that out. Ideally, the recommendation has some combination of the more green or yellow than the other options. And then obviously within these cells you can spell out the specific rationale for the coloring. But I think this is a really good way to run a meeting and just create extreme clarity around how you're evaluating the options in a way that a flat list of pros and cons just doesn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):
What other podcasts would have this level of detail of how to run a discussion on a decision? And this is exactly what people want to hear, so I love it. So product market fit for listeners of this podcast. I love it. I love it. And obviously the reason this is more effective is it's not just like, "Here's a quick sentence on the pro and con." It's like, "Here's what I actually think this is good or bad for the things that matter to the business."

Naomi Gleit (01:11:39):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:40):
So that makes tons of sense.

Naomi Gleit (01:11:41):
It also gives people a framework to plug into. A lot of times the creation of a pre-read for these discussions involves many different people from many different teams and functions. If you have a traffic light, they can own filling out their cell, they can own the rationale behind the legal position on option one, two, and three. And, in general, I'm super into frameworks that allow people to plug into and clearly represent their point of view.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:08):
I love it. Final question, completely different topic. I saw a Wall Street Journal story about how you exercise and your exercise regimen, and how important that is to your life and career. Now, most people don't have a Wall Street Journal story about their exercise regimen, especially a tech worker. And I know this is just important to your work, and they wrote that this basically helps you become better at your job. Any advice there for folks that want to lean into exercise, exercise more for how to actually do that? Because your advice is this actually makes you better at work and life.

Naomi Gleit (01:12:44):
People are always like, "What are you training for?" And I'm like, "I'm training for life." I have four musties, it is eat, sleep a long time, and exercise. Those are the things that I need in order to perform. And the other areas of my life seems pretty obvious, but until recently I actually did not prioritize sleep. My boyfriend is actually super into sleep and we have the Eight Sleep, we have eye masks, we have blackout shades, we have good sleep hygiene, and so I'm getting much better at that. But exercise is something that I've always been on top of. Alone time is also a musty for me because I'm an introvert, I need that time to recharge, otherwise I think I get weird around people.

(01:13:28):
In terms of how I prioritize it, it's a non-negotiable or table stakes, every morning I have to work out. I am also lucky enough to work in an environment where I can wear workout clothes to work, which I often do. I think working out is sure the hour of the day that I'm doing my exercise, but I also view, like I said, life is a workout, performing at work is a workout. I need to be able to move. I need to feel comfortable. It's very physical, I think, especially if you're trying really hard to be a conductor, and I'm running around with a metaphorical conductor wand, I need to be able to move. A while ago, and that's what the Wall Street Journal article was about, I set a goal of doing five pull-ups. I'd read somewhere in an article that less than 1% of women can actually do. I think having a goal is really helpful.

(01:14:22):
That's something that I worked on, and anyone can do this truly if you train for it. I think it's potentially more technique for me than strength per se, and I worked up towards that goal. I think exercise, in addition to all of the physical benefits, primarily has a mental health benefit I think for me. And also there are just a lot of lessons that I think I take from exercise. For example, I think being able to do five pull-ups taught me I can do hard things in this really narrow, measurable way, which gave me confidence in other aspects of my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:01):
I had a friend who her goal was...

Naomi Gleit (01:15:00):
Another aspect of my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:02):
I had a friend who her goal was do one push-up.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:06):
One push-up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:06):
She's like, "I want to be able to do one push-up" and that was really motivating to her. And then she finally got there and then she could do more.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:12):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:13):
Yeah, similar. I have so many notes here as that you were talking. The other is sleep advice. So eye mask. I have an awesome eye mask that I'll recommend in the show notes. It's funny.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:23):
Please.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
What is that? Of all the things I've recommended in all the various places I get the most comments about, "Thank you for this very specific eye mask. It changed my life." It's like WAOAW, it's one Tim Ferriss has often recommended.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:36):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):
W-A-O... I'll link to it in the show notes, but it's-

Naomi Gleit (01:15:39):
Oh, great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:41):
WAOAW, let me look it up real quick 'cause people are going to be like, "Oh, I got to get it." WAOAW eye mask.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:46):
The one that we have has cushions around the eyes such that it's not flush against your eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
Yeah, this is the same. Okay.

Naomi Gleit (01:15:55):
Oh great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):
W-A-O-A-W sleep mask on Amazon. It's 13 bucks and amazing. My wife and I both sleep with these eye masks. It's ridiculous until you're like, "I can't sleep without one now."

Naomi Gleit (01:16:10):
Totally. Well there's a lot of research that even ambient lighting results in lower quality sleep. So I think that's why the blackout shades and the eye mask just help ensure it's truly dark.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:20):
Yeah, I was just watching a podcast and the advice there is even your smoke alarm with a little light is too much light. You need to cover that up to create real darkness and why not just wear an eye mask? You don't have to worry about any of that.

Naomi Gleit (01:16:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:36):
Okay, and then one thing I didn't mention when you're talking about the conductor, the PM as a conductor, that's exactly the metaphor I've always used my entire career when people ask me about what is product manager? So we're alike.

Naomi Gleit (01:16:46):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:47):
Yeah, I have all these slides of here's the PM and it's like a symphony and the conductor standing there.

Naomi Gleit (01:16:52):
Lenny, do you know how happy that makes me? Because I feel like sometimes people are like, "That sounds crazy," but the fact that you actually came to that same conclusion makes me... Why did you come to that conclusion? I'm just curious

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):
Because as you said, the PM's not making the thing. They're just helping each of the people who are the most talented at their very specific skill do the best possible work and their back is to the audience. They're trying to stay out of the way even though they come in, everyone claps for them, the outstanding event, and then in theory they could step in a little bit to help out when they can pinch it on design here and there and research here and there, probably not engineering. So those are the reasons and they're not in charge. The chair wind violinist is the actual person that's making the music and the best at this thing.

Naomi Gleit (01:17:48):
It's so great to hear somebody else talk about this too. Thank you. And I think that that is really how I view my role and what I do and I think maybe just hearing you talk about it reminded me why I think I put so much emphasis on just elevating the people on my team and the people around me and candidly, one of the development areas for me, and it could be downstream because I do have this analogy of how to be a PM, is that the growth feedback or the constructive feedback for me is really learning when to lead from the front more. Maybe when to be less of a quiet conductor that's really elevating the first chair violinist and be more front facing.

(01:18:39):
I think a lot of my approach and my leadership style is really leading through the people on my team and helping grow them. And a lot of times I think that they're dedicated, they're experts, they know particular areas. Obviously as a head of product, I manage a portfolio of different projects of which each of them has the incredible leader on it. And so oftentimes I'm just really trying to lead from behind and help them be as successful as possible. But there is a time and a place when maybe that silent conductor needs to take more of a vocal and front facing role.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):
I know exactly what you mean. I had the same problem when I was a PM because there's always this fear that PMs in charge and telling everyone to do. And so I had the opposite of like, "Okay, and that's not me. I'm going to just let you do the things you think are best and I'll just make sure the best ideas come to the surface," and I have to learn exactly the same thing. Sometimes people just want you to point them in the right direction and make the decision in the end. And the best PMs are people that have the best opinions about what is going to work, how intuition of what users need, have strong product sense and all that stuff. I've had this post that I'm trying to work on along these lines where there's this reaction to PMs aren't the CEO of the product.

(01:19:56):
They're just like... No, don't call yourselves that. I think it's the opposite. I think PMs actually should think of themselves as the CEO of the product, not in terms of they are in charge and can fire people and manage people, but they're the closest heuristic for what the CEO and the founder wants. They think of what does the business need, what is going to help the customers, what's going to help us grow? And I think the PM is the closest to that role and so I think it's important to think of that role as that even though you're not technically in charge.

Naomi Gleit (01:20:25):
And maybe you could call it something different, but I totally agree with that sentiment. I think we were trying to push against the criticism that PMs were bossing everybody around, but actually I think you-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):
There's baggage there.

Naomi Gleit (01:20:43):
There's baggage there. I call it, there's something called the great non-technical. There was a period of time at Facebook where I think the PMs really had to prove their value to the engineers and show that we were not slowing things down with all this extra process. You can imagine an engineer hearing me talk about how to run a meeting and all the canonical docs and just be like, "What? This sounds terrible." So yeah, we had to prove that, but I actually do think the PM is the closest to really channeling what the CEO or the founder wants. Another thing that I've worked on and that I'm working on is really developing a much stronger first-party perspective. It's not enough for the PM to run this people in process that we talked about. Obviously I love that stuff. I lean that way, but at the end of the day, a PM cannot outsource their perspective or delegate their thinking through people and process.

(01:21:46):
And so for me that has been a learning curve and I am trying to, as someone who's very consensus driven, I want to hear all the different opinions from all the different people. I can still do that. I can still through people in process talk to all the different folks working on a project, hear their first party perspectives and then use all of that to synthesize my own because it will be unique given my role on the team and just what I'm trying to optimize for and really make sure that I both develop that first-party opinion and communicate it clearly. And like you said, the best PMs I think can do it all.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
Just to follow this thread, one thread further, because this is something I think a lot of product managers work on and are told to work on, is there anything you've found to be helpful in building this skill in yourself that might be helpful to folks that are working on it?

Naomi Gleit (01:22:39):
I'm lucky enough because I have a big team. I have someone who helps me schedule my time and I used to goal that person and goal our work together on just being as efficient as possible. But now what I am goaling that person and what we're trying to accomplish here is giving me as much time to develop a first-party point of view. And so what is the most effective way to do that? And for me it is having two to three hour blocks of time where I can actually sit, think, have space, but maybe something that's different about me than other people is its very, very helpful for me to talk to maybe one or two people, not be in a big meeting with 40 people, trusted people.

(01:23:28):
I have an incredible person on my team that I talk to that I think really helps me clarify my thinking. And so to go back to the beginning, just I'm trying to find blocks in my day that I can spend time thinking and also within those blocks, they don't have to be alone time. They can also be scheduling my chief of staff and my head of data to bounce ideas off of as a sounding board because that is the process that I know best for me in terms of really developing a first party perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Such a good tip. It makes sense if you're just spending all your day coordinating in meetings, checking things, reviewing things, you have no time to actually think about what you think is the right move and answer and strategy and next step. And so that's a really good tip. If you're finding that you don't have time to think about what you think is the right solution and the right strategy and the right product decision, fine, just block time to think about this stuff. I have these deep work slots in my calendar. I've written about this a few times where it's three hours and the invite, I don't know if you can do this these days, but it was just, if you book time during the slot, I will slap you. Nobody did.

Naomi Gleit (01:24:42):
That's amazing. And I think for me, some people might need three hours on their own. I think for me, and I don't know about you, talking things through with one or two people really helps me as well. So sometimes it was almost quite challenging for me to think of going into a room by myself for three hours and then I was just going to figure it out on my own. This is like, and I don't know how people help people think strategically the best, but it doesn't have to necessarily be alone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):
That's a great tip. Just have a sparring partner.

Naomi Gleit (01:25:17):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):
Someone who is just interested in exploring ideas and not just have a clear agenda. I love that. Okay, Naomi, I love this tangent we went on as we were wrapping up.

Naomi Gleit (01:25:29):
I know, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:30):
That was amazing. There was a lot of good stuff that we covered there, but I know you have to run. So before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that we haven't covered that you wanted to cover or share?

Naomi Gleit (01:25:42):
Honestly, I think I just did it. I didn't even realize I wanted to talk about that, but it just all came out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):
I love it. I love that. Those are the best nuggets. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Naomi Gleit (01:25:54):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:55):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Naomi Gleit (01:25:59):
I really love narrative nonfiction, so I like the Eric Larson books. They're a very compelling and page turning way to learn about history. I recently read Devil in the White City and there was also one about Churchill's first year by Eric Larson. Another book that just the canonical book that I often recommend is Sapiens. I think he's a great example of what we talk about when we talk about simplifiers. He took a very complex subject, which is all of human history and tried to pull out the nuggets. I think his thesis that what differentiates humans from other forms of life is really our ability to tell and believe in myths or stories, and he cites money and religion as examples, but also there's a graphic novel version of Sapiens and so he almost has the PhD level and then he literally has the high school level, which is a graphic novel version.

(01:26:57):
He also has Unstoppable Us, which I think is a kid's version, and so clearly here is someone who is a master. There's a James Clear thing that a friend, Shirley, told me about where it's like if you're a beginner, you have ignorant simplicity and intermediate has functional complexity, and then a master of a topic has profound simplicity. And that's what I feel like Noah Yuval Harari really has because he can go all the way up and down this cool pyramid in terms of explaining this really complex topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:31):
What I heard about him is that he goes on a one-month meditation retreat every year where it's just him silent meditation retreat, and people ask him, "How do you have time to do that when you have so much work to do?" He's like, "The only way I'm able to achieve these books where I synthesize all of human history into a story is because I do that. Because I can clear my mind and just be."

Naomi Gleit (01:27:53):
And Lenny, to our previous conversation, that is how he himself is best. That's what he needs to do. I might need two to three hours a day and a sparring partner, Noah Yuval Harari needs a month in silent meditation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:07):
Great point. Everyone has their own way of unlocking their brain. On Devil in the White City, a fun fact. When I read that, I was like, "I need to go to Chicago and see the stuff that they wrote about in this book about the World's Fair." And so I went to Chicago and-

Naomi Gleit (01:28:21):
You did?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:22):
Because of that book, yes.

Naomi Gleit (01:28:25):
Wow. Have you read the Splendid in the Vile?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:28):
Yes. That was the-

Naomi Gleit (01:28:29):
Churchill.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:29):
About the Telegram, right? Yeah. Right?

Naomi Gleit (01:28:32):
Oh, no, it was was Churchill's first year, but he has like six books. I haven't read all of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:37):
Okay. I think it was either that one or it was something about a telegram. I did read... It was less good though, is was what I find. I found the Devil in White City was-

Naomi Gleit (01:28:43):
The best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:44):
Was the best. Amazing. Okay, we'll keep going. Second question, do you have a favorite movie or TV show you've recently watched that you really enjoyed?

Naomi Gleit (01:28:52):
We just watched Shogun. I thought it was really good. Have you seen it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
I have, yes. I loved it. Very gruesome but amazing.

Naomi Gleit (01:29:01):
Yeah. I was. I had to cover my eyes for some of it. And then we also, the movie that we just watched was Dune Two. Chris Cox, who's our chief product officer, actually recommended that as one of the best films that he's seen recently, and I really trust his opinion on that. So we caught up by watching Dune One and then watched Dune Two, and it was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:21):
I watched that in IMAX Theater in San Francisco, this insanely large screen and highly would recommend that. I don't think it's still out there. Yeah. [inaudible 01:29:30] ridiculous. Amazing. I think there's another one coming someday.

Naomi Gleit (01:29:34):
Oh yeah, yeah. Dune Three.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:36):
Dune Three. Just keep them coming. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Naomi Gleit (01:29:46):
Well, I'm going to check out that eye mask thing that you recommended, the WAOAW thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:49):
That's it.

Naomi Gleit (01:29:51):
I know it's super expensive, but have you tried the Eight Sleep?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
I have. My wife doesn't love it. She doesn't like the noise. It's like a very slight noise when it starts up, but it wakes her up, so we don't have it anymore.

Naomi Gleit (01:30:07):
And I noticed that too. I think maybe they just released the latest edition. One of the features that is the killer feature for me is that it does a vibrating alarm so that when I wake up at 6:00 A.M., I do not wake up everyone in the house at 6:00 A.M., and so it's a thermal alarm. It makes the bed on my side hotter and it also slightly vibrates underneath my ear to wake me up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):
It's under your ear. I remember vibrating my whole part of the bed. I wonder if that's a new feature.

Naomi Gleit (01:30:37):
Maybe this is like... I'm on version three, maybe there's a version four. I don't know. Maybe that was version one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:43):
Yeah, that's so funny. A nice thing about my life right now is that because I have no meetings or boss, I don't need an alarm.

Naomi Gleit (01:30:52):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:53):
However, it's amazing. However, we have a young kid and he wakes up at 6:00 to 6:30, so that's my alarm usually.

Naomi Gleit (01:30:58):
Oh, and then the other thing I wanted to mention, I don't know if you have this problem, but I'm trying to get a hundred grams of protein every day. I think a lot of my friends and I are focused on protein consumption right now, and so my trainer who helped me actually do the pull-ups and the push-ups started a protein products company called Promix that I really love, and he has this Rice Krispie treat thing that I usually eat every morning and gives me 15 grams of protein.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):
I just bought that.

Naomi Gleit (01:31:32):
What?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:33):
Yes, I was reading, Kevin Rose had his favorite, his health stack, and I don't know if that's the brand, but it's exactly a Rice Krispie thing with 15 grams of protein. So I'm pretty sure that's it.

Naomi Gleit (01:31:45):
I'm pretty sure that's it, because the Rice Krispie part of it is very unique, so let me know what you think. I really like the chocolate chip flavor.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:52):
I hate them and I love them, so that's a really good tip. I just saw a funny TikTok where it's like I never thought when I'd grow up in be an adult, I'd be thinking so often about protein and how much protein I should be eating.

Naomi Gleit (01:32:05):
Maybe this is 40, I don't know. I'm not sure for me, but yes, I've been thinking a lot about protein. The other thing I really like is canned seafood, which has a lot of protein. So something called Fish Wife has, it's just Hipster, like Chicken of the Sea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:23):
Oh yeah, they're very cute. Yes. My wife gets those. Another protein tip, they were a former sponsor, but no longer, but it's an amazing protein tip. Maui Nui venison beef sticks. It's 10 grams of protein and it's a delicious venison beef stick.

Naomi Gleit (01:32:39):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:40):
There we go.

Naomi Gleit (01:32:40):
Look at what we've become Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:45):
Just protein obsessed. It's just going to be so protein rich. Amazing. Okay, what else we got here? Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful in working life?

Naomi Gleit (01:32:56):
Last month we were watching, or I guess two weeks ago, we were watching the US Open and we discovered that as people come through the hallway to come onto the court to play, the players all passed the Billie Jean King sign that says Pressure is Privilege. And I really loved that because I think just with the Teen Accounts launch and just a lot of the more public facing stuff that I have done recently, I do, like we talked about, get nervous, and I think Pressure is Privilege just reminds me that a lot of this stuff is a really incredible opportunity that I have and to be grateful for it. I can still be nervous, but also recognize and be grateful for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):
I love that. Just to remind yourself that you're lucky to be feeling this pressure because that means something is important. Slightly different version of that is Zuck at the event in the Chase Center that you were also at had the shirt that said in Latin-

Naomi Gleit (01:34:02):
Learning through suffering.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:04):
Learning through suffering. Perfect.

Naomi Gleit (01:34:09):
Learning through suffering. I like that one too. I mean, I think he spoke a little bit about this being an entrepreneur is really, really hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:23):
They had the Jensen line about people asked him if he'd start Nvidia again, and his answer was like, "If I knew how insanely hard and stressful this was, I would not." Very, very honest. Okay. Last question. So Charles, your former colleague, told me that you're an incredible surfer-

Naomi Gleit (01:34:42):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:43):
And that you design your life almost around where and when you can go surf.

Naomi Gleit (01:34:47):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:48):
Any story or lesson or I don't know, takeaway from surfing and the impact that's had on you? Lessons about surfing?

Naomi Gleit (01:34:58):
So I think surfing and life have a lot of parallels. It is an incredibly mental sport for me. The biggest thing that I can do to improve my surfing is to improve my confidence. And so when I'm going for a wave, a lot of times I will hesitate or pull back or. Instead, the best thing that you can actually do in that situation is stand up into your fear, is to ride the wave. That is the safest thing you can do. That is the thing that you're actually supposed to do, but on every dimension, that's the right thing. And so it's almost, I guess the motto there is stand up into the fear when you're going, you're about to catch a wave and actually the things that you can do when you're afraid, for example, like I said, pull back or throw your board are actually quite counterproductive and actually unsafe and could lead to more injury. And so it's just another reminder that you really need to commit. Stand up into your fear.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:04):
I love it. Stand up into your fear and pressure is a privilege and learning through suffering. Naomi, this was so much fun. I'm so happy that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you a line? Where they find Naomi-isms, and anything else you want to point folks to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Naomi Gleit (01:36:21):
So believe it or not, I have Naomi.com. I know Boz has Boz.com. I bought that URL, I think maybe 20 years ago, 15 to 20 years ago from a farmer actually whose wife's name was Naomi rather, and his wife was not using it. And so I got it for quite a steal. And I'll just say that I've had other famous Naomis, much more famous and much more well known than I, who would like to have Naomi.com make offers for this URL. But I really like having just a home on the internet where I can put my Naomi-isms. They're also available on Instagram, Naomi Gleit.

(01:37:03):
How can listeners be useful to you? I think Lenny, I mentioned this before we got on the call, I don't tend to do that much public speaking or talking about Naomi-isms. I did some of it two years ago when we first launched but I, as a result of being on the podcast and stuff, would love to do more of this. And so I think any feedback on what listeners would like to see or hear from me, questions that would give me a reason where I felt like it would be useful for me to do more on Naomi-isms would be super helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:37):
Sweet. So if you have any of those, leave them in the YouTube comments is usually the easiest place for folks to leave that. Naomi, thank you so much for being here. This was so much fun.

Naomi Gleit (01:37:45):
Thank you, Lenny.

# How to price your product | Naomi Ionita (Menlo Ventures)

## Transcript

Naomi Ionita (00:00):
Do not set it and forget it. I see companies do this, where they labor over designs and features. And they build this perfect product that's delightful to use. And then pricing's sort of plucked out of thin air, and then they don't revisit it. This was Evernote. It was many, many years before we went back and overhauled the pricing. So, think about your pricing just like you do your roadmap. Every 6 to 12 months, there's probably something meaningful that you're launching for users. So, treat that as an opportunity to revisit your monetization strategy and making sure you're compensated appropriately.

Lenny (00:32):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny. And my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing product. Today, my guest is Naomi Ionita. Naomi was one of the first early leaders in product life growth and monetization, having built early teams and infrastructure over a decade ago at Evernote. She was also an early contributor to Reforge when it was just getting started and helped create some of their early programs. She's also VP of growth at Invoice2go. And currently, she's a full-time VC at Menlo Ventures.

(00:59):
In her work as a full-time investor, she gets to see what works and doesn't work across many companies. And one area that she spends a lot of time on is monetization, when it's best to start charging for your product, how to decide what to charge, and how to evolve your pricing. And that's what we spend the bulk of our conversation around. We also touch on a really interesting framework Naomi has been developing that she calls the Modern Growth Stack, which is essentially all the areas that new starter products can help take the load off your plate and help your product grow. Naomi is awesome, and I'm excited to share this episode with you. With that, I bring you Naomi Ionita right after a word from our wonderful sponsors.

(01:36):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard. But it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track.

(02:10):
You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks. Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's miro.com/lenny.

(02:47):
This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful, and beautifully designed. Not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized, happy team today, again, at notion.com/lennyspod. Naomi, welcome to the podcast.

Naomi Ionita (03:45):
Thank you.

Lenny (03:46):
Did you know that you're one of the very few VCs that I've ever had on this podcast, and so you're basically representing VC kind here? How do you feel about that?

Naomi Ionita (03:54):
Wow. Well, thank you. I think early growth folks like us have a unique bond and a lens on startups and investing. So, my operating background is something I lean on every day and has actually informed a lot of the thesis areas where I spend time now as an investor. So, hopefully, we'll bring it all together in that capacity.

Lenny (04:15):
Awesome. That's exactly what I was just going to say, so I'm glad that you covered that. And so that's a good segue just to... Let's get into your background briefly. Can you talk about some of the wonderful things that you've done in your career both at Reforge, which you'll touch on, and growth stuff, and then your VC life now?

Naomi Ionita (04:29):
Perfect. So, I'm a partner at Menlo Ventures. I focus on early-stage SaaS from seed to series B. I started my career in engineering and consulting before getting into tech back in '06. Fell in love with product. Did some new product development at a big media company before business school. And while at business school, I spent time at the Design Institute at Stanford. So, this was an opportunity to kind of bridge my analytical background with this refreshing view on human-centered design and learning from the founder of IDEO.

(04:56):
So, brought that with me then to Evernote back in 2011, early days over there. I was there from about 10 to 100 million users. And over that arc, I shifted from more of a core product role to starting our growth product function. This was super organic. I started just collaborating with colleagues from across the business, come up with hypotheses, do user research, run experiments, drive metrics. This was a new way of building product back then. This was a decade ago, so the acronym PLG had not been coined yet. And I really just thought of myself as a user and data-driven product person.

(05:33):
After Evernote, I joined a bootstrapped mobile SMB company called Invoice2go. It was the top-grossing business app at the time. There, I built teams across product, data, growth engineering, design and research, and again, focused on product-led growth and monetization. Over those two jobs, I found myself doing a lot more advising and speaking on the side on these topics. And my board members used to farm me out to their companies to help their founders think through things around product growth and pricing and various topics like that. And Reforge came together at the same time, so I would come in and speak on topics through that community. So, that really accelerated my transition into venture. I realized how much I love having that portfolio view of the world and helping founders look around corners. So, I think it's an incredible privilege to get to do the work that I do.

Lenny (06:22):
One thing you mentioned is Evernote. I don't know how much you can talk about this, but they just got sold, right? Someone bought Evernote. And if I think back to Evernote, it feels like they could have been Notion, which is killing it right now. Any thoughts on what maybe they missed and didn't turn into Notion along the way?

Naomi Ionita (06:39):
Yeah. We're going to clear some cobwebs here. It's been a while. But one challenge that Evernote really struggled with was this evolution from single-player to multiplayer to team to enterprise. It's a chasm that a lot of bottom-up SaaS businesses struggle to cross. Evernote was philosophically antisocial. It was meant to be your second brain, kind of your personal tool. And I think that capped the company's growth potential. I always used to say you can't retrofit collaboration. You have to be collaboration-first. And a lot of companies now really take that for granted. But back in mid-2000s, this was kind of a new way of building product. And so we missed that bridge.

(07:20):
If companies do that well, it benefits every metric. That bridge from single-player to multiplayer. Acquisition goes up. You grow organically through referrals and shared workflows. Retention goes up because now you have these shared workflows that are incredibly sticky. Employees are accountable to each other to say, "This is how work gets done." Design in Figma, roadmap planning and ticketing in Jira are linear. It just becomes the default platform. And modernization goes up. Revenue scales with usage. And so the more people using it, the more they use it. You start tripping the wire on paying more and more over time. And so Evernote really struggled in crossing that chasm from the prosumer tool of choice that employees wall-to-wall were using, but never became this larger high-ACV contract from a sales perspective.

Lenny (08:06):
Yeah. It's always easy in hindsight to see what could have been better, what could have worked out, what didn't work out. So, what are you going to do? You mentioned monetization. And I know that you spent a lot of time with founders working on pricing, monetization, especially using monetization as a lever for growth. And so I want to spend some time there to pick your brain about what founders and growth teams can do and how they should think about monetization in terms of growth.

Naomi Ionita (08:06):
Perfect.

Lenny (08:31):
And then you also have this cool concept that you've been developing that you call the Modern Growth Stack, which is kind of this play on modern data stack. And so I want to spend some time there.

Naomi Ionita (08:40):
Perfect.

Lenny (08:40):
Cool. So, to dive into that first topic of monetization, if you think about when you're starting a company, what are some of the biggest challenges you face? Start building a product, especially a B2B product, I always think about pricing and trying to figure out how much to charge, how to charge, your pricing model, how to evolve your pricing, when to charge, all these things. And so I know that you work with founders helping them figure these sorts of things out. And so maybe a first question here is just what do you find startups most often miss or get wrong when they're starting to think about monetization?

Naomi Ionita (09:12):
There's a lot to cover here. I'll cover a few missteps that I think are most common. One is waiting too long to monetize. Another one is underpricing. And this isn't just setting the base price too low, but it's also leaving money on the table by not offering different plans to cater to different segments. And the third one is all too often with pricing, people set it and forget it. So, this idea that when your product development work is never done, neither is your pricing, and you need to combat that along the way. So, those are three areas I think we can cover here.

(09:47):
Maybe starting with one, I can jump right in, I think waiting too long to monetize. The beginning of a startup's journey is all about creating something of value. Right? That's the whole point. Hopefully, founders have some unique market insight or some authenticity around a pain point and some novel solution that's going to change the world. So, that business value is really critical. But the other side of the same coin is being properly compensated for that value as a business. I understand the vulnerability of being a new startup. You just want people to use your product. And I view that early free beta user feedback loop as an R&D cost to make sure you're building the best possible product and that they're driving a lot of value.

(10:28):
But I see companies way too long to make that shift from building a product to building a business. And I think that's the true signal of product-market fit, is ultimately having people open up their wallets and pay you, so looking for people to get to that end goal. And so again, these things aren't mutually exclusive. You're going to create business value, but you're going to be compensated for it and prioritize your roadmap over time so that you're building based on what people actually want and are willing to pay you for.

(10:55):
So, when you don't monetize, I think you're doing yourself a disservice. The things that I see as the pain of leaving money on the table, you're inadvertently cheapening your product. People attribute a lower dollar value or a $0 value to what you've built. You're missing out on critical feedback loops to understand what people are willing to pay. And you're shooting your future self in the foot because this is the other problem, is at some point you're going to start charging, and you're going to experience some backlash. So, it's nice to get ahead of that. A few things to think about, kind of food for thought around delaying and kicking the can down the road from a monetization-

Lenny (11:29):
So, just to reinforce that, your general piece of advice is if you're building a B2B product, start charging immediately. Don't give it away for free. At least have some... You could probably give it away for free but make it clear, "We're going to charge you this much soon." How do you think about that?

Naomi Ionita (11:45):
Yeah, I don't think those are mutually exclusive. So, this isn't to say that I don't like freemium models. Evernote was the darling of freemium over a decade ago. So, I'm still a big believer in that. It's more a question of where you put the paywall. How much do you give up for free? And then how do you price and package a paid version of your product? So, freemium is all about getting that top-of-funnel excitement, getting people to build habit formation. You're collapsing time to value. You're building habit formation. You're building all these champions to use your product. But the idea is to shepherd them along into a paid version of your product and to, again, not delay the idea of, "What should our premium features even be? What should that paid plan even look like?" Again, going back to the misstep at Evernote, I think there was always a premium plan, but it didn't really bridge into enterprise. So, we can talk more about that.

Lenny (12:35):
This is kind of a tangent, I know, because you have these two other pieces of underpricing and setting it and forgetting it. Been talked about, but do you have any advice for deciding what goes into freemium and what-

Naomi Ionita (12:44):
If it gets you to the aha moment, that path to habit formation, that has to be free. That's the core utility of your product. And so the idea is that in that first session or first day, someone's getting to see the delight and saying, "Oh, my God. I'm never going back to the old way. This is how X gets done." If you're looking for some virality or network effect, that's the other thing. Your free users, you might not be getting revenue from, but the idea is that they help you manage CAC. So, these are folks that are driving organic growth for you and helping reduce the incremental cost of your next set of users. So, that's another part of the math equation to think about in giving up revenue.

Lenny (13:23):
You also have this model that you didn't mention that you mentioned in a previous chat we were having offline of this idea of day one versus day 100, stuff people need on day one versus what they need down the road. Do you still believe in that? And what should people know about that?

Naomi Ionita (13:36):
I do believe in that. That was tied to... We had done this experiment at my last company, Invoice2go, where... Typically on the demand curve, the higher you raise the price, the average revenue per user or ARPU, the lower the conversion rate. So, these things are inversely correlated. And we were able to do this rebalancing of our pricing and packaging so that we actually doubled our upgrade rate from our starter plan to our pro plan.

Naomi Ionita (14:00):
... We doubled our upgrade rate from our starter plan to our pro plan while also increasing the price of the pro plan. So, to actually get twice as many people to upgrade while paying something like 30% more for that new plan is pretty rare to get the compounding benefits of that. And what we did was thought a lot about what is a day one premium feature? What is a premium feature that you can get value from the very first time you engage with the product? That's different than your day 100 features. Those are the ones that represent more advanced functionality. Maybe they're ones where the value is derived from having a certain scale of data in the platform.

(14:37):
And so, those you shouldn't waste cognitive load for your users to have to even understand or try to appreciate when they're first getting going. Push those into a more advanced pro version of your product, and monetize them down the road through an upsell. So, big believer in how do you really keep pricing simple? And we've all seen those SaaS pricing pages where there's a laundry list or just a gnarly matrix of features and functionality. So, do what you can to think about that journey for a user and how they're going to continue to increase value with your product over time, and how you can map your pricing and packaging against that journey.

Lenny (15:13):
I really like that framework, because it's so straightforward and simple. As you use it, you'll need more enterprise features innately, because you're sharing it more widely. Your head of security's going to be like, "What are you doing with this thing?" Your finance team's going to be like, "Oh, how do we pay for this thing?" And so, that's a really nice simple way of thinking about what to put in freemium in your free plan versus not. So, glad we touched on that. Okay, so we were going through the three things that companies and founders do wrong when they're starting to price. And so, the first you said was they go too late and I tangentized us, so I'll give it back to you to keep going through this.

Naomi Ionita (15:53):
[inaudible 00:15:53] This is by far the most common issue. And so, one framework I like to use here is matching price to value. When you do that, you create alignment with your user. So, this entails picking the right value metric. So, this is the unit of value that they derive from using your product, and it creates this natural escalator, because as people use it more, you get paid more over time. SaaS was historically built on a seat based model. That's been historical SaaS pricing. And now with the rise of PLG, we've seen more of these usage based approaches gaining speed, so that's pretty exciting to see. Whether it's number of API calls or messages sent or terabytes of storage used or words written, this usage-based approach really matches price to value over the lifetime of a customer. The other thing that happens when you match price to value is it helps you understand who you're building for, and it lets you target different customer segments.

(16:46):
In doing that, you're able to better serve each segment, but you're also able to maximize revenue for the business. Evernote always had a business model. From its beginning, it had $45 a year for an annual subscription. And this set the foundation for the company and tens of millions in revenue, early revenue growth, but the approach was suboptimal. So, as a growth team, we started doing surveys. I was really curious to understand why people converted from our free version to our premium subscription. And one of the most popular answers without fail was, "Well, I just feel guilty. I use it so much. I get so much value from it that I just feel obligated to pay." And take that in for a second, because if guilt is one of the main reasons why people are paying you, then your free version is too good, and you are leaving money on the table.

(17:36):
So, a single premium tier is often a mistake, and you're going to be leaving money on the table for specific segments, and it's important to drill down and understand who those are. Our additional research helped us understand that brand-new users with low perceived value of Evernote looked at it like their Apple Notepad app that was pre-installed on their device. And so, they couldn't understand the idea of paying $45 for Evernote. But then we talked to avid users, and these were people that were cross client using it on desktop and mobile, every device they had. They were using it for work and personal, they were leveraging OCR capabilities and the web clipper, and it was truly their second brain. They could not imagine life without it. And these people were floored that they were only paying $45 a year. They told us that they were getting hundreds of value from Evernote.

(18:28):
Here, the perceived value for avid users was far outpacing what we were asking from them. And this intuition and research really led to a bifurcated strategy of having different plans for different personas based on the value they got from the product and their willingness to pay.

Lenny (18:45):
That makes sense. When I heard you say that it costs $45 for a year, that sounds way too low. So I could see how that sets the pattern for Evernote just not making enough money over the long term. Cool. And then the third was that you don't evolve your pricing, right? That's like the third biggest mistake.

Naomi Ionita (19:03):
Yes. So, do not set it and forget it. I see companies do this where they labor over designs and features, and they build this perfect product that's delightful to use, and then pricing plucked out of thin air, and then they don't revisit it. This was Evernote. It was many, many years before we went back and overhauled the pricing. So, think about your pricing just like you do your roadmap. Every six to 12 months, there's probably something meaningful that you're launching for users. Treat that as an opportunity to revisit your monetization strategy and making sure you're compensated appropriately.

Lenny (19:33):
What advice do you have for founders around just how to decide in your initial price? Clearly Evernote didn't get that correct, and I'm sure you've learned a lot from that and then other companies you've worked with. How do you actually decide what to start charging?

Naomi Ionita (19:45):
Yeah, there's a full pricing process here, so I'm happy to walk through it. The idea here is understanding who your customers are, why they pay you, what is it that they want or value, and how much are they willing to pay you. I'd encourage you to put together a pricing committee. This is not a single-threaded exercise that lives in one department or another. This very much is a cross-functional exercise. If you are a PLG company like companies I worked at, this was the product growth org that I ran. So the combination of PMs and data scientists, folks like that to iterate on pricing. If you are an enterprise SaaS business, of course, sales and finance and rev ops play a role. Think about who that committee should be at your company, and commit to being that cross-functional team that really owns and iterates on pricing over time.

(20:31):
Then, they are responsible for talking to customers. This is by far and away the most basic thing you can do to just increase those feedback loops and understand how much you can push the envelope on pricing. You do that with surveys, with interviews, there's some questions that we like to use around understanding the relative prioritization of features. Going back to that laundry list of features and matrices on a pricing page, it's very rare that people convert equally across all of those features. There's typically one or two that are the main points for conversion. So it's good for you to understand the relative rank there and how to reconcile some of your pricing and packaging accordingly. So, we would make a list of our features that we had and maybe new things we wanted to build and have people rank them as a must-have, nice to have, or not necessary that help us understand the relative prioritization.

(21:23):
You can also get at it with a hundred point question where you give users a hundred points and say, "Spend them across these different features." And the more points you give a feature, the more value you're assigning to it. This is to get to the demand or the features and functionality that you've created. It's step one. It's understanding what people will actually want and making sure that they're not just saying everything but the kitchen sink, but they're actually getting a good sense for what's most important to them. And then the other side is understanding their willingness to pay. I'd say the easiest on-ramps here for companies to start digging into that is to use Van Westendorp's method here. I don't know if you're familiar with that. You're nodding a little bit.

Lenny (22:05):
Yeah. Yeah. Comes up a bunch on this podcast.

Naomi Ionita (22:08):
Oh, great. So I might be repeating myself here, but...

Lenny (22:10):
No, this is great. This is how we learn. We hear it again.

Naomi Ionita (22:13):
If you take the packages that users designated as nice to have and must have, you make that collection of features in the survey, then ask them, "What's such a cheap price that you start to question the quality of the product?" Ask them, "What's a good deal or sounds like the right price for this package?" Ask them, "What's expensive, but they would still pay?" So you're starting to get to that level of discomfort. And then ultimately, "What's prohibitively expensive? What would people just say, 'Okay, that's it.' You've crossed the line of how much I'm willing to pay here." And by plotting those four curves, you start to get a sense of how to inform your pricing. That's a great way to marry the questions around demand and then the questions around willingness to pay.

Lenny (22:52):
Awesome. I wish that survey name was simpler to say, because I can never remember exactly to pronounce it, but you got it. So Van Westendorp.

Naomi Ionita (22:52):
You got it.

Lenny (23:01):
So, say that you got a price, you launched with something. How do you think about and how do you suggest folks experiment with pricing changes? And then, what impact have you seen from making a pricing change, either in terms of revenue or growth? Because I know you work with a lot of startups on these sorts of things, so I'm curious. How big of an impact can you see from pricing changes?

Naomi Ionita (23:22):
Oh, it can be huge. Our friends at OpenView do a really good job of pumping out content and doing these great SaaS benchmarking surveys. They did something recently that showed that roughly half of companies that instituted a pricing change saw at least a 25% increase in ARR. So that's a pretty massive step function improvement in your revenue from something that doesn't require massive technological overhaul. I find that most companies regret not doing it sooner. ProfitWell is another group that I have friends at and have a lot of respect for them and the content that they've put out. They did a survey once on I think it was over 500 SaaS companies, and they looked at for a 1% improvement on acquisition, retention, and monetization, how did it impact a company's bottom line? And they found that the impact with an improvement on monetization was 4X that of acquisition.

(24:13):
So, this idea of how can you efficiently improve your business monetization is really underappreciated as a growth lever. Definitely something people should be thinking about. That's part of my goal of doing this podcast, is making sure founders are compensated in a way that they deserve. So, let's hope everyone makes a little more money after today. And I've seen a lift upwards of 10X on revenue, but it's sometimes hard to parsh just the pricing change, because usually it can be coupled with big product changes, a rebrand, a lot of PR, the launch of a new plan, like a team or an enterprise plan. So, it's hard to sometimes understand just the pricing change in isolation, but it really can be pivotal.

Lenny (24:54):
Cool. And when you think through the pricing changes that you've seen, is the impact often from raising the price just broadly? Is it segmenting more intelligently? Is it changing freemium versus paid? Is there a bucket you think of, like "Here's generally where the biggest impact ends up being?"

Naomi Ionita (25:13):
Yeah, it comes from doing it holistically. I think it's very rarely as impactful if you just pick a new price or just launch a new plan. I really think of it as rebalancing pricing and packaging overall. So it's doing this whole exercise of understanding what people actually want, what their willingness to pay is, and mapping it to that user journey like we talked about from single-player mode to multi-player, that first other person you connect with and have a workflow with, spreading it to your whole teams and ultimately spreading it wall to wall across an organization. So it's a longitudinal view of the user lifecycle and thinking about your whole business model holistically.

Lenny (25:53):
I don't know if you can talk about any of these, but is there a company or an example that comes to mind where you did a pricing change and just talking about what they changed just to make this even more concrete?

Naomi Ionita (26:02):
I have a specific story there with one of our companies, Envoy. This is a fun one. He was just getting started. This is Envoy, the visitor registration tool that I'm sure a lot of people have used, especially before COVID.

Lenny (26:16):
Probably mostly in SF, so I imagine folks in other countries don't know about it. Maybe describe it.

Naomi Ionita (26:20):
Yeah. So, if you visit an office instead of just signing in to that piece of paper in the lobby with your name and your email address and what time you checked in, it is a digital iPad based way of checking in and sharing information with the person you're visiting. And so, in talking to Larry and getting a feel for his evolution around pricing, he tells a story that I love. He was meeting with a big hospitality company, and the conversation was going really well. This prospect was really leaning in and excited about using Envoy, and the conversation shifted to pricing. So in that moment, because Larry was feeling some good vibes, he decided to 10X the price that he was typically charging people. So, just in the moment he decided to just go for it. Go out on a limb, and ask for 10X the typical price.

(27:13):
And in that moment, the exec said, "Okay, sure. Sounds good." Not a minute of hesitation, not a second of hesitation. And what he learned in that moment was that, one, he was wildly underpriced. It was very clear that he hadn't even thought about what the ceiling was. But the truth was he probably could have pushed it even further, considering there was no hesitation. So, what I encourage users to do, especially in these enterprise conversations, is to continue to ask for more, to understand where the upper bound might be, and to understand that it's okay sometimes to lose some deals due to price. Something on the order of 20 to 30% is reasonable so that you can get a sense for where the limit might be. The vast majority of companies are definitely undercharging like we discussed. So, go out on a limb like Larry at Envoy, and you can see that sometimes you can...

Naomi Ionita (28:00):
... like Larry at Envoy and you can see that sometimes you can 2X, 4X, even 10X your price.

Lenny (28:07):
That's an awesome story and it touches on exactly what you said where people often underprice. I imagine it's strategically smarter not to go straight to 10X and maybe go two or three X until people start pushing back because you lose a lot of data there. But that's one way to just zoom to an answer.

Naomi Ionita (28:22):
Yeah, they're all feedback loops, so I think there's some incrementality to it. But you got to understand who these different segments are, and if you don't have enough data points, it's hard to really understand how to continue to optimize.

Lenny (28:33):
Any other tips that you want to leave listeners with around pricing or monetization, or even testing pricing? Anything there before we shift to our second topic?

Naomi Ionita (28:43):
Yes. So we talked a bit about research methods and different surveys you can do to help inform your pricing. And with Enterprise, it's all about continuously asking for more. But if you're a PLG company and you have a public facing pricing page, I'd encourage you to experiment. This is something people shy away from, and frankly, there haven't historically been great tools for companies and infrastructure to be able to do this work.

(29:08):
So at Invoice2go, we invested very heavily in some internal pooling. We had a whole metering and human management and experimentation system in-house. It was a big growth engineering undertaking. And with that we tested different value metrics. We tested different quota limits, price points, promotions, you name it. We tracked the consumption of our pay as you go model and looped that back into the product so we can nudge users along the lifecycle to get them to convert, or upgrade or renew, once quota limits were reached.

(29:38):
So there's a lot there. I'm excited about this new wave of modern tools to actually help you do this and not sync a bunch of engineering time into building something in-house. So that's something we can talk about in a bit. But that investment was very worthwhile. We had huge revenue gains by being able to iterate in a way that was more streamlined.

(29:57):
There's some things to watch out for though. It's hard to test pricing. There's a lot of different variables to isolate. So you've got to make sure you're bringing a consistent test experience to the in product experience, your pricing page, maybe mobile app stores or lifecycle emails that you're sending.

(30:14):
One trick you can do is we would segment these tests by geo. So we would do some tests in Canada or Australia before rolling out in the US. That was a nice way to just put some constraints around our experimentation.

(30:28):
And the other thing you really have to think about is the long-term nature of pricing experimentation. So knowing if you succeeded and failed often requires understanding the implications on churn. Let's say part of your test is year one discount. You need to understand how users perform in year two and have a sense of the trade-offs around user growth, retention, ARPU. So all of these things are different levers that you want to optimize over time.

Lenny (30:56):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(31:35):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today.

(32:13):
There's a question I wanted to ask you, and maybe it's too big of a question to answer simply, but it's this question you just raised of trading off revenue versus growth. That's one of the most common trade-offs founders have to make. Do you have any just general thoughts, advice there? Is there one you should generally index on? What have you seen works best? Which kind of direction should you lean, growth or revenue, for your, let's say, B2B company? Like early stage?

Naomi Ionita (32:40):
Yeah, if you know that you have a bridge to move up market, then giving up the long tail of individual users can be very worthwhile.

(32:50):
So I think Figma is a great example of that. This was a company that took a while to monetize. And even having free usage at the individual level, that was the way to just drive insane community and love for this product. Designers around the world just fell for this product overnight. But this idea that once they were using it in a more corporate setting, once they were collaborating with more people across the business, they were tripping a wire to pay. And so what happened there was you had this massive top of funnel of individual users, but knowing that design is inherently collaborative, you're interfacing with engineers, you're interfacing with PMs, with marketers, with researchers, with execs, more than half of Figma users weren't even designers once it was embedded in the enterprise. And so this idea of these compounded growth loops that you got by interfacing with so many different parts of the company and making design truly collaborative and in the browser, they were able to just have this exponential curve on monetization once they shifted into more of a team or enterprise based package.

(33:54):
So that's a good example of saying, they were willing to trade off on monetizing the individual because they knew that it would be so sticky and would go so wall to wall within a company.

Lenny (34:05):
Got it. So your feeling is if it's a multiplayer PLG-ish product, you probably want to optimize for growth. Let it just take over and not go charge as much as you can immediately, versus say like a sales led B2B enterprise-y product, maybe they're focused on revenue immediately versus making it feel cheap. Is that right?

Naomi Ionita (34:27):
And I think if you do have a few free users, crafting it as more of a sweetheart discount, like more of a year one discount, but getting paid over time. I mean, again, I am a big believer in having some early users being your design partners and really giving you that tight feedback loop to make sure you're building the right product. So it's not that you should really optimize for revenue on day one. I mean, it is a journey, but I just oftentimes see companies just take too long. Or in Evernote's case, I mean the free version was just too good. So that's just something to consider, where to put the paywall and be really, really strategic about that.

Lenny (35:02):
Just don't optimize for guilt in your paid driver.

(35:07):
So you're talking about pricing testing and I was going to ask what tools you found that are useful for testing pricing. And that's probably a good segue to talking about the modern growth stack. Would that fit into this concept of modern growth stack, testing your pricing?

Naomi Ionita (35:21):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (35:22):
Okay, let's do it. So just to set it up, there's this term modern data stack that I think it'd be useful for you to explain because not everyone is aware of that, and you've kind of been thinking more about this adjacent idea of a modern growth stack. So can you just talk about these two things, and then we'll lead to some questions there?

Naomi Ionita (35:37):
So the modern data stack is basically a collection of cloud native tools to more easily move and manage data. It consists of a fully managed ELT, data pipeline, a destination for that data. So a cloud-based data warehouse, like a Snowflake or Redshift, data transformation tool like DBT, and then finally a platform for visualization on top, so people can access the data. The play on modern data stack was very intentional. I think of the modern growth stack, or my core thesis area right now at Menlo, as the evolution of what you do with the data. So these are the workflows that the data enables to drive the business forward for product growth and revenue teams like I used to run. It's the modern replacement for infrastructure that teams like mine built or bought. When you're responsible for driving things like activation or monetization or retention, there tends to be a lot of these internal tools that are built because you're really powering cross-functional teams to do this work. It's not mapped easily into legacy departments.

Lenny (36:39):
Awesome. And the general idea here is, there's so many more tools now to help you grow with the data stack. There's just all these tools now that make it so much easier to collect data, use data, make decisions off data, and you're finding the same things happening with growth. What are some of the tools that you found to be super helpful? I know you're an investor in some, you're not a investor in others. It'd be good to just talk about, here's just like a bunch of cool tools and how do they fit together as much as possible to help you grow your startup.

Naomi Ionita (37:05):
And I want to reinforce some different themes before I get into some layers of the stack because I think it's important to frame the benefits of the modern growth stack. So one is data, two is workflow, and three is impact.

(37:18):
So starting with data, the modern growth stack companies really are powered by these smart integrations and the automation that you get as a result. So with this proliferation of SaaS, it's created this need for more data access and interoperability. We've all felt that pain of siloed data. Modern growth stack companies leverage reverse ETL companies, like Hightouch or Census, to break down these silos and help companies, or employees across the company, access data and be more productive. So that's a big data theme with modern growth stack companies.

(37:49):
The other theme that they unlock is around workflow. Here, it's really the enablement of people and process. So rather than employees sitting in their departmental silos, modern growth stack companies build bridges between them. So by unlocking data access, the business side can often self-serve and be more self-sufficient without relying on an engineer or a data scientist to run queries or stitch together data sets for them.

(38:16):
The other thing here is lots of growth work is inherently cross functional. So the efforts to drive growth requires new tools and collaborative workflows like we're discussing. Without purpose-built software, many teams like mine felt no choice but to build in-house. So we spent sacred hours building and maintaining tooling for experimentation, personalization, billing, monetization. These were resources that could have been reallocated to building proprietary features for the business had we been able to buy something purpose-built.

(38:50):
And finally, these products really drive impact. So the idea here is driving hard ROI in the form of cost reduction. So automation means time savings, and oftentimes, that can be mapped directly to cost reduction for a company. But they also help product and growth and go to market teams better engage and monetize customers. So they're driving hard ROI in the form of revenue impact too. I'm really compelled by companies that can drive hard ROI both across cost saving and revenue generation. And I think that ROI story is even more compelling now in a softer macroeconomic climate. You just have to be able to continue to retain sales and pricing power, and I think that's derived from a strong ROI story like I described.

(39:35):
So those are general themes and consistencies across the companies that I get particularly excited about. So happy to talk about a few layers in the stack, and I think you might be familiar with a few of these as well, especially based on your growth background at Airbnb and tools that you probably build yourself.

Lenny (39:54):
Yeah, exactly. That's what I was going to say, that so many of these things are just coming out of startups that have built these in-house. And then they're just like, "Hey, I could start a company doing this and provide it to all these other companies." And so I just love that there's all these tools coming out that just make it easier to build startups and grow startups, and do less work, and have less people. Just reminds me of the number one app in the App Store at this point. I don't know if it still is Gas, which is just like four people, and it's higher than TikTok and YouTube, and all the things, and Facebook, and it's four people. And so it just shows you the power of what tools can do for you to build new startups and disrupt people, and companies that have been around for a long time.

Naomi Ionita (40:33):
And you have to help companies do more with less now. There's a lot of frozen budgets and that's a good way to break through. So I love that these companies can do that for the buyer.

(40:44):
So one that's come up a bit and gotten a lot of airtime recently is product-led sales. This idea of companies that serve PLG businesses and harness the power of all that product usage data to inform the customer facing team around which accounts are most upgradable. It's really free money when you shine a light on an account that nobody was paying attention to and some inside sales team can drive a large account expansion. So I don't know what better ROI you should get than that.

(41:14):
And there's a bunch of companies that are doing this. Endgame happens to be one that I work with. They have customers like Figma, Loom, Calendly. There's other players too. I think Pocus has done a phenomenal job of building content and community to help inform the market around the power of product led sales. So there's just a lot of goodness about all the players in this space really waking everyone up to this opportunity of layering on sales to a product led motion and how to maximize revenue along the way.

Lenny (41:45):
I'm an investor in both of those actually, and I'm going to, just in the show notes, note the one I'm an investor in because I'm investor in a lot of these companies, it turns out. And we've invested in a few, so I'm just going to keep it simple and I'll write in the show notes. Here's ones I'm an investor, just to avoid.

Naomi Ionita (41:59):
I love that. Double- dipping means you're a believer in the category as well.

Lenny (42:03):
I am.

Naomi Ionita (42:00):
... tipping means you're a believer in the category as well.

Lenny (42:03):
I am. I love it. There's so much school stuff happening there and I'm really excited. Yeah.

Naomi Ionita (42:08):
Yep. Cool. I think another layer in the stack is experimentation. So this is really critical infrastructure, in my opinion, for these cross-functional product data growth teams to A/B test hypotheses and understand their impact on the business. How do you know if you make a change in the product or your pricing, whether you succeeded or failed without having infrastructure like this along the way? Category creators like Optimizely really paved the way. I was an early buyer of Optimizely and they targeted marketing personas, and it was just game changing to be able to start to A/B test things and bring hypotheses to life.

(42:44):
I'm also biased as an investor, but some of the modern tools here, like Eppo, which offers experimentation for the modern data stack. So unlike Optimizely, which focused on more kind of click through metrics, Eppo ties directly to the metrics in your data warehouse. So tying an experiment result to things like subscriptions or revenue or margins, really like board level metrics that you're trying to move. They make that full trip really convenient and understand the impact on those business KPIs directly. So it's a lot of automation around the experimentation, results. And analysis they used to live off to the side in Excel or Jupyter Notebooks now is automated away with Eppo. I think you're familiar with that one.

Lenny (43:29):
Yeah, we definitely didn't plan this, but Eppo's both a happy sponsor of this podcast. I'm also an investor in Eppo. Go Eppo, but this was not planned.

Naomi Ionita (43:38):
Well, this is Airbnb roots. [inaudible 00:43:41].

Lenny (43:40):
Love it. It is. Yeah. It's my colleague.

Naomi Ionita (43:42):
[inaudible 00:43:42] was an early data scientist at Airbnb.

Lenny (43:45):
Exactly, I worked with him at Airbnb and he was amazing and I had to invest in anything that he built. He built an awesome thing.

Naomi Ionita (43:49):
Yeah, but exactly like you describe, I love these founders that have steep authenticity around the problem because they built it internally and now they're commercializing it for the masses. And so the story of chain Eppo is a good one on that dimension. And there's other players too. I'm also a big fan of Amplitude and a buyer of that tool as well, and I love a lot of the team there. So if you do not have a data team or a data warehouse and you still want to leverage being able to do behavioral kind of ad hoc analysis or experimentation, that's a great tool for you as well. So a lot of different ways to solve this problem in the market.

Lenny (44:22):
Also, a happy sponsor, go Amplitude.

Naomi Ionita (44:25):
Cool.

Lenny (44:26):
I love it. This is great. Hitting on all my favorites. Okay, let's keep going. What else have we got?

Naomi Ionita (44:32):
Well, I talked a lot about billing and monetization, so I'd have to talk about that one. I think platforms for managing, billing and iterating on your pricing and packaging, this is just such a big need. I think these will transform business models. For SaaS in particular, most companies have been seat-based like we described, so the historical incumbents like a [inaudible 00:44:54] really serve that model. But in this shift to more usage based, there's new entrants that are servicing companies in that dimension. And there's also lots of sort of clunky workflows when you think of bridging from engineering to product and growth to finance or RevOps.

(45:11):
So there's a lot of just streamlined workflow that these new tools can offer. Some early breakout players in the world of usage-based billing are Metronome and Orb. There's also more room to handle the full monetization infra-layer. So for example, I like how Orb marries the billing component with the data infrastructure to actually inform what your pricing and packaging iteration should be and help you forecast and optimize revenue. So there's other players that are doing different components from this journey of the metering piece all the way through to the experimentation piece, and it's been really, really fun to get to know players in that space. And I wish I could have been a buyer of them many moons ago.

Lenny (45:57):
Not an investor in these yet. And so that's cool. Quick tangent, do you have a strong opinion on pricing models, usage based versus seed based versus something else? What's your guidance to founders? Is this the way to go, usually one of them, or is it super dependent? What do you recommend?

Naomi Ionita (46:12):
Yes, this is a similar answer I had before. I don't think that they're mutually exclusive. And so if you look at all the companies that in different pricing models in SaaS, a small sliver less than 10%, around roughly 5% have just pure natural escalator kind of usage-based model. The vast majority have a hybrid approach. And so what I mean by that is they're typically some good, better, best subscription model where there's some consumption component across each tier, like some quota limit for your given value metric. So in Slack there might have been number of messages sent or Dropbox number of terabytes of storage. Invoice2go might be number of invoices. There's some dimension that's been sort of packaged in with a given pricing plan, and once you reach that limit, it is a trigger to get you to upgrade to the next plan over, or sometimes there's overages that you can pay for.

(47:02):
So I don't believe that you should just be seat-based or just be usage-based. I think one challenge with purely usage-based models is that's not always how CFOs want to buy. I think buyers sometimes want predictability. They want to be able to budget for your tool, and I've lived that. I remember using tools like Mixpanel and Segment and even Jira to an extent where I was paying a cheap amount to get going, and all of a sudden I realized we had grown quickly and I looked at all of our SaaS spend and I was blown away by how much more we were paying. So it's the other side of this... I'm advocating for people getting paid and compensated for the value that they're delivering, but there can be a breaking point. And so how do you think about packaging a fixed and variable component so that people can more predictably buy your software?

Lenny (47:48):
Any other layers of the stack that you want to touch on slash which would you be most excited about in the future? Do you think people should be paying more attention to that maybe they're not paying attention to?

Naomi Ionita (47:57):
I mean, I wouldn't be doing my job as a VC if I didn't mention Generative AI right now. It's really having a moment. So there's a bunch of breakout applications there that sit within this theme of the modern growth stack. When you think of using AI to create images or text or code or audio or video, these capabilities change the way teams work. So writing a blog or writing copy for an ad, SDR is doing their work and can outbound sales efforts. There's just a lot of these touchpoints where it's humans kind of tinkering and iterating and laboring over every word. And if the machine, if AI can tell you what's going to be a more performant version of something, that's a very, very hard ROI exercise there. You save time and hopefully you've improved your performance across the various marketing or sales campaign.

Lenny (48:48):
Where do you think AI will be the most help on growth in terms of growth? Do you have an idea there?

Naomi Ionita (48:54):
I think what I described around marketing and sales, just because they really touch the dollars. It can be this ROI story around saving time, but also driving revenue. There'll be plenty of really effective examples within things like customer support. I mean the cost savings potential. There's going to be massive. We'll see what happens in engineering, which generating code. I think there's a lot of areas where it is going to touch the enterprise, but from a modern growth stack standpoint, I think something that's really revenue generating and can point to attributable ROI on that dimension is going to be pretty relevant to where I'm spending time right now.

Lenny (49:32):
I'm excited. Any last thoughts before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Naomi Ionita (49:37):
I'm happy to hand it over to the lightning round here.

Lenny (49:40):
Well, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. I'm only going to have four questions for you. I'm going to ask them pretty quick. We'll go through them fast, whatever comes to mind. No pressure. Question one, what are a couple books that you've recommended most to other people?

Naomi Ionita (49:56):
My buddy Madhavan from Simon Kucher's wrote a book called Monetizing Innovation. This is a great read. He and others there have done pricing engagements with hundreds of tech companies, so there's a lot of stories and practical tips there. I often gift that one to founders, so I can't do this whole talk without giving a nod to my friend, Madhavan, and his bible.

Lenny (50:19):
Awesome. I just recorded an episode with Madhavan, and so that's a great pick. Question number two, favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Naomi Ionita (50:28):
I have little kids, so I don't know if this is going to be as interesting for folks, but we like Story Bots on Netflix. They're these little cartoon characters that answer kids questions. So people sort of call in and ask questions and they do a whole episode on why is the sky blue? How do airplanes fly? How do I see? And I inevitably learned something from watching those. So those are very kind of playful and educational shows. I critically need a new-

Lenny (51:00):
No, those are... I don't know the answer to any of those questions. I need to watch this. Okay, so question three. I'm looking at my notes and I've never asked this question before, so I don't know where this came from, but I love it. Who's been the biggest inspiration to you in your life?

Naomi Ionita (51:14):
I mean, this one's pretty easy. For me, it's my parents. They're from South America originally and lived on three different continents before immigrating to the US for graduate school. It's a pretty cliché American dream, but they came here with nothing. Just this idea of building a family and taking advantage of the educational and professional opportunities in America. They progressed through school and building their career in three different languages with no financial support, no entrenched kind of resources or networks to lean on, and I just can't imagine doing that. Just the stress or cognitive load of kind of restarting your life in whole new geographies and cultures and languages and just betting on yourself and figuring it all out along the way. So my drive has always been rooted in their story and I'm forever indebted to them.

Lenny (52:03):
I need to ask this question more often. That was an amazing answer on the spot. Naomi, we have reached the end of our chat. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, maybe pitch you startup ideas, contact you if they want to ask you questions, and then finally, how can folks be useful to you?

Naomi Ionita (52:23):
I'm a partner at Menlo Ventures, so you can find more about me in the firm at menlovc.com or else on LinkedIn or Twitter. My DMs are open.

Lenny (52:33):
Amazing. Naomi, thank you so much for being here.

Naomi Ionita (52:35):
My pleasure. I look forward to talking to more folks who are building things across workflow automation, data AI, and the modern growth stack. So thank you. It's always a pleasure.

Lenny (52:48):
All right, DMs are coming in as we speak.

Naomi Ionita (52:50):
Thanks, Lenny.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart. Now, you're the PM of the most consequential product in history.

Nick Turley (00:00:05):
I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab. My first task was I fix the blinds, or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
When someone offers you a rocket ship, don't ask which seat.

Nick Turley (00:00:13):
We set out to build a super assistant. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What was it called before?

Nick Turley (00:00:17):
It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be a successful product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
And then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it."

Nick Turley (00:00:23):
This is a pattern with AI, you won't know what to polish until after you ship. My dream is that we ship daily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
By the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5.

Nick Turley (00:00:31):
About 10% of the world population uses every week. With scale comes responsibility. It just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human. This model has taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):
Kevin Weil, your CPO, said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?"

Nick Turley (00:00:43):
I just really want to jump to the punchline, "Why can't we do this now?" I always felt like part of my role here is to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Everyone is always wondering, "Is Chat the future of all of this stuff?"

Nick Turley (00:00:52):
Chat was the simplest way to ship at that time. I'm baffled by how much it took off, even more baffled by how many people have copied.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter.

Nick Turley (00:01:02):
That is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive. I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):
Can you give us a peek into where this goes long-term?

Nick Turley (00:01:09):
ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS. We haven't built Windows yet, and it will be obvious once we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today, my guest is Nick Turley. Nick is Head of ChatGPT at OpenAI. He joined the company three years ago, when it was still primarily a research lab. He helped come up with the idea of ChatGPT and took it from 0 to over 700 million weekly active users, billions in revenue, and arguably the most successful and impactful consumer software product in human history. Nick is incredible. He's been very much under the radar. This is the first major podcast interview that he has ever done, and you are in for a treat. We talk about all the things, including the just launched GPT-5.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:31):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:34):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:41):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names, like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain, start and scale their security programs, and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:20):
That is very much our experience, but before the company, and some extent, during it, but the idea is, with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:36):
We appreciate you for doing that, and you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's vanta.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:50):
Thank you!

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Nick, thank you so much for joining me, and welcome to the podcast.

Nick Turley (00:04:59):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:00):
I already had a billion questions I wanted to ask you, and then you guys decided to launch GPT-5 the week that we're recording this. So, now, I have at least 2 billion questions for you. I hope you have a lot of time. First of all, just congrats on the launch. It's coming tomorrow, the day after recording this. Just congrats. How are you feeling? I imagine this is an ungodly amount of work and stress. How are you doing?

Nick Turley (00:05:22):
It's a busy week, but we've been working on this for a while, so it also feels really good to get it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):
So, by the time people hear this, they're going to have their hands on GPT-5, the newest ChatGPT. What's the simplest way to just understand what this is, what it unlocks, what people can do with it? Give us the pitch.

Nick Turley (00:05:39):
I'm so excited about GPT-5. I think for most people, it's going to feel like a real step change. If you're the average ChatGPT user, and we have 700 million of them this week, you've probably been on GPT-4o for a while. You probably don't even think about the model that powers the product. And GPT-5, it just feels categorically different. I'll talk about a lot of the specifics, but at the end of the day, the vibes are good, at least we feel that way. We hope that users feel the same. And increasingly, that is the thing that I think most people notice, right? They don't look at the academic benchmarks. They don't look at evaluations. They try the model and see what it feels like. And just on that dimension alone, I'm so excited. I've been using it for a while, but it is also the smartest, most useful, and fastest frontier model that we've ever launched.

(00:06:33):
On pure SMARTs, one way to look at that is academic benchmarks on many of the standard ones, whether or not it's math, or reasoning, or just raw intelligence. This model is state of the art. I'm especially excited about its performance on coding, whether or not that's SWE-bench, which is a common benchmark, or actually front-end coding is really, really good as well, and that's an area where I feel like there's the true step change improvement in GPT-5. But really, no matter how you measure the SMARTs, it's quite remarkable, and I think people are going to feel the upgrade, especially if they weren't using o3 already.

(00:07:13):
And the second thing beyond SMARTs is it's just really useful. Coding is one axis of utility, whether or not you have coding questions or you're vibe coding an app, but it's also a really good writer. I write for a living, internally, externally. I just wrote a big blog post that we published Monday, and this thing is such an incredible editor. And compared to some of the older models, it's got taste, which I think is really exciting. And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model. And it just feels a little bit more alive, a bit more human in a way that is hard to articulate until you try it. So, feel good about that.

(00:08:06):
And yeah, as mentioned, it's faster. It thinks, too, just like o3 did, but you don't have to manually tell it to do that. It'll just dynamically decide to think when it needs to. And when it doesn't need to think, it just responds instantly, and that ends up feeling quite a bit faster than using o3 did. And then maybe the thing that's most exciting is that we're making it available for free, and that's one of those things that I feel like we can uniquely do at OpenAI. Because many companies, I think, if they have a subscription model like us, they would gate it behind their paid plan. And for us, if we can scale it, we will, and that just feels awesome. We did that with 4o as well. So, everyone is going to be able to try GPT-5 tomorrow, hopefully.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):
How long does something like this take? I don't know if there's a simple answer to this, but just how long have you guys been working on GPT-5?

Nick Turley (00:08:51):
We've been working on it for a while. You can view GPT-5 as a culmination of a bunch of different efforts. We had a reasoning tech, we had a more classic post-screening methodologies, and therefore, it's really hard to put a beginning on it, but it really is the end point of a bunch of different techniques that we began for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:14):
Can you give us a peek into the vision for where ChatGPT is going, GPT in general is going? If you look at on the surface, it's been the same idea with a much smarter brain for a long time. I'm curious where this goes long-term.

Nick Turley (00:09:28):
So, to maybe back up a bit, now, you think of ChatGPT as, "Is this going to be ubiquitous product?" Again, about 10% of the world population uses every week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:37):
Holy shit.

Nick Turley (00:09:39):
I think we have 5 million business customers now. It's an established category in its own right. But really, when we started, we set out to build a super assistant, that's how we talked about it at the time. In fact, the code base that we use is called SA Server. It was supposed to be a hackathon code base, but things always turn out a little bit differently. So, yeah, in some ways, that is still the vision. The reason I don't talk about it more than I do is because I think assistant is a bit limiting in terms of the mental model we're trying to create. You think of this very personified human thing, maybe utilitarian, maybe a... And frankly, having an assistant is not particularly relatable to most people, unless they're in Silicon Valley and they're a manager, or something like that. So it's imperfect.

(00:10:24):
But really, what we envision is this entity that can help you with any task, whether or not that's at home, or at work, or at school, really any context, and it's an entity that knows what you're trying to achieve. So, unlike ChatGPT today, you don't have to describe your problem in menu to detail because it already stands your overarching goals and has context on your life, et cetera. So, that's one thing that we're really excited about. The inverse of giving it more inputs on your life is giving it more action space. So, we're really excited to allow it to do, over time, what a smart, empathetic human with a computer could do for you. And I think the limit of the types of problems that you can solve for people, once you give it access to tools like that, is very, very different than what you might be able to do in a chatbot today. So, that's more outputs.

(00:11:19):
And I often think, "Okay, I'm a general intelligence. What happened if I became Lenny's intern, or something?" And I wouldn't be particularly effective despite having both of those attributes that I just mentioned, and it's because I think this idea of building a relationship with this technology is also incredibly important. So, that's maybe the third piece that I'm excited about is building a product that can truly get to know you over time. And you saw us launch some of those things with improved memory earlier this year, and that's just the beginning of what we're hoping to do so that it really feels like this is your AI. So, I don't know if supersystem is still the right exact analogy, but I think people just think of it as their AI. And I think we can put one in everyone's pocket and help them solve real problems, whether or not that's becoming healthy, whether or not that's starting a business, whether or not that's just having a second opinion on anything. There's so many different problems that you can help with people in their daily life, and that's what motivates me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
So an interesting between the lines that I'm reading here is the vision is for it to be an assistant for people not to replace people. It feels like a really important piece of the puzzle. Maybe just talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:12:29):
AI is really scary to people, and I understand there's decades of movies on AI that have a certain mental model baked in. And even if you just look at the technology today, everyone, I think, has this moment where the AI does something that was really deeply personal to them and you're thought, "Hey, AI can never do that." For me, it was weird music theory things where I was like, "Wow, this thing actually understands music better than I do," and that's something I'm passionate about. And so it's naturally scary. And I think the thing that's been really important to us for a long time is to build something that feels like it's helpful to you, but you're in the driver's seat, and that's even more important as the stuff becomes agentic, the feeling of being in control, and that can be small things.

(00:13:15):
We built this way of watching what the AI is doing when it's in agent mode. And it's not that you actually are going to watch it the whole time, but it gives you a mental model and makes you feel in control in the same way that, when you're in a Waymo, you get that screen, for those of you who've tried Waymo. You can see the other cars. It's not like you're going to actually watch, but it gives you the sense that you know how this thing works and what's happening, or we always check with you to confirm things. It's a little bit annoying, but it puts you in the driver's seat, which is important. And for that reason, we always view technology and the technology that we build as something that amplifies what you're capable of, rather than replacing it, and that becomes important as the deck gets more powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:53):
Okay. So you mentioned the beginnings of ChatGPT. I was reading in a different interview. So you joined OpenAI. ChatGPT was just this internal experimental project that was basically a way to test GPT-3.5, and then Sam Altman is just like, "Hey, let me tweet about it, maybe see if people find this interesting," yada yada, yada. It's the most successful consumer product in history, I think both in growth rate in users and revenue, and just absurd. Can you give us a glimpse into that early period before it became something everyone is obsessed with?

Nick Turley (00:14:24):
Yeah. So we had decided that we wanted to do something consumer-facing, I think, right around the time that GPT-4 finished training, and it was actually mainly for a couple of reasons. We already had a product out there, which was our developer product. That's actually what I came in to help with initially, and that has been amazing for the mission. In fact, it's grown up. And now, it's the OpenAI platform with, I don't know, 4 million developers, I think. But at that time, it was early stage, and we were running into some constraints with it because there was two problems. One, you couldn't iterate very quickly because, every time you would change the model, you'd break everyone's app. So, it was really hard to try things.

(00:15:03):
And then the other thing was that it was really hard to learn because the feedback we would get was the feedback from the end user to the developer to us. So it was very disintermediated, and we were excited to make fast progress towards AGI and it just felt like we needed a more direct relationship with consumers. So we were trying to figure out where to start. And in classic OpenAI fashion, especially back then, we put together a hackathon of enthusiasts of just hacking on GPT-4 to see what awesome stuff we could create and maybe ship to users, and everyone's idea was some flavor of a super assistant. They were more specific ideas, like we had a meeting bot that would call into meetings, and the vision was maybe it would help you run the meeting over time. We had a coding tool, which full circle now, probably ahead of its time. And the challenge was that we tested those things, but every time we tested these more bespoke ideas, people wanted to use it for all this other stuff because it's just a very, very generically powerful technology.

(00:16:04):
So, after a couple of months of prototyping, we took that same crew of volunteers, and it was truly a volunteer group, right? We had someone from the supercomputing team who had built an iOS app before. We had someone on the research team who had written some backend code in their life. They were all part of this initial ChatGPT team, and we decided to ship something open-ended because we just wanted a real use case distribution. And this is a pattern with AI, I think, where you really have to ship to understand what is even possible and what people want, rather than being able to reason about that a priori. So, ChatGPT came together at the end because we just wanted the learnings as soon as we could, and we shipped it right before the holiday thinking we would come back and get the data and then wind it down. And obviously, that part turned out super differently because people really liked the product as is.

(00:16:56):
So I remember going through the motions of like, "Oh, man, dashboard is broken. Oh, wait, people are liking it. I'm sure it's just going viral and stuff is going to die down," to like, "Oh, wow, people are retaining, but I don't understand why." And then eventually, we fell into product development mode, but it was a little bit by accident.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):
Wow. I did not know that ChatGPT emerged out of a hackathon project. Definitely the most successful hackathon project.

Nick Turley (00:17:21):
I like to tell this story when we do our hackathons because I really do want people to feel like they can ship their idea, and it's certainly been true in the past, and we'll continue to make it true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):
If you don't want to share these things, but I wonder who that team was.

Nick Turley (00:17:34):
The team is largely still around. Some of the researchers working on GPT-5, actually, were always part of the ChatGPT team. Engineers are still around. Designers are still around. I'm still here, I guess. So, yeah, you've got the team still running things, but obviously, we've grown up tremendously, and we've had to because with scale comes responsibility. And we're going to hit a billion users soon and you have to begin acting in a way that is appropriate to that scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
Okay. So let me spend a little time there. So, I don't know if this is 100% true, but I believe it is that ChatGPT is the fastest growing, most successful consumer product in history. Also, the most impactful on people's lives. It feels like it's just part of the ether of society now. It's just my wife talks to it. Every question I have, I go to it, voice mode. My wife is just like, "Let me check with ChatGPT." It's just such a part of our life now, and I think it's still early. So many people don't even know what the hell is going on. Just as someone leading this, do you ever just take a moment to reflect and think about just like, "Holy shit"?

Nick Turley (00:18:45):
I have to. It's quite humbling to get to run a product like that, and I have to pinch myself very frequently, and I also have to sometimes sit back and just think, which is really hard when things are moving so quickly. I love setting a fast pace at the company, but in order to do that with confidence, I need at least one day every week that I'm entirely unplugged and I'm just thinking about what to do and process the week, et cetera.

(00:19:14):
And the other thing is I've never ever worked on a product that is so empirical in its nature where, if you don't stop, and watch, and listen to what people are doing, you're going to miss so much, both on the utility and on the risks, actually. Because normally, by the time you ship a product, you know what it's going to do. You don't know if people are going to like it, that's always empirical, but you know what it can do. And with AI, because I think so much of it is emergent, you actually really need to stop and listen after you launch something and then iterate on the things people are trying to do and on the things that aren't quite working yet. So, for that reason alone, I think it's very important to take a break and just watch what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):
Okay. So you take a day off every week... not off. Okay, that's not the right way to put it. You take a day of thinking time, deep work.

Nick Turley (00:20:12):
I need it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I need to hard unplug on a Saturday, or something like that. Obviously-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
On a Saturday [inaudible 00:20:16].

Nick Turley (00:20:16):
But it's just not possible otherwise. This has been a giant marathon for three years now. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Like a sprint marathon.

Nick Turley (00:20:26):
Sprint marathon, that's right, or interval training, or something. I don't know how to exactly describe the OpenAI launch cadence, but you've got to set yourself up in a way that is sustainable. Even if this wasn't AI and it didn't have the interesting attributes that I just mentioned, I think you would need to do that. But especially with AI, it's important to go watch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
So, along those lines, I talked to a bunch of people that work with you, that work at OpenAI. Joanne specifically said that urgency and pace are a big part of how you operate, that that's just something you find really important, to create urgency within the team constantly, even when you are the fastest growing product in history, growing like crazy. Talk about just your philosophy on the importance of pace and urgency on teams.

Nick Turley (00:21:08):
Well, it's nice of her to say that. Two things, with ChatGPT, when we decided to do it, we had been prototyping for so long and I was just like, "In 10 days, we're going to ship this thing," and we did. So, that was maybe a moment in time thing where I just really wanted to make sure that we go learn something. Ever since then, I spent so much time thinking about why ChatGPT became successful in the first place, and I think there was some element of just doing things where there was many other companies that had technology in the LLM space that just never got shipped. And I just felt like, of all the things we could optimize for, learning as fast as possible is incredibly important. So I just started rallying people around that, and that took different forms.

(00:21:55):
For a while, when we were of that size, I just ran this daily release sync and had everyone who was required to make a decision in it, and we would just talk about what to do and to pivot from yesterday, et cetera. Obviously, at some point, that doesn't scale, but I always felt like part of my role here, obviously, was to think about the direction of the product, but also to just set the pace and the resting heartbeat for our teams. And again, this is important anywhere, but it's especially important when the only way to find out what people like and what's valuable is to bring it into the external world. So, for that reason, I think it's become a superpower of OpenAI, and I'm glad that Joanne thinks that I had some part in that, but it really has taken a village.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
I love this phrase, "the resting heart rate of your team". That's such a perfect metaphor of just the pace of being equivalent to your resting heart rate.

Nick Turley (00:22:46):
I actually learned that at Instacart, when I showed up there, because we were in the pandemic and it was all hands on deck. For a while, there was this... I think there was a company-wide stand-up because we disbanded all teams. We were just trying to keep the site up. And for me, I had been used to taking my sweet time and just thinking really hard about things, and that's important, but I really learned to hustle over there, and I think that's come in handy at OpenAI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:12):
Okay. So, along these same lines, I asked Kevin Weil, your CPO, what to ask you, and he said to ask you about this principle of, "Is it maximally accelerated?" Talk about that.

Nick Turley (00:23:22):
That's funny, we have a Slack emoji, apparently, for this now because I used to say that. Now, I try to paraphrase. Sometimes, I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, "Okay, why can't we do this now?" or, "Why can't we do it tomorrow?" And I think that it's a good way to cut through a huge number of blockers with the team and just instill... especially if you come from a larger company. At some point, we started hiring people from larger tech companies. I think they're used to, "Let's check in on this in a week," or, "Let's circle back next quarter to see if we can go on the plan." And I just, as a-

Nick Turley (00:24:00):
... on the plan and I just kind of as a thought exercise, always like people asking, "Okay, if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do?" That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good forcing function for understanding what's critical path versus what can happen later. And I've just always felt like execution is incredibly important. These ideas, they're everywhere. Everyone's talking about a personal AI, you might've seen news on that and I really think that execution is one of the most important things in the space and this is a tool. So, it's funny that that became a meme. It's like a little pink Slack emoji that people just put on whatever they're trying to force the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):
I was going to ask, what theme [inaudible 00:24:47]. So, it's a little pink, is there something in there like-

Nick Turley (00:24:48):
It's a Comic Sans emoji that says, is this maximally accelerated?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:53):
Okay. And so, the kind of the culture there is when someone is working on something, the push is, is this maximally accelerated? Is there a way we can do this faster? Is there anything we can unblock?

Nick Turley (00:25:02):
Yeah. And we use that sparingly, right? Because it needs to be appropriate to the context. There's some things where you don't want to accelerate as quickly as possible because you kind of want process. And we're very, very deliberate on that where your process is a tool. And one of the areas where we have an immense amount of process is safety. Because A, the stakes are already really high, especially with these models, GPT-5 which is a frontier in so many different ways. But B, if you believe in the exponential, which I do and most people who work on this stuff do, you have to play practice for a time where you really, really need the process for sure, sure, sure. And that's why I think it's been really important to separate out the product development velocity, which has to be super high from, for things like frontier models, there actually needs to be a rigorous process where you red team, you work on the system card, you get external input, and then you put things out with confidence that it's gone through the right safeguards.

(00:26:02):
So, again, it's a nuanced concept, but I found it very, very useful when we needed and for everything product development, you're a dead on arrival, so it's important to get stuff out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
We got to open source those memes so that other teams can build on this approach.

Nick Turley (00:26:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
So, interestingly with ChatGPT, and it's not a surprise, but not only is it the fastest-growing, most successful consumer product ever, retention is also incredibly high. People have shared these stats that one month retention is something like 90%, six month retention is something like 80%. First of all, are these numbers accurate? What can you share there?

Nick Turley (00:26:39):
I'm obviously limited on what exactly I can share, but it is true that our retention numbers are really exciting and that is actually the thing we look at. We don't care at all how much time you spend in the product. In fact, our incentive is just to solve your problem and if you really like the product, you'll subscribe, but there's no incentive to keep you in the product for long. But we are obviously really, really happy if over the long run, three month period, et cetera, you're still using this thing. And for me, this was always the elephant in the room early on. It's like, "Hey, this may be a really cool product, but is this really the type of thing that you come back to?" And it's been incredible to not just see strong retention numbers, but just see an improvement in retention over time even as our cohorts become less of an early adopter and more the average person, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:29):
Yeah. So, that note is something that I don't think people truly understand how rare this is when a product... The cohort of users comes, tries it out and then retention over time goes down and then it comes back up, people come back to it a few months later and use it more. It's called a smiling curve, a smile curve, and that's extremely rare.

Nick Turley (00:27:48):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's some smiling going on that's just on the team and I feel like have technology, some of it is not the product. I think people are actually just getting used to this technology in a really interesting way, where I find, and this is why the product needs to evolve too, that this idea of delegating to an AI, it's not natural to most people. It's not like you're going through life and figuring out what can I delegate? Certain sphere of Silicon Valley does that because they're in a self-optimization mode and they're trying to delegate everything they can. But I think for most people in the world it's actually quite unnatural. And you really have to learn, "Okay, what are my goals actually and what could another intelligence help me with?"

(00:28:26):
And I think that just takes time and people do figure it out once they've had enough time with the product. But then of course there's been tons of things that we've done in the product too, whether or not it's making the core models better, whether or not it's new capabilities like search and personalization and all that kind of stuff, or just standard growth work too, which we're starting to do. That stuff matters too, of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
So, you might be answering this question already, but let me just ask it directly. People may look at this and be like, "Okay, they're building this kind of layer on top of this God-like intelligence. Of course it will grow incredibly fast and retention will be incredible. What do you guys actually doing that sits on top of the model that makes it grow so fast and retain so much?" Is there something that has worked incredibly well that has moved metrics significantly that you can share?

Nick Turley (00:29:18):
One thing we've learned, I'll answer that question in a minute, but one thing we've learned with ChatGPT is that there really is no distinction between the model and the product. The model is the product and therefore you need to iterate on it like a product. And by that I mean obviously you typically start by shipping something very open-ended, at least if you're OpenAI [inaudible 00:29:38] that's kind of a playbook. But then you really have to look at what are people trying to do? Okay, they're trying to write, they're trying to code, they're trying to get advice, they're trying to get recommendations and you need to systematically improve on those use cases. And that is pretty similar to product development work. Obviously the methodology is a bit different, but discovery is the same. You got to talk to people, you got to do data science and you got to try stuff and get feedback.

(00:30:04):
So, that's one chunk of work that we've been very consciously doing is improving the model on the use cases people care about. And there's also such thing as vibes because I'm sure you know and that's one of the things that I'm excited about in GPT-5 is that the vibes are really good. So, that too is, we have a model behavior team and they really focus on what is the personality of this model and how does it speak and talk. So, there's that kind of work. I would say that's maybe a third of the retention improvements that we see or so just roughly. And then I think another third is what I would call product research capabilities. They're research driven for sure. They have a research component, but they're really new product features or capabilities. And search is one example of that where if you remember in the olden days, maybe 20 months ago or something, you would talk to ChatGPT and it'd be like, "As of my knowledge cut off..." Or, "I can't answer that because that happened to recently," or something like that.

(00:31:00):
And that is the type of capability that has been incredibly retentive and for good reason. It just allows you to do more with the product personalization, like this idea of advanced memory where it can really get to know you over time is another example of a capability like that. I think that's another good chunk. And then the third stuff is the stuff you would do in any product and those things exist too. Not having to log in was a huge hit because it removed a ton of the friction. I think we had this intuition from the beginning, but we never got to it because we didn't have enough GPU or other constraint to really go do that. So, there's the traditional product work too. So, I often think about it as roughly a third, a third, a third, but really we're still learning and we're planning to evolve the product a ton, which is why I'm sure there's going to be new levers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:52):
You mentioned something that I want to come back to real quick. You said that it was something like 10 days from Hackathon to Sam tweeting about ChatGPT being live?

Nick Turley (00:32:01):
The Hackathon happened much earlier and we were prototyping for a long time, but at some point we basically ran out of patience on trying to build something more bespoke. And again, that was mostly because people always wanted to do all this other stuff whenever we tested it. So, it was 10 days from when we decided we were going to ship to when we shipped. And the research we'd been testing for a long time, it was kind of an evolution of what we'd called instruction following, which was the idea that instead of just completing the sentence, these models could actually follow you instructions. So, if you said summarize this, it would actually do so. And the research had evolved from that into a chat format where we could do it multi-turn. So, that research took way longer than 10 days and that kind of baking in the background, but the productization of this thing was very, very fast and lots of things didn't make it in.

(00:32:50):
I remember we didn't have history, which of course was the first user feedback we got. The model had a bunch of shortcomings and it was so cool to be able to iterate on the model. The thing I just talked about, treating the model as a product was not a thing before ChatGPT because we would ship in more hardware where there'd be a release GPT-3 and then we would start working on GPT-4 and these weird giant big spend R&D projects that would take a really long time and the spec was whatever the spec was and then you'd have to wait another year. And ChatGPT really broke that down because we were able to make iterative improvements to it just like software. And really, my dream is that it would be amazing if we could just ship daily or even hourly like in software land because you could just fix stuff, et cetera. But there's of course all kinds of challenges in how you do that while keeping the personality intact while not regressing other capabilities. So, it's an open field to get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):
That's such a good example of is it maximally accelerated? Okay, we're going to ship ChatGPT 10 days.

Nick Turley (00:33:48):
[inaudible 00:33:48]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):
Holy moly. We've been talking about ChatGPT. Clearly it's kind of a chat interface. Everyone's always wondering is chat the future of all of this stuff? Interestingly, Kevin Weil made this really profound point that has always stuck with me when he was on the podcast that chat is actually a genius interface for building on a super intelligence because it's how we interact with humans of all variety of intelligence. It scales from someone at the lower end to a super smart person. And so, it's really valuable as a way to scale this spectrum. Maybe just talk about that and is chat the long-term interface for ChatGPT, I guess it's called ChatGPT.

Nick Turley (00:34:27):
I feel like we should either drop the chat or drop the GPT at some point because it is a mouthful. We're stuck with the name, but no matter what we do, the product will evolve. I think that I agree that there's something profound about natural language. It just really is the most natural form of communicating to humans and therefore it feels important that you should be communicating with your software in natural language. I think that's different from chat though. I think chat was the simplest way to ship at the time. I'm baffled by how much it took off as a concept. Even more baffled by how many people have copied the paradigm rather than trying out a different way of interacting with AI. I'm still hoping that will happen. So, I think natural language is here to stay, but this idea that it has to be a turn-by-turn chat interaction I think is really limiting.

(00:35:24):
And this is one of the reasons I don't love the super system analogy, even though we used to always use it is because if you think that way, then you kind of feel like you're talking to a person and GPT-5 it's amazing at making great front-end applications. So, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't have AIs that can render their own UI in some way. And you obviously want to make that predictable and feel good. But it feels limiting to me to think of the end-all-be-all interface as a chatbot. It actually kind of feels dystopian almost where I don't want to use all my software through the proxy of some interface. I love being in Figma, I love being in Google Docs. Those are all great products to me and they're not chatbots.

(00:36:07):
So, yes on natural language, but no on chat is where I would describe my point of view. And I'm just hoping in general that we see more consumer innovation on how people interact with AI because there's so many possibilities and you just got to try stuff. That's why chat stuck is we just did it and people liked it. So, I'm hoping that we see more there and we'll try to do our part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:31):
So, you mentioned that you kind of got stuck with this name ChatGPT. Maybe this is part of the answer, but I'm curious just are there any accidental decisions you guys made early on that have stuck and have essentially become history changing?

Nick Turley (00:36:45):
There's so many and it is funny, because you have no time to think about them and then they end up being super consequential. The day was one, we went from chat with GPT-3.5 to ChatGPT the night before, slightly better but still really bad.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:58):
What was it called before?

Nick Turley (00:36:59):
It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5 because we really didn't think it was going to be successful product. We were trying to actually be as nerdy as we could about it because that's really what it was. It was a research demo, not a product. So, we didn't think that was bad. But I think that in the original release, making it free was a big deal. I don't think we appreciate that because the GPT-3.5 model was in our API for at least six months prior to that. I think anyone could have built something like this. It might not have been quite as good on the modeling side, but I think it would've taken off. So, making it free and putting a nice UI on it, very consequential in the way that you take for granted now. And this is why I think that A, distribution and the interface are continuously important even in 2025.

(00:37:48):
The paid business, which now it's a giant business both in the consumer space and in the enterprise space. The birth of that was just to turn away demand originally. It was not like we brainstormed, "Oh, what is the best monetization model for AI?" It was really what monetization model or what mechanism would allow us to turn away people who are less serious than the people who are really trying to use it? And subscriptions just happened to have that property and it grew into a large business. I think shipping really funky capabilities before they were polished is another thing where that feels like a tactical decision, but it became a playbook because we would learn so much. Remember when we shipped Code Interpreter, we learned so much after we shipped it. Now it's known as I think data analysis in ChatGPT or something like that just because we actually got real world use cases back that we could then optimize. So, I think there's been a lot of decisions over time that proved pretty consequential, but we made them very, very quickly as we have to, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
The $20 a month feels like an important part of this. Feels like everybody's just doing that now and-

Nick Turley (00:38:57):
On that one actually, I remember I had this kind of panic attack because we really needed to launch subscriptions because at the time we were taking the product down every time. It was, I don't know if you remember, we had this fail whale, there's a little [inaudible 00:39:09] generated poem on it. So, they were like, "We had to get this out." And I remember calling up someone I greatly respect who's incredible at pricing and I was like, "What should I do?" And we talked a bunch and I just ran out of time to incorporate most of that feedback. So, what I did do is ship a Google Form to Discord with, I think the four questions you're supposed to ask on how to price something-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:32):
[inaudible 00:39:32]?

Nick Turley (00:39:33):
Yeah, exactly. It literally had those four questions and I remember distinctly A, you [inaudible 00:39:38] a price back and that's kind of how we got to $20. But B, the next morning, there was a press article on you won't believe the four genius questions the ChatGPT team asked to price their... It was like if only you knew. So, there's something about building in this extreme public where people interpret so much more intentionality into what you're doing than might've actually existed at the time. But we got with the $20. We're debating something slightly higher at the time. I often wonder what would've happened because so many other companies ended up copying the $20 price point. So, I'm like, "Did we erase a bunch of market cap by pressing it this way?" But ultimately I don't care because the more accessible we can make this stuff, the better. And I think this is the price point that in Western countries has been reasonable to a lot of people in terms of the value that they get back.

(00:40:27):
And most importantly, we were able to push things down to the free tier semi-regularly and we always do that when we can [inaudible 00:40:35], but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):
So, the survey, just to give the official name, the Van Westendorp survey is how you guys ended up pricing ChatGPT?

Nick Turley (00:40:42):
It was the top Google result. This was before ChatGPT has real-time information. Otherwise, it could have maybe price itself, but it was Discord plus Google Form plus a blog post on that methodology that got us there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):
That is incredible. What a fun story. This is the survey that Rahul Vohra at Superhuman popularized in his first- round article-

Nick Turley (00:41:00):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Definitely don't bring me on here as a pricing expert, I think you have got better people for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:08):
Whether it was right or wrong, it is now the fastest-growing, insane revenue generating business in the world. So, I wouldn't feel too bad.

Nick Turley (00:41:16):
No, it worked out. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
It worked out. And by the way, I'm on the $200 a month tier, so there's clearly a room-

Nick Turley (00:41:22):
Thank you. Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:25):
... [inaudible 00:41:25]-

Nick Turley (00:41:25):
The story of that one is interesting too because originally the purpose of the Plus plan was to be able to ship first uptime and then be able to ship capabilities that we couldn't scale to everyone. And at some point it got so many people in the Plus tier that had just lost that property. So, the main reason we came up with the $200 tier is just we had so much incredible research that's actually really, really powerful. Like o3 Pro or tomorrow GPT-5 Pro and just having a vehicle of shipping that to people who really, really care is exciting even though it kind of violates the standard way a SaaS page should look, it's a little jarring to see the 10X jump. So, thank you for being a subscriber on that and thank you everyone else who's watching you subscribed to any tier, it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
I'm just going to throw a fishing line into this pond of are there any other stories like this? You shared this incredible story of Chat with GPT-3.5 being the original name, how you came up with pricing. Is there anything else?

Nick Turley (00:42:22):
Enterprise is interesting one too because we've seen so much incredible adoption in the Enterprise and it's sort of objectively crazy to try to take on building a developer business and a consumer business and an enterprise business and all at once. But the story there is in like month one or two, it was very clear that most of the usage was work usage, actually much more than today where you've got so many consumers on the product and it's kind of sort of transcended into pop culture. But at the time it was writing, coding, analysis, that kind of stuff. And we were pretty quickly in organically in 90% of Fortune 500 companies in a way that I had seen maybe at Dropbox back when that was my two jobs ago where we had a similar story. And since then there's been more PLG companies. But the real reason we did Enterprise, remember we were debating should we do enterprise or should we launch an iOS app because that's how small the team was.

(00:43:22):
The reason we did is we were starting to get banned in companies because they all felt rightfully or wrongfully that the privacy and deployment story, et cetera wasn't there. So, I was just like, "Man, we have to do something. We're going to miss out on a generational opportunity to build a work product." And we've literally defined AGI as outperforming most humans at economically valuable work or I'd probably [inaudible 00:43:45] that, but I think that's the way we put it. And so, I feel like we had to be present there and it was a fairly quick decision at the time, but it's grown into an immense business. We just hit 5 million business subscribers up from 3 million, I think a month or two ago. So, it is kind of the spinoff that it's taking a life of its own that I'm really, really excited about for [inaudible 00:44:11]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):
That is a lot to be handling the platform essentially the API, the consumer product, the fastest-growing, most successful product in history and also the B2B side, which is clearly a massive business. Do you have any kind of heuristics for how to make these trade-offs do all this at once and stay sane and be successful?

Nick Turley (00:44:30):
That's a good question. And first off, I don't run the developer stuff anymore. We found someone way more competent to do that and he's amazing. So, I still look after the various forms of chat, but luckily you don't have to make that trade-off OpenAI does. And I can get into that too, but it keeps me a little bit more sane. I will say that you kind of have to practice in two different ways when you're building on this AI stuff. One is sort of working backwards from the model capabilities and that is much more art than science, where I think you really need to look at what tech do we have available and what is the most awesome way to productize it? And if you applied to some sort of PM framework to that, I think you would do something horrible wrong. Because if you have tech that's, for example, GPT-5 is really, really good at front-end coding now, I think that means you've got to reprioritize it.

(00:45:27):
You got to actually bring that capability to life. Maybe that's making ChatGPT better at vibe coding and rendering applications. Maybe that's more like leveraging the taste of the model to make the UI more expressive. There's a number of things we could do, but you kind of have to replan and reprioritize and that is more important than any particular audience segmentation. It's really just looking at what is the magic thing we have and how do you make it shine. Voice is a similar thing. It wasn't like our customers need voice, they're begging for it or something like that. It was like, "Wow, we figured out a way how to make these things anything in, anything out." What is a creative awesome way to productize that and then we can see what people do. So, I think that's one chunk of it. But then the other chunk of it really is more like classic product management where you need to listen to customers and then when your customers are really different, that can be confusing because ChatGPT is a very general purpose product.

(00:46:23):
We see when you look at end users, there's actually an immense amount of overlap in terms of what they want. Primitives like projects or history search or sharing and collaboration, all those kinds of things. They are actually very, very present. Whether or not you're talking to people at work or you're talking to people at home, at school, there's slightly different mechanics sometimes, but they're largely similar investments that I think we can get a lot of mileage out of. And then there's Enterprise-specific work that we just have to do. You've got to do HIPAA, you got to do SOC 2, you've got to do all those things if you want to be a serious player. And those are just non-negotiable. So, it's complex as you correctly identified, but it's kind of the curse of working on a very open-ended and powerful technology.

(00:47:11):
One analogy that someone at OpenAI who I really respect, he's like, "We're kind of like Disney, where Disney has this one kind of creative IP, which is their content, and they have cruises and they have theme parks and they have comics and they have all these different things." And I think we have amazing models, but there's all these different ways that you can productize them and we kind of just have to maximize the impact in all these different ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:38):
As you were talking, I was thinking about how usually horizontal platforms that are just so general and can do so much take a long time to take off because people don't know what to do with them. They're not amazing at anything. And this is an amazing counter example where it took off immediately and everyone figured it out and then over time they figured it out more and more.

Nick Turley (00:47:54):
But I think the reason why is because it just went live. Talk about another consequential decision actually. We were debating waitlist, no waitlist because we-

Nick Turley (00:48:00):
Actually we were debating waitlist/no waitlist because we really knew we couldn't scale the engineering systems. And the fact that there was no waitlist, which no open AI release had worked like that before, ended up being consequential because you were able to watch what everyone else was doing live. So I think when you launch these things all at once for everyone, there really is a special moment where you can see what other people are doing and learn from that.

(00:48:25):
And a lot of that is actually out of product. There's these crazy TikTok posts that go viral and they have like 2, 000 use cases in the comments. And I go through those in detail because it's not like I knew about those use cases either. They're very, very emergent and I just go through the comments and process because there's so much to learn. And for that reason, I think we get to skip the empty box problem a little bit because so much learning is happening out of product as people are watching each other either in IRL or online.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
That is so interesting because you think about Airtable, you think about Notion, all these companies, they took years to just build and craft and think and go deep on what it could be.

Nick Turley (00:49:04):
It's like they compare Airtable, which they had to do templates, they had to do all these kind of things of taking the horizontal product and making it use case driven. They compare it to the Instant Pot, which there's recipes being shared everywhere online. There's this whole ecosystem around it. I think we were really lucky with ChatGPT that that happened where there's just users sharing use cases with other users everywhere. And therefore I think we got very lucky by jumping ahead on that journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:40):
And it feels like a quarter there is Sam had big following and everyone would pay attention to something you launch. So that's a really interesting new strategy for launching horizontal product. With a huge distribution channel, just launch it and see what comes up.

Nick Turley (00:49:51):
Yeah. And of course I'm actually really excited to take some of that into the product. I think we shouldn't rest on the fact that there's so much out product discovery happening. I actually think for the average consumer, it would be amazing if the product did a little bit more work on really exposing to you what is possible.

(00:50:07):
I still feel like ChatGPT feels a little bit like MS-DOS, like we haven't built Windows yet. And it'll be obvious once we do, but there's something that feels a little bit like... Imagine MS-DOS had gone viral and you were just trying to hack little conversation starters onto it. That might've missed sort of the big picture in terms of how to really communicate affordances and value to people. And so I think there's actually a ton more product work to do in addition to just seeing use cases spread.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:33):
Are you able to share just what you think that might look like? This Windows version of ChatGPT?

Nick Turley (00:50:37):
I'll let you know when we figure it out. We're hiring. I think there's so many interesting product problems here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):
Okay, got it. By the way, I also love that TikTok was like your feedback channel.

Nick Turley (00:50:49):
Those common threads, they're just so wild. And also the love that people have for it, the excitement with which you're sharing their product, I feel like it's special that people are so excited to share what they're doing with your product. And I don't take that for granted either.

(00:52:13):
How do you find emerging use cases these days? I imagine the volume is very high. Do you have kind of a trick for figuring out, "Oh, here's a new thing we should really think about?"

Nick Turley (00:52:22):
Before I built the product team, I actually built the data science team because I was getting frustrated. I was talking to as many users as I could. And my calendar the weeks after ChatGPT, it was just 15 minute user interview the whole week through. It was usually I stopped doing interviews when I can predict what the next person's going to say. That's how I know I've talked to enough users, but it just wasn't happening. I just kept getting new stuff.

(00:52:46):
So data is one way out where I think we have conversation classifiers that without us having to look at the conversations, allow us to figure out what are people talking about, what use cases are taking off, et cetera. And I think that's very, very helpful. The quality of the stuff is important for empathy. Even though you're never going to get a rap on all the use cases people have, I still spend a huge amount of my time doing that. And then yeah, things like those TikToks, collections of threads, I think they're really, really useful. It's just fun to watch people talk to each other about the various use cases that they have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:22):
Is there kind of a new margin use case that you're excited about or is there a really unusual use of ChatGPT that you think about that'd be fun to share?

Nick Turley (00:53:30):
I mentioned this earlier, but I had always conceptualized ChatGPT as a worky product, whether or not you're at home or you at work. I feel like getting help with your taxes is very similar to the types of things you do at work where planning a trip is actually very similar to planning an event for work. So I always felt like, "Okay, this thing is going to kind of be a productivity tool."

(00:53:51):
And I think something has happened, I realized, a few months where that has begun to change and I really do think the fact that you have consumers turning to this thing for day-to-day advice, helping them have better relationships... People talk about how this thing saved their marriage is really exciting to me because they use it to process their own emotions, get feedback on their communication style. They just have a buddy to talk to about really difficult things. And that comes with a ton of responsibility and work that we have to do to make those things like life advice great, but it also is really, really important to me because you can't run away from those use cases. You have to run towards them and make them awesome. And that's part of what we're trying to do. So that emergent behavior is really, really cool.

(00:54:41):
And more broadly, I'm so excited about education. I'm so excited about health. I think it would really be a waste if we didn't take the opportunity of using ChatGPT to really, really help people. And I think we've just begun to scratch the surface on that. So there's many aspirational use cases that I want to make happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
Along those lines, an interesting use case I've recently had, I feel like it's going to be really helpful for couples that are disagreeing about something when they need a third opinion. I just had this recently where my wife's like, "You can't heat a whole thing that you're going to only eat part of in the microwave and then put it back in the fridge." It's like, "What's the problem? I'll heat it up, I'll put it back in the fridge." And she's like, "No, that's really dangerous." I'm like, "Let's ask ChatGPT." And that fact that she so trusts ChatGPT now and relies on it throughout the day, it's such a valuable third independent party that we can go to.

Nick Turley (00:55:35):
Yeah, yeah, totally. And a lot of those micro-interactions talk about interesting product work, right? Those are micro-interactions that are important. Did it definitively weigh in or did it help you guys think through that disagreement and solve it on your own? I think those details actually matter a lot and it's where we're spending a bunch of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:54):
Along those lines, there was this whole launch of the very sycophantic version of ChatGPT where it was just, " You are the best person in the world. Everything you tell me is amazingly correct." Are you able to tell us just what happened there?

Nick Turley (00:56:08):
Yeah, we have all kinds of collateral online because we really felt like we should over-communicate on how we discovered it, what we did about it, et cetera. So I encourage people to check that out. We have a whole retro on that model release.

(00:56:24):
But basically what happened is that we pushed out an update that made the model more likely to tell you things that sound good in the moment, "You're totally right. You should break up with your boyfriend" or something like that. That's just really dangerous. We took it more seriously than you even might expect because again, at current technology levels, you can kind of laugh about it. Maybe it's like, "Ha-ha. This thing's always complimenting me. I thought it was just me. I saw all those comments online." But it actually is really important to make sure that these models are optimized for the right things.

(00:57:01):
And we have an immense, I think, luxury to have a mission that affords us to really help people, a business model that does not incentivize maximizing engagement or time spent in the product, right? So it's really important to us that you feel like this product is helping you with your goals, whether not that's your current goals or even your long-term goals.

(00:57:25):
And oftentimes being extremely complimentary with the user isn't actually in service of that. So we instilled new measurement techniques. Whenever we put these models in contact with reality and we learn about a problem, we actually go back and make sure we have good metrics for this stuff. So we measure sick efficiency now with every release to make sure we don't regress and actually improve on that metric. GPT-5 is an improvement, which is really exciting for me, but we have more work from there.

(00:57:54):
And more broadly, it caused us to articulate our point of view. I actually spent a bunch of time on a blog post that we just published on Monday on what we're optimizing ChatGPT for. And it really is to help you thrive and achieve your goals, not to keep you in the product. And so there was a bunch of good outcomes from that incident. It's a good example of how contact for reality is not just important for the use cases, but also for learning what to avoid because you would've never discovered this issue purely in a lab unless you actually heard from physicians.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):
I am excited to read that blog post then. I was going to ask you this. Just like how you-

Nick Turley (00:58:29):
Yeah, have your feedback on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:31):
Yeah. I guess is there anything more there of just how you... Because this tension is so difficult, helping people feel supported, but not just letting them believe everything they want to believe. Is there anything more you can share there? Just trying to find that middle ground.

Nick Turley (00:58:43):
Incentives are important. There is a famous saying, "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:48):
Charlie Munger maybe?

Nick Turley (00:58:49):
Yeah, I think that's where it came from, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
Yeah.

Nick Turley (00:58:52):
Yeah, I think that's very, very important. So I would take a good look at our mission, our business model, the type of product we're trying to build. And I really think that ChatGPT is a very special product because I think in vast majority of cases, it makes you leave it feeling better or not worse and feeling like you're achieving something you're trying to do. So I think that those incentives really matter because it helps you reason about, "Okay, when there isn't behavior in the wild, that's not good. Was that a bug or was that by design? And with [inaudible 00:59:29] I can very much say that to us that's a bug.

(00:59:31):
And then on the forward-looking work, there's so many kind of challenging scenarios to get right. And you could easily run away from these use cases. Like you and your wife going to this thing for input on a relationship, a question or a dispute, you could very easily run away if you were totally risk avoidant and say, " Sorry, I can't help you with that." I think that's what most tech companies do when they hit a certain scale, they run away from these use cases. And I think it's a lost opportunity to help people.

(01:00:08):
So we want to run towards these use cases by making the model behavior really, really great. That can mean connecting you with external resources when you're struggling. That can mean not directly answering your question, but instead of giving you a helpful framework in the case of like, "Should I break up with my boyfriend?" ChatGPT should probably not answer that question for you, but it should help you think through that question in the way that a thoughtful companion would. So I think it's really important to do the work because I think the upside is immense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
That is a really profound point you're making there, that if most companies, if their users want to ask them something risky like getting medical advice or, "Should I break up with my partner?" or, "what should I do with this big problem I have?"

Nick Turley (01:00:51):
I feel like we would have immense regret if you had a model that was state-of-the-art on health bench, which is, GPT-5 is a state of the art on a bunch of these medical benchmarks, and you didn't use that to help people, you just disabled that use case because you wanted to avoid all possible downside. I think the duty is to make it awesome and to do the work, talk to experts, figure out how good it really is, where it breaks down, communicate that. And I think this technology is too important and has too much potential positive impact on people to run away from these high stakes excuses.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:27):
And fast-forward to today, it's saving lives regularly. It's probably saving relationships regularly. Such a consequential decision, which I imagine was made early on.

Nick Turley (01:01:36):
Yeah. We're just at the beginning of watching how this stuff can transform people. It's incredibly democratizing. If you compare, you roll out of this with the roll out of the personal computer, computers were so scarce when they first came out. And this stuff is ubiquitous in a way where you have access to a second opinion on medical stuff, you have access to a relationship buddy, you have access to a personal tutor on literally any topic that makes you curious. It's really, really special that we get to do that. Unique point in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):
Let me zoom out a bit and talk about OpenAI and just product in general. So you've worked at traditional, let's say traditional product companies, Dropbox, Instacart. Now you're at OpenAI. What's maybe the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned by building products from your time at OpenAI?

Nick Turley (01:02:33):
Each time I always tried to pick the maximally different job whenever I made a job change. So after Dropbox, I was craving a real world product because it was just so different than working on SaaS, et cetera. And after Instacart, I was craving on working on something that intellectually was interesting and had this kind of invoked the nerd in me. And so I've always looked for things that are really different.

(01:02:59):
And then once I showed up at these places, I tried to understand what makes that place successful, what is truly the thing that they cracked and how we can lean in that into that even more.

(01:03:11):
I think I spent a lot of time thinking about this with OpenAI, especially after ChatGPT. Before that it was kind of a moot point because we didn't really have much revenue or products or anything like that. There's a few things that come to mind that have driven many decisions. One is the empiricism. We talked about that a bit. The fact that you can only find out by shipping, which is why maximally lean into that. And that's a huge part of why we ship so much.

(01:03:46):
One of them is that amazing ideas come from anywhere. The thing about running a research lab is you really don't tell people what to research. That's not what you do. And we inherited that culture even as we become a research and product company. So just letting people do things who have amazing ideas rather than being the gatekeeper or prioritizer of everything or something like that has been proven immensely valuable to us. And that's where much of the innovation comes from, is empowered smart people on any function really. So that was a good inheritance from what I think made OpenAI successful and makes us successful.

(01:04:23):
The interdisciplinariness of really making sure that you put research and engineering and design and product together rather than treating them as silos. I think that's the thing that has made us successful and that you see come through in every product we ship. Like if we're shipping a feature and it doesn't get 2X better as the model gets 2X smarter, it's probably not a feature we should be shipping. Not always true. SOC 2 doesn't get better with [inaudible 01:04:48] models, but I think for many of the core capabilities, that's a good litmus test.

(01:04:52):
So I've always found you really have to lean into why is this place successful and then maximally accelerate that, so to speak, because it's what allows you to turn something that feels like an accident into something that is a repeatable label.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
So you talked about this kind of collaboration between researchers and product people. And you've been at the beginning of ChatGPT from day one to today, from zero to 700 million weekly active users. Not just registered users, weekly active users. How have you approached building out that team over time?

Nick Turley (01:05:24):
One of the other inheritances of being in a research lab is that you take recruiting really seriously. That's something that AI labs know every person matters. But many tech companies that go through hyper growth and they kind of lose their identity, they lose their talent bars, they just have chaos. So we've always had this tendency to run relatively lean.

(01:05:51):
So it is a small team that is running ChatGPT. I take co inspiration from WhatsApp where it was a very small team running a very global-scale product. And then more importantly, you have to treat hiring a little bit more like executive recruiting and less like just pure pipeline recruiting where you really need to understand what is the gap you're trying to fill on each team, what is the specific skill set and how do you fill it.

(01:06:17):
To give you an example, I'm a product person at heart, but sometimes a team doesn't need a product person because there's already someone doing that role. In many cases, we have a really talented engineering leader who has amazing product sense, or we have a researcher who has product ideas. And in my mind they can play that role. And maybe we have something else missing instead. Maybe we need a little bit more front-end or something like that.

(01:06:41):
In other cases, maybe what you're missing is incredible data scientists. So I really like to go through every single team and figure out what is the skill sets that that team needs and how do you put it together from principles rather than just assuming, "Hey, we're going to do a bunch of pipeline recruiting for all these different roles" and then people will find a team later. So I think that's always felt really important to me. And it's the way that you keep your team really small, yet super high throughput.

(01:07:08):
It also allows you to hire people who I think Keith Rabois calls us like barrels, I think. [inaudible 01:07:15] barrel's an ammunition where he thinks... I think this comes from him, but the idea being that sort of the throughput of your org depends on how many barrels you have, which is people who can make stuff happen. And then you can add ammunition around them, which is people helping those people. I think that's been really true for our recruiting too where we try to maximize the number of empowered people who can ship because that's how you have a small team and still get the ton done.

(01:07:43):
So there's a couple of things, and I spent a lot of time on vibes too with each team because I think one of the things that is challenging when you try to do research and product together is that the cultures are different. People have different backgrounds. And I think to make that go super well, you need to spend time team building and making sure that people have a huge amount of trust for each other's skill sets, feel like they can think across their boundaries. I really believe that product is everyone's job, for example. And for that reason, the recruiting doesn't stop when the people are on the door. It actually starts because you have to start making the teams awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):
Is there something you do with team building that would be fun to share? Just like something you do to create [inaudible 01:08:28]?

Nick Turley (01:08:28):
I just love whiteboarding with teams. I just love getting into a generative mindset. It breaks down everything. So that's the thing that I try. It's not particularly creative, but I found it to be a universal tool where the minute you can get people to stop thinking about what's my job versus the other person's job and more like we're all in a room trying to crack something together, that is incredible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
You mentioned this idea of first principles. This came up actually when I talk to a lot of people about you, is this something you're really big on. A lot of people talk about first principles, most people are like, " I don't really understand," or they think they're amazing at thinking from first principles. Is there something you can share of just what it actually looks like to think from first principles as maybe an example that comes to mind where you really went to first principles and came up with something unexpected?

Nick Turley (01:09:15):
Yeah, this is not something I'd ever say about myself. It's nice that someone else would say it, but it's a mysterious thing. Yeah, I think you just really got to get to ground truth on what you're really trying to solve. For example, as I mentioned with the recruiting thing, I'm not dogmatic that you have to have a product manager and an engineering manager and a designer or whatever. We're just trying to make an awesome team that can ship. So in that case, first principles means just really understanding what we actually need and what we're missing rather than applying a previously learned process or behavior. So I think that's a good example.

(01:09:54):
Another good example of I think being first principles in this environment is, does this feature need to be polished? We get a lot of crap for the model chooser, and I own it. I've tried to say that to everyone who will listen. For those who don't know model chooser, it's this giant drop down in the product that is literally the anti-pattern of any good product traditionally.

(01:10:16):
But if you are actually recent from scratch, is it better to wait until you got a polished product or to ship out something raw even if it makes less sense and start learning and getting into people's hands? I think a company with a lot of process or a lot of just learned behaviors will make one call, which is, we have a quality bar when we ship, and that's what we do. If your first principle is about it, I think you're like, "You know what? We should ship. It's embarrassing, but that's strictly less bad than not getting the feedback you wanted."

(01:10:51):
So I think just approaching each scenario from scratch is so important in this space because there is no analogy for what we're building. You can't copy an existing thing. There is no, "Are we an Instagram or are we a Google or a productivity tool or something like that?" I don't know. But you can learn from everywhere, but you have to do it from scratch. And I think that's why that trait tends to make someone effective at OpenAI, and it's something we test for in our interviews too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
So this theme keeps coming up, and I think it's just important to highlight something that you keep coming back to, which is this trade-off of speed and polish and how in this space, speed is more important, not just to stay ahead, but to learn what the hell people actually want to do with this thing. Is there anything more that you think people just may be missing about why they need to move so fast in the space of AI?

Nick Turley (01:11:46):
Yeah. I mean, the boring answer would be, oh, it's competitive and everyone's in AI and they're trying to compete each other. I think that's maybe true, but that's not the reason that I believe this. The reason really is that you're going to be polishing the wrong things in the space. You absolutely should polish-

Nick Turley (01:12:00):
You're going to be polishing the wrong things in this space. You absolutely should polish things like the model output, et cetera, but you won't know what to polish until after you ship. And I think that is uniquely true in an environment where the properties of your product are emergent and not knowable in advance. And I think that many people get that wrong because they think the best product people tend to be craftspeople and they have a traditional definition of craft. I also think it would be easy to use all what I just said as an excuse not to eventually build a great product. So I often tell my teams that shipping is just one point on the journey towards awesomeness, and you should pick that point intentionally where it doesn't have to be the end of your iteration at all. It can be the beginning, but you better follow through.

(01:12:50):
So we've been doing a bunch of work, especially over the last quarter of really cleaning up the UI of ChatGPT. I'm really excited to do the same for the sort of the response layouts and formats next. Simply because once you know what people are doing, there's no excuse to not polish your product. It's just really, in a world where you don't know yet, you might get very distracted.

(01:13:09):
So it's situational. Again, you kind of have to be first principles about it. But I do think using velocity, especially early on, as a tool... Actually this has been said about consumer social for example. It is not the first space where people have said, "Hey, you just got to try 10 things because you're probably going to be wrong." So I don't think this has never existed before as a dynamic either, but I do think with AI, it's important to internalize.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):
And there's also an element of the models are changing constantly and so you may not even realize what they're capable of, I imagine.

Nick Turley (01:13:38):
Totally. The models are changing and the best way to improve them, whether or not you're a lab or actually just someone who's doing context engineering or fine-tuning a model maybe, you need failure cases, real failure cases, to make these things better. The benchmarks are increasingly saturated. So really you need real-world scenarios where your product or model is not actually doing the thing it was supposed to do, and the only way you get that is by shipping, because you get back to use case distribution and you can make those things good. And therefore, it's actually the best way to then go articulate to your team, especially your ML teams, what [inaudible 01:14:17] climb on? It's like, "Oh, people are trying to do X and the model's failing in ways. Why? Now let's make those things really good."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):
This point about failure cases makes me think about something that both Kevin Weil and Mike Krieger shared, which is that evals are becoming a huge new skill that product people need to get good at because so much of product building is now writing evals. Is there something there you want to share?

Nick Turley (01:14:41):
My entire OpenAI journey has been this journey of rediscovering eternal product wisdom and principles in like slightly new contexts. So I remember I started writing evals before I knew what an eval was because I was just outlining very clearly specified ideal behavior for various use cases until someone told me, "Hey, you should make an eval." And I realized there was this entire world of research evaluation benchmarks that had nothing to do with the product that I was trying to make. And I was like, "Wow, this might be the lingua franca of how to communicate what the product should be doing to people who do AI research." And that really clicked for me.

(01:15:23):
And at the end of the day, it's not that different from the wisdom of, you ought to articulate success before you do anything else. It's just a new mechanism for doing that. But you can do it in a spreadsheet, you do it anywhere, and I really wanted to mystify it for people who hear that term. It's not some technical magic that you have to understand. It's really just about articulating success in a way that is maximally useful for training bots.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:50):
Awesome. I have a post coming out soon that gives you a very good how-to for PMs have how to write evals.

Nick Turley (01:15:56):
I would love to read it. And I hope you agree with what I just said because maybe there's [inaudible 01:16:02] to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):
Absolutely. Absolutely. And now there's all these tools that make this easier for you.

Nick Turley (01:16:04):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):
Okay, so this basically backs up this point that this is just a very important skill that product teams and builders need to get good at.

Nick Turley (01:16:12):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:13):
Okay. Just a few more questions. I know you have a lot going on today. One is that this trend of ChatGPT being a big driver of growth for traffic to sites, for products. For example, ChatGPT is now driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter, which completely shocked me. I just was looking at my stats, I'm like, "What the hell? This is not something I knew was coming." So just I guess thoughts on the future of this, how you think about just ChatGPT driving growth and traffic to products and sites?

Nick Turley (01:16:48):
I'm really excited about it because in the same way that I find it dystopian to talk to everything through a chat bot, I also find it dystopian to not have amazing new high quality content out there. And for that reason, I talked a little bit earlier about search and have that solved a really important user problem early on because you had this knowledge cutoff thing and you suddenly could talk about anything. Very obvious in retrospect. A, it wasn't just a user problem, it was an ecosystem problem where the original ChatGPT, it didn't have outlinks, it would just answer your question, it would keep you in the product. And even if you wanted to keep reading or go deeper, there was no way for us to drive traffic back to the content ecosystem. And I've been really excited about what we've been doing in search, not just because it gives people more accurate answers, but because it allows us to surface really high quality content, like this podcast, to people who want to see it.

(01:17:47):
And of course there's so many interesting questions about, well in the Google era, there was the search engine optimization and there was clearly understood mechanisms of how to show up and get more traffic. So I get a lot of questions from people, like, "What is the equivalent of that? The AI era, if I'm Lenny and I want to 10X the traffic to my podcast, what do I actually need to do?" And the truth is we don't have amazing answers there simply because the way to appeal to an AI model ideally is the same way that you would appeal to a real user, because the model's supposed to proxy the interest of the user and nothing else. At least that's how I want our product to work. And for that reason, my advice is super lame, which is make really high quality content, which is not as actionable as I think people making content would ideally like. And I think this is why we have more work to do because maybe there's a better mechanism or protocol that we could come up with.

(01:18:42):
But I'm excited this is driving meaningful traffic for you, and I hope that other people making great content start to feel this way because, again, it's a very new scenario.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:52):
There's two acronyms people have been using for this specific skill of AI driven SEO. I think one is AEO, which is answer engine optimization. The other is GEO. I forget the G one.

Nick Turley (01:19:04):
Generative... Yeah, I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):
Generative, yeah, AI optimization.

Nick Turley (01:19:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:08):
Do you have a favorite of those two? [inaudible 01:19:10]-

Nick Turley (01:19:10):
No, no. I try to shy away from these terms unless they become inevitable just because I'm not entirely sure yet if that should be a concept or not. Again, I think ideally, ChatGPT understands your goals and therefore understands what content would be interesting to you. And the content creator's job is to share enough information and metadata about that content such that the AI model can make a user-aligned decision. And therefore, I'm not sure if giving this thing a name and making a thing is what we should be doing or not. I'm very eager to learn from folks making content about what this could look like because. Again, we're still working through.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:59):
Along these lines, another question people think about is you have GPTs, which are kind of these custom GPT apps that you can build to answer very specific use cases. There's always this question of, you're going to build an app store where I can plug in my product into ChatGPT, monetize that. Is there stuff there that you could talk about that might be coming someday?

Nick Turley (01:20:19):
GPTs are cool. They're kind of ahead of their time in the sense that we built that kind of concept before you could really build very differentiated things. At least in the consumer space, your learning GPT is going to be pretty similar to what the model could already do out of the box. So it's mainly a way of articulating a use case to people, but it doesn't have enough tools yet to make something that feels like an app, so to speak.

(01:20:47):
Different in the enterprise by the way. We're seeing a ton of adoption of GPTs there because just every single company has very bespoke business processes and problems, etc. And it's a really, really useful tool there. They also have unique data that they can hook up to these things that it can retrieve over. So we've seen a lot of success there.

(01:21:05):
I think the idea is the right one, and I think we're going to figure out a good mechanism for it. Because when you have so much capability packed into AI, it feels really powerful to allow people to package that up in ways that have a clear affordance, a clear use case, and are differentiated from each other. I also would love it if you could start a business on ChatGPT. I think there really is a world where, as this thing hits a billion user scale, it can get you distribution, it can get you started on making something in the same way that people built on the internet and there was entirely new businesses to be built.

(01:21:41):
So I think we'll have more to share there in the future. GPT's was an early stab. And I'm just excited to evolve the thinking there as the models get good and our reach increases as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):
Amazing. That is really cool. I'm really excited to see what you guys do there. Okay. Completely different direction. Something that I know about you is you studied philosophy in college.

Nick Turley (01:22:02):
I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:02):
Computer science and philosophy, right? A combo.

Nick Turley (01:22:05):
Yeah. I started as a philosophy major and took one coding class because I really liked logic, and programming was most similar to that. And then I fell in love with coding and then eventually computer science, and I just kept doing more and more of it. But until then, I'd never really thought of myself as a technical person, so it was kind of a late discovery in my life that I'm very grateful for.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
What an incredible combination for someone leading this product [inaudible 01:22:30].

Nick Turley (01:22:30):
It's true. It is really coming in full circle in a way that I couldn't have predicted. The amount of questions you have to grapple with are truly super interesting. And philosophy, it's not a traditionally practical skill, but it does really teach you to think things through from scratch and to articulate a point of view, and I think that has come in handy numerous times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:51):
Is there a specific philosopher or school that has been most handy to you, or is there more just the general [inaudible 01:22:57]?

Nick Turley (01:22:56):
Oh, there's so many.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
okay.

Nick Turley (01:22:57):
I wrote my senior thesis on whether and why rational people can disagree, which also comes in handy when a lot of people with very different values have opinions on your model behavior or on how things should work. So I really like 20th century analytical philosophers. It's kind of dirty stuff, but I don't know if I have a favorite. It's too many to count. But that's the kind of stuff I like. And some of it ends up being quite analytical. You have let P be this theory of love and let Q be this other theory of love, and then you do some sort of symbolic manipulation. So it is just as much a brain thought exercise as it is... Or it's much more that than practical, but it taught me how to think in a way that continues to be pretty valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):
Incredible. What a cool combo of skills and background. Last question before we get to very exciting lightning round. So you were a product leader at Dropbox, then Instacart, now you're the PM of arguably the most consequential product in history. How did you land in this role? What was the story of joining OpenAI and taking on this work?

Nick Turley (01:24:10):
Every single career decisions I ever made, including my first one out of college, was just figuring out who are the smartest people I know that I want to hang out with and learn from, and can I work with them? And I don't know how to vet companies, I don't know how to really logically think through what space is going to take off or something like that, but I just do feel like I have a sense on people. And for Dropbox, I followed the head teaching assistant for a class that I was TA-ing. And for Instacart, I followed some of the smartest product people I knew. And for OpenAI, the person who recruited me, Joanne, I had messaged her about getting off the DALL·E waitlist and she said, "Only if you interview here." So she turned it into a reverse recruiting thing.

(01:25:02):
And initially, honestly, I didn't know what I would do here because it was a research lab and I was a product person and they said, "Don't worry, we'll figure it out." And they were sort of being cagey. And I thought they were being cagey because it's OpenAI and they can't share anything, but they were being cagey because we actually just didn't know yet at the time. So I showed up and I did everything under the sun and it definitely wasn't product. It was like, I think my first task was fix the blinds or something like that. And then I started sending out NDAs for people because they needed some operational help. And then I started asking, "Wait, why am I sending out NDAs? Oh, so we could talk to users." And I was like, "Talking to users, that sounds like the thing I know how to do." And I quickly stumbled into doing product work, and then eventually leading a bunch of product work. But it was organic by just showing up and doing what had to be done because, again, the company I joined was not a product company by any.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):
Wow. This is such a good example of, I don't know if you think of it this way, but when someone offers you a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask which seat. [inaudible 01:26:07].

Nick Turley (01:26:08):
Yeah, so I didn't know it was a rocket ship. I kind of got nerd sniped is what I would describe it as. Where as I prepared for the conversation to get off the DALL·E waitlist really, I just started reading about the space and that piqued the philosophy brain and then also actually the computer science brain. I was like, "Wait, this is cool." Then I started reading all the academic papers of that era. So it was intellectual itch and the people, but then I stayed for the product opportunity, obviously. Post ChatGPT, when that took off, realized that we'd built a rocket ship where we'd launched it while building it, maybe is the analogy. But I can't say that it felt like a hyped job or anything like that when I applied.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
So a lesson there is, as you said, follow the smartest people you know. There's also just this thread of follow things that are interesting to you. Just you playing with DALL·E led to this opportunity.

Nick Turley (01:27:10):
Yeah, yeah. And actually that's something we still test for is curiosity is an attribute that we think matters so much more than your ML knowledge. I'm not making a comment on research hiring. I think you do need some ML knowledge, I'm afraid. But for product and engineering and design people, and those kinds of functions, I actually think that if you are just curious about the stuff works, it doesn't matter at all if you've never done it before. In fact, if you were to filter for people who've done it before, you would have a very narrow filter of very lucky people rather than necessarily the best people you can get. So I think we've scaled that. Certainly what got me here, but I think it's actually, just generically, been a good predictor of success at OpenAI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:50):
Nick, I told you I had a billion... I said I had 2 billion questions to ask you. I feel like I've asked a lot. I feel like I still have a billion left. But I know, you told me right after this you, have a big GPT- 5 check-in that you got to get to. So-

Nick Turley (01:28:01):
We got to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:03):
We got to ship. Better ship now that this is recorded and we're putting this out.

Nick Turley (01:28:08):
This is true. [inaudible 01:28:08].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:09):
This is the forcing function. Okay, so before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with, think is important to share?

Nick Turley (01:28:20):
I try to share a little bit about how I made decisions because I hope to... I'm not that far out of school. I relate a lot to people who are coming in the job market, who are trying to figure out what to do with their life right now. And I feel very confident that if you surround yourself with people that give you energy and if you follow the things you're actually curious about, that you're going to be successful in this era. So my parting advice to folks really is put yourself around good people and do the things you're actually passionate about. Because in a world where this thing can answer any question, asking the right question is very, very important. And the only way to learn how to do that is to nurture your own curiosity. So it worked for me and it's the one repeatable thing that I can share. Everything else is luck.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:15):
This is counter to what a lot of people are doing right now, which is follow the money. Where can I make the most? How do I grow this thing and make $100 million? All these people that are getting these crazy offers were not planning to make a lot of money doing this.

Nick Turley (01:29:27):
It's quite interesting to see that stuff play out because I think all these people entered school for genuine reasons. They were excited about the space, they were researching it, they were pursuing knowledge, and I'm happy that that's being rewarded. And I don't know what the rewards will look like in the future, especially in a post-AGI world. But I just a feeling that if you follow that advice, you'll end up okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):
With that, Nick, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nick Turley (01:29:59):
Sure, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:00):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nick Turley (01:30:04):
In the product space, probably things like High Output Management or The Design of Everyday Things, or those kind of classic type things because I think they're extremely applicable in AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:13):
We talked about philosophy. I don't know, is there a philosophy book you're like, "Here's the one to read if you're getting into this."

Nick Turley (01:30:17):
Oh man. Anything by Rawls and Nozick. I like the political stuff. I think it's really fun. That is a type of thing I recommend. I don't think there's a practical reason to read that stuff, but I will nerd out about it with you. So at your own peril.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed? If you've had time to watch anything.

Nick Turley (01:30:36):
I think you've got to do a little bit of sci-fi to be in this space. You shouldn't copy any of it, but I think you learn from it. So regularly re-watch Her and Westworld. Severance was great. I think that's the stuff that, when I have time, I'll meddle with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):
That is awesome. I love that those are the two. Of all the sci-fi movies, those are the ones you resonate most with and find most interesting and valuable.

Nick Turley (01:31:03):
Yes, but that's probably my own limitation, so I'm sure there's more to discover.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:08):
By the way, have you read Fire Upon the Deep, that sci-fi book?

Nick Turley (01:31:08):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:13):
Okay. I don't know if you have time to read this book, but I think you would love it. It's such a good-

Nick Turley (01:31:16):
Oh, man. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):
... AI oriented sci-fi space opera sort of book.

Nick Turley (01:31:20):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:21):
Yeah.

Nick Turley (01:31:22):
I'll check it out, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:22):
Okay. Off tangent.

Nick Turley (01:31:22):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:26):
Okay. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Nick Turley (01:31:29):
I actually don't. I am at extreme capacity. It's kind of interesting. API developers ask me like, "Hey, are you going to copy all of our products?" It's like, I actually just do not have time to follow up what's going on outside of OpenAI because the pace here is so, so intense. So don't have good recs for you, I'm afraid.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:54):
That's a comforting answer, I think, to a lot of product companies. Go figure. Nick has no time to even listen to our stuff. Oh man. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using when things are tough, sharing with friends or family that other people find useful?

Nick Turley (01:32:10):
Being the average of the five people you spend the most time with is a thing that I really internalize, both in my personal life, where there's people who give me energy and who lift me up and make me a better person. My fiance is one of those people, but there's many people in my life. But then there's also just, at work, there's the equivalent. And again, that's how I've made all the career decisions. It's like who do I want to learn from? So I apply that principle constantly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:36):
Final question, everybody I talked to told me that you are a very good jazz pianist. You have won competitions. I think you were planning to do this as your main thing and then you somehow took the side quest.

Nick Turley (01:32:47):
Yeah, I chickened out that at the very last minute, but I was going to go to school for music. And that's still my, hopefully, chapter two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:55):
Wow. I love that that might still happen.

Nick Turley (01:32:58):
Might still happen. Now I'm in some for fun bands and we will kick from time to time. It's like the one thing I can do when I'm otherwise super tired and can't think anymore because it balances me out in good ways. But yeah, hopefully I'll get to do more of it in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):
Is there any analogs between music and your job? Anything that you find-

Nick Turley (01:33:20):
Yeah, actually. I feel like you could think of software development as, or being a product person, as you could be a conductor of an orchestra or you could be in a jazz band. And I think of it as a jazz band where I don't believe in the idea of everyone having this set part that they have to play and me kind of telling people when to play. I love how in jazz, or other forms of improvised music, you're kind of riffing off of each other and you listen to what one person played and then you play something back. And I think that great product development is like that, in the sense that ideas could come from anywhere. It shouldn't be a scripted process. You should be trying stuff out, having fun, having play in what you do. So I use that analogy a lot. For those who like music, it tends to resonate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:13):
Nick, I am so thankful that you made time for this. I know today is insane. Tomorrow's going to be even more insane for the entire world. They have no idea what's coming. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if you want them to find you online? Where can folks find GPT-5 potentially. And then just how can listeners be useful to you?

Nick Turley (01:34:31):
Just use the product. You don't even have to pay. Should be your default model starting tomorrow and just use it and don't think about models anymore. Unless you want to and you're a Pro user, in which case you get all the old models. So rest assured. And useful, honestly, I learned so much from people at large and ChatGPT users, et cetera, so just keep doing your thing. I am watching and learning, and I appreciate all the feedback. So I'm sure after we fix the model chooser, you guys will roast me for something else and I'll take it. So keep it coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:05):
Amazing. Nick, thank you so much for being here.

Nick Turley (01:35:08):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:09):
And good luck tomorrow.

Nick Turley (01:35:10):
Thanks.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:04):
When I asked in my newsletter Slack community who I should have on the podcast who's a bit under the radar, but amazing, Nickey Skarstad was the first name that I heard. And I was not surprised. I actually overlapped with Nickey at Airbnb, where she had a legendary reputation as a PM who everyone loved, but got shit done. Before Airbnb, Nickey worked at Etsy for over seven years where she went from being a forum moderator to director of product management. Then she went on to work at Airbnb for a couple years.

(00:00:31):
After leaving, she went on to be VP product at The Wing, and is currently a director of product management at Duolingo. In our conversation, we cover how to set vision, translate that into goals, and then how to execute on it, making your strategy actionable, and keeping your teams aligned and focused, designing your product review sessions, how to maintain product quality, and what skills have most contributed to her success in her career. I hope that you enjoy this conversation with Nickey Skarstad.

(00:01:02):

(00:02:02):
So many product managers are basically treated like project managers. They get hired thinking they'll be deep in product strategy, vision, and getting to know their customers, only to wind up organizing other people's work and refining backlogs and organizing tiny, tiny features.

I am really excited for our chat and to get to learn from you. So welcome.

Nickey Skarstad (00:03:28):
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:30):
My pleasure. Today, you are director of product at Duolingo, which is an awesome product, and something that I used to use. I'm not learning a language currently, but I know where to go if I were to. Can you just talk about how you got into product, and then a bit about just your journey from that point to where you are today?

Nickey Skarstad (00:03:48):
Yeah, so it's been a long, meandering journey, which is fun. And so I've been in technology roles now for 12 years. I've been in PM roles, actually product roles, for 10. I'm starting to be the person with experience in the room, which is really fun and kind of daunting at times. But how I got my first role in product was I was at Etsy in 2010 is when I joined. And I joined them, I'd say it was post-product market fit, but before they truly started to really grow and scale. And I actually joined them on their community team. So I worked as a forums moderator, and then as a seller education specialist. Yeah. Spent a couple years doing that. And then through that process became sort of one of the internal voices that had a really good understanding of how their customer, one of their core customers, their sellers, were actually using their product.

(00:04:38):
And the VP product at the time, his name's Mark Headland. Hey Mark, if you're listening. Was like, "Hey, Nickey, you're in all these product meetings. Have you thought about being a product manager?" And at the time I was like, "Oh God, no. Never." I was like, "No. Technology what? Engineering? I'd have to work with engineers? I know nothing about engineering." And so I was very imposter syndrome-y about it. And he gave me a little nudge, and was like, "I think you'd be really good at it."

(00:04:59):
And so I tried it. And I started as an APM. And I was at Etsy for around, I think, it was seven years total, and spent the majority of time actually in PM product roles. So I left as a director of product. And for most of my time there, I worked on the seller side. So it was all seller tooling, working with sellers to figure out how they could grow and scale their businesses. And it was an awesome, wild ride. But that was my first role in product. And then I went on after that into several other product roles as well.

Lenny (00:05:27):
Yeah, let's get into it. Where'd you go next?

Nickey Skarstad (00:05:29):
So after seven years at Etsy, I was kind of getting the itch to try something new. When I took a step back and was like, all right, what do I want to do next? I really loved the marketplace component at Etsy. And I don't know if this is just says something about my personality, or actually probably your personality too, is marketplace product is really hard, right? You have this constant balancing of both buyer and seller sides or both sides of the marketplace. And I really liked that. And it was something that I was good at.

(00:05:54):
And so I was like, all right, where else could I go that's interesting or having a moment? And I was like, Airbnb. Has to be Airbnb. I was a huge fan of their product. They were also post-product market fit. But sniffed around, ended up basically getting an opportunity to join the experiences team. And I joined that team when the product had just launched. So they had done sort of their early thinking, the existential thinking. Had a brand new product in market, and then I joined the team.

(00:06:18):
And so I was the first boots on the ground product manager, and really helped that team figure out how do we get product market fit? And then how do we start to think about how to scale it, which was, you can imagine, experiences is interesting because it is a very nuanced product in that, and this is similar to Airbnb if you work on homes as well, but part of it is building the digital experience that someone will interact with when they're booking an Airbnb experience. And the other part is actually influencing the live event experience that you will experience when you actually join an event or an experience.

(00:06:52):
And I think that layer of abstraction for me was really fascinating, and something I've learned a ton about is it's not just influencing the digital product, but it's actually the consumer experience when their boots around the ground. And that is another layer of complexity. And so that was super fun. I was there for about, I think, a little over two and a half years. Started as a PM. I think I got promoted a couple times. Left as senior product lead, I believe was my title. And forever grateful for that experience because I learned a ton about product market fit and also product quality.

Lenny (00:07:23):
Is there anything else you took away from that experience? Because I was at Airbnb at the same time. We never really got to work together. But I just heard amazing things about you on the experiences team. And experiences was a wild ride, from what I understand. Is there anything that you took away from that experience that kind of has stuck with you as a PM?

Nickey Skarstad (00:07:39):
Yeah. So part of it is more of just the way Airbnb works is something that I think I use every day in my job, which is just truly thinking about product quality and the end consumer experience. And Airbnb does not ship product if it is not good. And even if they're trying new things, they are obsessed with the end consumer experience. And I learned so much from that line of thinking because just, if it shipped, it was really high quality. All the edge cases had been thought through. And the experience I had before that was definitely we were shipping things more quickly, things weren't always perfect. And it's not to say that everything Airbnb ships is perfect, but I think that obsession with the end consumer experience really influences the quality of their product suite and is something I try to bring to my job today because no one does it better, in my personal opinion.

Lenny (00:08:28):
I'd love to unpack that a little bit. There's kind of two questions in my mind. Is there an example of that at Airbnb where it's just like, okay, here's how they keep quality so high? And then do you have any advice for just how to do that as a company?

Nickey Skarstad (00:08:40):
Yeah. So I don't think that's easy for sure. One of the things Airbnb did for experiences is we had this balancing metric, which was basically using the review rate as sort our end all, be all top line goal. So you can imagine a business like that. Obviously we needed to have revenue kind of moving through the platform, and we cared about high level bookings. But really at the end of the day in the beginning, we were obsessed with making sure every person who booked actually had a good experience when they showed up to experiences.

(00:09:08):
And so especially if you are building early product, really thinking about how can you pick some good quality metrics that might actually balance or conflate with growth metrics, and use that as sort of your north star because it really helped the whole team to understand what they were actually trying to do at the end of the day. Growth was important, sure. Obviously we needed to grow for a lot of reasons. But the most important thing was that the actual customer experience was great. And I know Airbnb does that in other places too, but that really was experience's top line goal was our review rate and quality and it trickled down for sure.

Lenny (00:09:43):
How did they operationalize that? Because it sounds great. Cool, let's make sure everything, all the reviews are five star. How do you build that into the way the team operates and tracks their success?

Nickey Skarstad (00:09:53):
Yeah. So a big part of that was actually operational, which was just making sure that hosts who weren't meeting those specific rigorous standards. There was a lot of coaching and education that was happening. Some of that was in the product and some of it wasn't. It was something that was discussed at all of the meetings that we had across everyone's teams, right? Everyone understood that it was important. And so I think that really impacted both the ops team as well as the product team who are literally building the product that would bring that to life. And I think just thinking from, especially if you're a founder and you're thinking about building your sort of early metrics, there's a lot of ways to really make sure your team really understands what that means.

(00:10:33):
Another thing we did a lot on the experiences team is we just dogfooded all the time. And so we were lucky in that it's a really fun product to dogfood. We were taking experiences all over the world all the time. But it really helped because you would know right away when you showed up to an event, if you were going to have a five star experience or if it was not going to be great. I mean that really helped us too because then we would go back to the teams and be like, "All right, we were just in San Francisco. We were on an experience last night, and it did not go well. What do we do about it?" So there's lots of ways to do it. But dogfooding is a good one.

Lenny (00:11:02):
I know Brian is infamous for texting the team anytime anything isn't working right in the product. And I know he was very intimately involved in experiences. Is that something you've learned to do just to kind of like, "Hey team, I found a big problem. Let's fix it." Or do you try to avoid that and not create that stress?

Nickey Skarstad (00:11:20):
I mean I think sometimes that can be a healthy stress if you do it in the right way. The nice thing I think is just making autonomous teams that feel like it is their goal to bring that quality experience to life can help you avoid some of that. But I do think that pushing teams to use the product so they firsthand experience when it is not great is a really good way to give teams sort of the motivation to act on fixing things like that. But I don't know that I text people, but I'm on Slack all the time. So if anything, I'm going to Slack you.

Lenny (00:11:49):
Great. Okay. Maybe one more question on this topic because it's so interesting. So on experiences you measured, I imagine, percentage of trips that were five star. Are there other quality metrics that you've used at other companies that you found helpful for keeping track of product quality and maintaining product quality?

Nickey Skarstad (00:12:03):
Yeah. So another one that we used at Etsy, which was an interesting one, is we realized that, so one of the pieces of product that I owned was the onboarding flow. So it was onboarding new sellers specifically. And you can imagine if you're owning that flow, you're just going to be like, all right, we just need a ton of sellers, and we need them to open their shops right away. So we started and we went down that path. And then we realized we actually tanked a couple of downstream metrics that we didn't really understand at first. And those metrics were basically getting sellers to a first sale. So we opened up a lot of shops, but they actually weren't successful when they were on the platform, and they weren't successful in a certain amount of time.

(00:12:37):
So we did a lot of unpacking of what happened there, why did we do that, and actually does that matter? And the end answer was, yes, it matters greatly. When Etsy sellers are opening their shop, it's really important that you get them a sale right away because it's a huge motivator, right? If you make a sale in your first day, you're like, "Oh wow. Okay, this is a thing. I could make money doing this. This is exciting. I get to ship something to my buyer." If it takes you seven days, you start to be like, "Oh no. I'm not good enough. I'm terrible at this." 10 days, into 30 days, it really impacts people.

(00:13:06):
And so we actually put more friction in the onboarding flow to help to start to solve for that. So we actually slowed you down. We made you be more thoughtful about what you were listing. And by doing that, we actually helped you get to a first sale faster. And so that was another good example of a quality metric that we used, which was, I think it was first sale in seven days. I might be wrong. But something along those lines. And it actually conflated with the high level growth metrics, but it was a huge quality predictor, and it was really important for long term seller success.

Lenny (00:13:32):
So interesting. That's such a good topic. And I feel like we could explore that for an hour, but maybe for a little bit longer. Was that metric the metric that you used to measure supply growth at that point? Or was it alongside just general growth?

Nickey Skarstad (00:13:45):
Yeah, it was alongside general growth. It wasn't our top, top OKR. But it mattered because, again, it's sort of like you think about these things a bit as a seesaw, right? We basically were balancing our growth with making sure people were successful. And the more equilibrium you had there, the better it was for their overarching marketplace. And it's similar if you think about experiences too, right? Where, all right, you could just be growing, but people are having a terrible experience. So how do you balance those two things? And if you can get those two things in balance, you're going to cruise, and you're going to be more successful longer term.

Lenny (00:14:14):
Got it. At Airbnb when I was working on supply growth, our main goal for the supply growth team was similar. And that was actually the goal we had, which is new listings that got their first booking. We only counted listings that had one booking as new supply. Everything else didn't really count. Because we knew that if it got booked at least once, at least it's got some level of quality and people want that place, and it's valuable to the marketplace. Okay. So you were at Airbnb, and where'd you go next?

Nickey Skarstad (00:14:40):
Yeah. So I went to a startup. And for lack of a better way to describe this, they were basically kind of building a marketplace as well, but it was more of a marketplace of ideas. And I hate when people say that, because I think it's cheesy, but it's true. They had physical co-working spaces, and they were trying to take some of the magic that was happening in their spaces. So people meeting each other, networking, people getting funding for their startups, et cetera. And they wanted to bring it online and they wanted to try to scale it so it wasn't constrained inside of their four walls. So I helped them basically come up with a longer term strategy, start to figure out how to unpack that, and get product market fit. And then also just build a technology team around trying to solve that.

(00:15:16):
And so that started late 2019. And then I was out for a bit, had a baby. And came back and then COVID happened. And they were a physical co-working business. That was where their majority revenue came from. And so COVID was pretty horrible for what they were trying to do. They also had some other cultural issues, and so the whole thing kind of paused/fell over. So I actually spent a year hiring a team and then had to lay them off, which was a great lesson in leadership. I'm not going to lie. I learned a lot about how to lead in that experience.

(00:15:49):
But after that, and it was COVID, I had a eight month old, and so I spent time actually just vibing with my kids, which was kind of fun. And then ended up going to Shopify after that. And so I was looking for a more bigger scaled, not startup, and was trying to find something a little bit more something where I could be longer term and was more excited about, and took a platform role at Shopify. And so that was really interesting in that I had, honestly, for the most part spent the majority of my career in super consumer facing roles. And the role that I took was more platform.

(00:16:20):
And I realized that, honestly, pretty quickly after I took the role, I was like, oh, good to know. I didn't really understand what this job was and now I know what it is, but it does not give me energy. And so I felt like I had a lot of red energy every day. And so I made a call pretty quickly to bounce, which was actually another good learning experience. I think I've gotten a lot. As I've advanced through my career, have learned a lot about what gives me Nickey Skarstad energy and have been really prioritizing that, especially in a post-COVID world.

(00:16:46):
And so left Shopify, and made my way to Duolingo. And so Duolingo has been super fun. I've been there since September of 2021. And in the process of helping them kind of think through a zero to one product challenge, something that's newer. Can't really talk about it unfortunately, but has been another sort of product market fit thinking exercise. It reminds me a little bit of some of the work that I did on experiences. And so it's been actually pretty challenging. It's super fun. So I'm also having a great time here as well.

Lenny (00:17:12):
Amazing. The companies you worked at is incredible and there's so much I want to explore there. Going back to Shopify briefly, a lot of PMs, I imagine, are trying to decide should they stay where they're at? Should they go explore other places? So you said the thing that kind of pulled you out there was just the platform role didn't feel like a fit for you. Do you have any advice for folks on just how to know if a role or a company isn't a fit for them?

Nickey Skarstad (00:17:37):
Yeah. So I think I really learned that while I was there, and also I want to make sure I actually had a great experience at Shopify and I think it is an awesome company. I would highly recommend people work there, especially if they like platform product work. One of the things I did when I was like, I don't know if I love this is I actually went through my calendar and I changed the colors of all of the meetings on my calendar to red, yellow, and green after I had the meeting. And I looked. And basically if it was yellow, I was like, okay. It was a fine meeting. My energy was baseline. If it was red, I was either bored or I was stressed, or I was not having a good time. And if it was green, it gave me energy and I felt excited and I wanted to keep working on that.

(00:18:17):
And when I looked back at the last few weeks, it was almost all red and yellow. And I was like, okay, this is really from an energy standpoint, I don't think I love this. And so I would say think about the work that you're doing and that lens. Get really good at figuring out what are the things that you love most about being a product person, and how can you optimize your next role for those things that you love?

(00:18:39):
We should talk a little bit more about this, but each company has a very different product org. And the day to day of your job as a product manager, depending on where you go in the product that you're building, is very different. And so really thinking through what that work looks like, what their process is, who your end consumer is, what will the actual work you be doing every day, what will that be? And if you can get really clear on that, and then get clear on what gives you energy and what you love, it makes it a lot easier to figure out where you should go next.

Lenny (00:19:04):
Wow. I love that tactic. I've never heard of that. Just going back to the meetings that you have in measuring, just reflecting on how much energy that meeting gave you. Great tip. Thank you for sharing that. And I'll also double down on Shopify is an amazing place to work. Just to make that clear. It's probably one of the few places I recommend PMs go try to work at.

Nickey Skarstad (00:19:23):
Yeah. I think especially if you're newer in your PM career, they just have a really great organization. And I think it's a great place to learn how to PM. Also their product, it's a huge scaled product. And so it's complicated to build in. So I think it's a great place to really understand second order systems and systems thinking. And especially if that type of work gives you energy, I would recommend that people look for jobs there. But again, get really good at what you love. And I think what I've realized longer term is I really like the zero to one early stage. How do we get product market fit? And how do we really think through the early experience? And Shopify is at a very different stage than that. They're doing that in a couple places for sure, but that's not their day to day. And so that was interesting.

Lenny (00:20:06):
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Going back to what you just touched on, the idea of product org and structure and how different companies build product, there's kind of two ways to approach this and take whichever direction you want. Which of the companies you've worked at did you enjoy most, and that's kind of stuck with you as a way you want to build product? Or just like, how would you approach building a product org in cross-functional teams versus not, and reporting lines, things like that? What do you recommend there?

Nickey Skarstad (00:20:34):
Yeah. So I feel like you're asking me to pick a favorite child, which especially as a mother, that's hard to do. But no, I don't know. I feel like I've learned things from a lot of these different places and it's hard to choose. I think some of my early work at Etsy was very formative, and it was where I learned how to be a product manager. And so I feel very proud of that. I also think Etsy was out there building in public. I'm literally doing air quotes right now. I know you can't see me.

Lenny (00:20:57):
I can see them.

Nickey Skarstad (00:20:58):
But they were doing that because they had such a passionate, involved, engaged early community that they could not just ship things and have them land well if they did not involve their community early. So they were doing prototyping, beta testing, and basically getting people to try things and give feedback on things. I honestly, I think before a lot of people were, and that was something at the time that was really interesting and has really stayed with me, it's how to work with community and how to build community around the product that you're building.

(00:21:25):
Because at the end of the day, especially when it's early days, it really helps scale, get people to evangelize what you're building, help teach other people how to use it, things like that. And so I learned how to do that at Etsy. And I think that was super formative. And then also just Airbnb, what we talked about before, and just deeply baking in product quality and the end consumer experience into everything that you're building is also something I literally apply every day. So if I had to choose, it would be those two places, but I plan on continuing to learn.

Lenny (00:21:54):
Interesting. Both very community driven businesses.

Nickey Skarstad (00:21:57):
True.

Lenny (00:21:58):
And then in terms of how they structured their org, is there anything there about just here's what I've learned works best for how to build product teams, structure product teams, that stuck with you?

Nickey Skarstad (00:22:07):
Yeah. So I think there's kind of two overarching popular organizational modes for product org specifically. There's either the functional organization where everyone in the product team will report up through either a VP product, or a chief product officer, or something along those lines. And I think that actually really works in certain circumstances and is great. And typically how that works is you'll have your product partners, your trifecta, if you will, you have your design partner and your engineering partner, they will typically also report up into functional leadership. I think in bigger organizations that really works well, especially when you have orgs that need a lot of development in the function. So you'll have a lot of either APMs or product managers who are newer in their career and need a lot of support in development. And I think those functional ways of building makes sense. When I was at Etsy, that was the way that the reporting structure was and it made a lot of sense.

(00:23:00):
And then on the flip side, actually, when I was at Airbnb, because experiences was this new pretty nascent business opportunity, it had a GM structure. And so basically the whole product org that worked on experiences laddered up into a business leader and that business leader managed all of the functions. So they were the manager of the operations team, the marketing folks, product, and whatever. And I actually think that really worked for team like experiences at a company like Airbnb because what it did is it gave the leader of that business a ton of autonomy to really figure out what does this business need to be successful? And they didn't have to rely on, I guess they did in some ways, but not 100% rely on the larger company's resources to get the work that they needed done.

(00:23:44):
And I actually think that had they launched experiences inside of the Etsy style of organizational structure, it never would've succeeded because it had such a unique business need, and it needed its own process and ways of building product, et cetera. And because they sort of, hate to say wall it off, because it wasn't fully walled off, but because they gave it its own space and its own structure, it allowed it to succeed because they were able to fund it in the right way, give it the resources that it needed, et cetera.

(00:24:14):
So I've seen those two types of models work. And I think if I was a founder and I was building my initial product org, how I would think about it was basically what are we trying to build? What is the product? And then what type of process do we need to put in place for us to figure out how do we build it? And then what type of people do we need? And then really taking a step back to really figure out, all right, organizationally, how do we shape this so we can make sure that those people have autonomy and they have what they need to just be able to cruise? So I honestly don't think there's a right way. I know that's a non-answer. I think it really depends on what you're trying to build and the stage at which you're at.

Lenny (00:24:48):
Is there a default approach you'd suggest, just like most often you should go to the GM model, or most often you should just go with this cross-functional team?

Nickey Skarstad (00:24:58):
Yeah. I mean, I think especially if your business is new, going functional makes sense because you don't necessarily have a lot of organizational complexity. Airbnb at the time we were there, Lenny, was a huge company, right? It had tons of different teams that were trying to tackle many different problems. So that GM model made a lot of sense because it again was able to take a specific business opportunity, give it the resources that it need, and give it space to run. When your company's smaller stage, I think that matters less. Typically, especially if you're working on solving similar problems as an organization, functional makes a ton of sense. Because then you're also thinking more holistically about, all right, how do we build the right product development process across different functions to make sure that we are, to use a bad metaphor, it's like the symphony metaphor. You have all these different instruments that need to figure out how do we play together at the right times? And I think that functional way of working actually allows you to do that really well.

Lenny (00:25:52):
This episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify, and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList's head of product, "Banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack." Embedding banking into your product, not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain and monetize your customers.

(00:26:21):
Unit is the market leader in banking as a service, combining multiple bank partners with a developer friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks. Unit is trusted by leading brands, such as AngelList, ID, Invoice2go, and Roofstock. To hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.

(00:26:54):
Something I learned at Airbnb and from many other companies at this point is there's never going to be the one right way to structure, and companies bounce back and forth between them. Like Airbnb, for example, has moved from GM model to functional reporting lines back to GM. And so things change and you try some, see how it goes, adjust, optimize for the biggest opportunity. And then you'll probably change it six months later.

(00:27:18):
I asked a few people that know you and that worked with you questions that they think I should ask you. And one of the questions that came up most often is around how you set vision, translate that into goals, and then execute on those goals. And I know that's something a lot of PMs want to get better at and something that a lot of PMs aren't great at. And so can you just share any thoughts, advice, stories around that and how you do that well?

Nickey Skarstad (00:27:43):
Yeah. Well one, I want to know who you talked to. That's terrifying. Hopefully they said good things. You don't have to out them.

Lenny (00:27:49):
Unnamed sources. Unnamed sources.

Nickey Skarstad (00:27:51):
Yes. Well I'm glad to hear that because that actually is some of the work that I honestly love the most. And when I look at my calendar, those are moments where I am green energy. And so I have some first principles that I like to apply when I'm thinking about setting high level vision and strategy. And the first is make sure that you pull in your people and your team. I've seen a lot of director level people through my career who will try to work on strategy in a vacuum alone. They'll write a document and they'll be like, "Okay, team. Here's what we're doing. Here's our strategy." And it never goes well. And it doesn't go well. It might be the right strategy, but because you did not bring people along on that journey to come up with it, they did not feel like they had a hand in crafting it themselves. They are often not bought in, and getting people to buy in when they haven't been involved is very challenging and time consuming. We don't got time, right?

(00:28:40):
And so I think that's my first principle is just bring along the team. And I think there are ways to do that where you're not voting on strategy. You should not be voting. I think good product work is often not democratic, right? You need a clear leader who understands a lot of the signals and understands the larger competitive marketplace that can make decisions. And I think, especially when you're thinking about strategy, it's great to get input, but ultimately at the end of the day, you should have one person who is responsible for it.

(00:29:06):
And the other thing is a lot of times people don't really talk to leadership or the larger business leaders to get organizational context that helps them come up with the right strategy. They'll sort of build something in a vacuum, and then they'll come up with it and they'll get a ton of feedback from people across the org that were like, "Oh, this conflates with our strategy. We're doing this, and it's very similar." Or, "Our structural platform actually does not have the capability for us to do that thing." Whatever. And so just make sure that you're talking to people. And also all the way up to the CEO, and making sure the founder and the CEO is very bought in because ultimately, at the end of the day, they're choosing to resource what you're working on and are going to help you meet what you need. So those are some of the foundations for good vision and strategy work.

(00:29:51):
And then kind of zooming down into the weeds, I really like the vision mission strategy pyramid. I think might be a little tired. I like to think it's wired. But yeah. So if you just think about a pyramid shape, at the top is vision. Below it is mission and strategy, and then objectives. And this is a very simple framework. You honestly just Google vision mission strategy objectives, and you'll see it in Google image results. And all it is really is thinking about hitting those specific notes and thinking about them top down. So where do you need to go long term? What is the long term vision of what you're trying to do? In 10 years, if you could zoom up and look at what an ideal path for you would be, what is that? Write it down.

(00:30:32):
And then you start, as you go down the pyramid, you get clearer and basically you bring things down to your moment in time more clearly. So if you're thinking about your mission, all right, it's another level of abstraction of how do we make our vision come to life. And then you get into strategy. All right, how do we actually pick apart what we think is going to need to happen for us to actually be able to execute on that vision? And then your objectives can be OKRs, or whatever sort of goal setting model that you use to really one level get clear on, all right, in the next three to six months, what are the actual notes that we need to hit to be able to sing that beautiful symphony, is a terrible metaphor. And now I'm open to say it. But whatever.

Lenny (00:30:32):
I get it. I get it.

Nickey Skarstad (00:31:15):
Dang it. Love a bad metaphor.

Lenny (00:31:16):
That's evocative. While we're on that topic, actually just to interrupt briefly, how are you very practically doing this for say vision and mission? Are you starting a Google doc and writing it out, are you using Miro or FigJam, or something like that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:31:30):
Yeah, so I think visioning exercise is a great moment to pull in your larger team. Because I'm remote now, I would use Miro or FigJam. Duolingo, we use FigJam typically because we are super embedded in Figma. In the past I've used MURAL. I actually personally like MURAL's whiteboarding product better. So I would open that up and I would walk through a number of things with the team and do a brainstorm literally. All right. Where do you all see us going in 10 years? What do we think what is the larger competitive landscape going to do in the next 10 years that could need to influence the work that we're doing? What are their ideas, and get everyone thinking.

(00:32:05):
Good brainstorm are often cross-functional. So go outside of your own team. Can you pull in somebody from marketing? Can somebody from the larger policy team sit in? How do you make it really cross-functional and really zoom up and give everyone the space and the freedom to think existential and to frame it that way,?we are going to be thinking in a five to 10 year timeline. Do not worry about what's happening today. And honestly, if you do that right, those are super fun exercises.

Lenny (00:32:30):
And you're doing this remotely, I imagine.

Nickey Skarstad (00:32:32):
Yep.

Lenny (00:32:33):
And so do you just kind of schedule a meeting, kick it off, point everyone to this Miro doc, for example, with a bunch of prompts and sticky notes and things like that? How do you actually practically do that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:32:44):
So I would pre-fill out the Miro beforehand. So figure out what are the things you want to discuss with your team, create them as headers in the Miro document. So when everyone lands in there, you have a very clear here's what we're talking about today. You can put that into the agenda on your calendar invite. I've actually been to some really good strategic brainstorms that will attach some kind of competitive thinking landscape in advance. So people could have a little bit of a pre-read.

(00:33:06):
And then when you get into the actual session, you already have the time allotments scheduled and thought through. And both Miro and FigJam have really awesome timer, and it'll play music while everyone is working. It's pretty cute. FigJam's sounds are really well done. Whoever their sound architect is, bravo. And it'll ding after, give them 10 minutes and it'll give you a nice chime, and then you can review them together and you can go through each touchpoint that you want to talk about.

(00:33:33):
After it's done, I like to do some synthesis together in the meeting. So basically grab ideas that are similar, bucket things into concepts that are alike. And then I will take it later and spend more time thinking about it. I think a lot of people think you have to actually come away with a vision together in a meeting that's very clear, and you don't. You can just come up with ideas, take a stab at drafting it, and get some more feedback before it's final.

Lenny (00:33:56):
One last question on this thread, which also could be an entire hour of discussion, are there any examples of prompts or things you ideated that you could share? I know you can't talk about what you're doing at Duolingo, but just to make it a little more concrete for people, what are some examples of things that you brainstormed?

Nickey Skarstad (00:34:11):
Yeah. I mean, so to take it back to experiences, because we've talked about that a lot, so people have some baseline context. Some of the early experiences visioning was really interesting because it was all about what type of experience can we create. And really thinking through when you've traveled in the past, what has brought you joy? Or what were the moments in your travel journey that have been really interesting, provocative, basically you remember the most, and why? And thinking through some of those things as a group. And those are good group exercises, because you're like, wow, I got to know a lot about Lenny by that crazy travel experience that he had. And so really kind of thinking through about how you craft really meaningful prompts that, again, connect to your strategy. So how does that ladder up into strategy? Obviously thinking through the experience that you're creating is going to help you come up with the right vision and fill out your pyramid in the right way, right?

Lenny (00:34:57):
Okay. So we went on kind of on a tangent around brainstorming. Did you want to share more around just going from vision to goals to execution?

Nickey Skarstad (00:35:04):
Yeah. So I think just generally, as you walk down that strategy pyramid, really getting down into the OKRs. And I think it's important because sometimes strategy is too abstract and too high level. And it's hard for people to take the step on how do I walk up that pyramid? And that to me is where having good strategy and having good OKRs help your team do that. And so good OKRs to me are just clear articulations of your strategy, whatever it is that are important to you, and it boils it down into the next three months, here's what we're working on. And I think that is just really good for teams because, again, if you're always in the clouds, it starts to get hard to really bring things down to the feature level of we're going to create a Jira ticket for this specific thing that we need to build. It needs to connect up to a strategy and back down.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Got it. Where do you put, say, these OKRs? Do you just brainstorm, come up with vision and rough strategy, that translates into goals? Where do you do this? And then also just how long do you usually spend on this overall process?

Nickey Skarstad (00:36:06):
Yeah. So the way that we do it at Duolingo now is we work on quarterly OKRs. And so that process will kick off usually the third month in the quarter. Really thinking through, all right, how are we trending on our OKRs this quarter? Did we commit to the right number of things? How are we doing? And then it is going, all right, so what do we need to do next quarter? And ideally, again, that's going to plug into a longer term plan. Otherwise it feels a little messy, and it feels not grounded in a long term plan or strategy in any way, shape, or form.

(00:36:36):
And then, so what we'll do is spend a few weeks as a team coming up with, all right, what could the next quarter look like? What is going to add the most impact and help us execute on that long term strategy? And then how do we make sure that we're setting the right objectives and KRs below them? And then usually there's some sort of leadership review. I actually forget, Lenny, how did goal setting go at Airbnb? I honestly don't remember. It sounds terrible, but it was a while ago. I can't even remember if Airbnb used OKRs.

Lenny (00:37:03):
There was a long period where OKRs were a very big deal. Our head of product was really gungho on OKRs. And I think for a couple years, we were very strict OKR culture. And then it kind of evolved into just rough-

Nickey Skarstad (00:37:15):
Goals.

Lenny (00:37:16):
... interpretation of OKRs. Yeah, goals and strategy and mission and vision. And so it's kind of this morphed version at this point, as far as I know.

Nickey Skarstad (00:37:23):
Gotcha. Yeah. And I will say OKR frameworks might not be the best for every single team, but having some sort of goal framework that is shared across functions is useful no matter the size or the scale of your business. I think a lot of times people get hung up and they want to nitpick OKRs specifically. And I think some of those criticisms are very fair. But you should have some sort of framework that's shared from a process standpoint across your team that everyone can use and work on together. Because again, it takes your strategy and it brings it down into the now. So you can act on, in the next three months, you can bring something to life, and you're very clear on what that looks like.

Lenny (00:37:57):
I'm going to pull out a thread of something you mentioned earlier of how to finally make decisions. And how in your experience the PM kind of is often sort of a final decision maker. I'd love to hear any advice you have of how to set that up on a team where it's either clear the PMs have a little bit more say and/or just bring people along to a final conclusion. Is there any advice on tips and tactics used to help with that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:38:22):
Yeah. So I actually just read this really great book that is slightly tangential, but I thought it really applied to this type of basically getting people to align on decisions. It's by Chris Voss. He is this famous FBI negotiator. I think it's called Split the Difference: Negotiating As if Your Life Depends on It. Don't quote me on that.

Lenny (00:38:38):
I think it's Never Split the Difference, right? And then I think he's also got a masterclass which I've watched, which is really good.

Nickey Skarstad (00:38:43):
I actually haven't watched the masterclass yet, but it's on my list after reading the book. And a lot of it, I think, especially because he's an FBI person, I thought it was going to be very much, "You're going to do this." And it's all basically his whole approach is empathy, and it's repeating things back to you, making people feel heard, making sure that you're hearing why they maybe don't like your strategy, or why they think that's a bad OKR. And I think if you can spend some time just listening to your team and really understanding why is this not resonating, you can help guide people on the right path. Or you realize you're wrong. Good PMs are humble people, right? You're not always right. Not always going to be right. So how do you know when you're right and wrong is another good podcast that you should do with somebody else cause I'm probably not very at it. Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:43):
Good tip. I really like that.

Nickey Skarstad (00:39:28):
Yeah. But I think that helps. And the other thing is I love the concept of one way versus two way door decision making, right? If your team is making a really critical long-term decision that's going to be limiting to a lot of the future things that you could want or need to do, that is a one way door decision. And you should spend time really thinking about discussing it, getting feedback and buy-in from your larger community, from your leadership team, et cetera. If it is a two-way door decision, it's not going to make a huge impact, you can change it later if you need to, let your team cruise on those things. Because it gives people autonomy. It helps you move fast. And then it just makes sure that when it does come down to decisions that are harder to change longer term, then those are the moments you should spend time and really think about and discuss and debate, et cetera.

Lenny (00:40:09):
Do you have any examples or stories that come to mind of those sorts of decisions that you kind of help people just go for it, even though I may not necessarily agree?

Nickey Skarstad (00:40:17):
Let's see. Yeah. So one big one that we made at Airbnb that was pretty formative in early days was we came up with basically an articulation of what we thought a good experience was, and the standards that an experience needed to meet for it to be considered a good experience for us. And that was a many month long term project. And it was so important because we ended up building the product around it, building our policies around it, building how we educated our hosts around it. We had one moment in time to figure it out and get it right until it scaled everywhere. And so that was a true one way door decision where it was really hard to change later because we literally needed it to be relatively final.

(00:40:53):
On Etsy, there was some big decisions that were made at certain points in time around what can be sold in the marketplace, and how to think through what constitutes something that is hand made. Those were one way door decisions, right? It's really hard to change that later because it's going to influence all of the listings that you have in your ecosystem. And so I think really thinking through those types of things are important and really setting teams up to be able to pause and spend some time to get it right because it will influence the end product in a very real way.

Lenny (00:41:23):
How do you know if it's a one way or a two way door decision? Do you find that it's generally pretty obvious when you're making the decision, or is it sometimes like, oh shit, we should have thought about that more?

Nickey Skarstad (00:41:34):
Yeah. I would say I think I'm good at this 80% of the time these days, just because I've seen it done wrong in a lot of ways. But I think it's a muscle that you build honestly, and you get better over time about thinking about second order thinking. And so it's starting to understand, all right, if I make this decision today, it's going to impact this next level of decisions and the next level after that. And that will cascade through our larger system.

(00:41:56):
A great book to read if you are a product person is Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows. It's just about really thinking through how systems work, and then you can start to extrapolate what is the second order effect of the system. And if you think about that through your own ecosystem, it starts to help you understand, all right, this is a linchpin in our larger ecosystem that we got to be really careful about if we're going to touch it or change it longer term. But I do think some of that it's muscle, you build it over time. You make a couple of mistakes sometimes, and then you have to realize the true consequences of those mistakes and you don't make it again.

Lenny (00:42:29):
Can we talk a bit more about the second order decision framework? I know you have a awesome newsletter post about this, and it was something I wanted to chat about. Is this a framework that PMs can use to make better decisions? And I guess how could they do that? And then maybe just describe a little bit more about just this concept of second order decisions, because it sounds really important.

Nickey Skarstad (00:42:50):
Yeah. Basically what second order thinking is is you being able to think beyond the decisions that you're making today. The decisions you make today will affect tomorrow's decisions and your ability to build on your decisions that you made today. And this feels very existential and meta, but why it's important is that, especially when you're building product, is there's a cost associated with your time of everything you build. Especially when you're building marketplaces or anything with UGC content. When you make a change today, and it impacts every single user in your ecosystem that then is going to act on that change, it's really hard to make those changes later.

(00:43:23):
Let's talk about Airbnb home listing as an example. Really thinking through what are the pieces of data or all the pieces of data in the system that we need to actually list a home. And then how do we use those throughout our whole system in different ways? And then anytime you have to change those things. So that could be little simple things like truncating the length of the title of an Airbnb home when it's listed on the platform. You're going to have mad hosts, you're going to have design changes that need to be made to make sure that they can actually display something in a different way. It gets just inherently more complex the more complex your system is. So that is probably a terribly described way of describing second order thinking.

Lenny (00:44:01):
That makes total sense. And that's something we dealt with it, sorry to interrupt, but that's like on the host team, we dealt with this question often of just any change you make and the listing flow is going to impact so much of the experience of a host and a guest. And so that makes total sense. Sorry, keep going.

Nickey Skarstad (00:44:16):
Yeah. No, and I think that forcing yourself and your team to think in that way is just a really good thinking exercise because it will save you time and it will save you money, a lot of money later, if you don't constantly have to rebuild things when you want to make changes to your system later. And that ladders up again into having a very clear vision and a strategy. Because what you're doing is you're starting to think on the long horizon. And so the decisions that you're making today are in service of that long horizon. So you can actually build in that direction and you don't constantly have to rebuild every time you're trying to change something.

Lenny (00:44:50):
On the second order thinking, sorry, I called it second order decision, but in this framework that you spoke of, how do you actually operationalize this concept? When you're planning, do you write out in the document second order impact that we should be thinking about, or do you do something else?

Nickey Skarstad (00:45:05):
Yeah. So I think there's many ways to do this. If you have a spec-ed template or a piece of documentation that your team typically use when they're writing out product strategy or product requirements, et cetera, you can put a line in here to force people to think about it. I also think thinking about first principles and writing out first principles for the changes that you're making often are in service of second order thinking. Where it's like here are the things that we care about. Here's why these things are important. And we want to make sure these are baked into what we're building. Typically you'll write those through the lens of second order thinking.

(00:45:36):
Shopify uses first principles a lot in everything that they build. And this is something I took away from that way of working because it's extremely effective. If you can get teams to align on first principles early on, it saves you a lot of heartache later because you've got people to align way early days before you even got into the design process, or before you had to start thinking about how do we actually technically implement this.

(00:45:56):
And then the other way I would say is there's ways to structure or have thoughtful discussion around second order effects. That could be a brainstorm. You could use Miro to think about that. We're going to make these changes today. How do they cascade through our ecosystem? What are the gotchas or the things we need to worry about? And again, I think the more complex your ecosystem is, the more you are forced to do this. A lot of founders in early stage products don't think like this because they're so focused on the product market fit. We need to just get something that people are using. That then when they get product market fit, they realize when they get into scale mode, they didn't build something scalable, and they have to rebuild things which can actually really hurt them when they're trying to grow really quickly later on.

Lenny (00:46:35):
Yeah. Absolutely. Happens all the time. For principles, do you put those in to say the team strategy, like the quarterly strategy document? Like here's our principles for the quarter? Is that how you generally do that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:46:47):
Yeah. I think that is a great place to put it. You can write them on the feature level too. So something that you're building, just getting clearer on here are the things that matter to us. Here's what we care about. We're going to design in service of these things. And here are the things that aren't that important. And again, those are the types of places in a product requirements doc where people will argue the most, which is a good thing because you're basically discussing and debating sort of foundations of what you're going to build before you get into the work of building it. And so those exercises are always a good idea.

Lenny (00:47:16):
Awesome. I love that. Okay. So going back, because I wanted to close this thread, you've come up with your vision, your mission, your strategy, your goals as a team. People start to align around it. What do you do to kick it off and get people on board and aware of the plan, and then to stay on plan with that strategy and not kind of be distracted by new priorities and shiny objects?

Nickey Skarstad (00:47:38):
Yes. Oh, the shiny object thing is very real. Good question. So for example, I just did this recently where I brought my team along through the OKR process for Q2 planning. They had a say in basically what we decided we were going to work on. It went up for leadership approval. We got approval. And my process was I used Loom, which is another one of my favorite products. It's just a really easy screen share and video recording tool that you can share with teams. And so I just recapped, "All right, here's what I presented to leadership. Here are the feedback that we got. Here's the strategic feedback that we got. And here are the changes we're going to make. Any questions, let me know." And I posted it in Slack.

(00:48:10):
So I was just trying to keep the feedback loop really quick and tight with teams rather than wait till the next meeting you have with them a week later. I was like, all right, I'm going to just try to spend five minutes recording this and get it out ASAP. And that helps because then it gets people excited. Okay, cool. This thing that I worked on got really great feedback from leadership, and now we're working on it. I'm excited to get going.

(00:48:29):
And then it depends. Usually depending on the project, I have some sort of kickoff. I don't usually do a quarterly kickoff or anything like that because I think there's usually disparate teams owning different parts of strategy. But usually having a good weekly team meeting where you're really thoughtful about cascading feedback down from leadership, constantly checking in on what are we trying to do here? What is our strategy? How are these goals that we set laddering up? Are we achieving it? Are we not? Whatever. Having a meeting like that where you're kind of constantly talking about it each week also helps people feel bought in and not get distracted.

(00:48:59):
And actually I found that teams who are very bought to your vision and strategy are less distractable. Where I usually have more trouble is with leadership that aren't necessarily in the weeds with your team every day. And I'll get an idea. "Have you thought about doing this one random obscure thing?" "Yes. However, it's not in service of this long term plan, so we don't want to do that right now because we don't think it's the best use of our time."

Lenny (00:49:23):
Got it. And the way you're describing it, this is as a manager of product managers-

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:27):
Yep.

Lenny (00:49:28):
... versus an ICPM? Cool. So as an ICPM, I imagine you would do a quarterly kickoff, or whatever your cycle length. You kick off with the team. Here's what we're doing. Any questions?

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:38):
Totally.

Lenny (00:49:40):
Okay. Another thing I wanted to make sure we have time to chat about is product review meetings and process. Just kind of like how do you, as a product leader, make sure that you're shipping great stuff that you're proud of and that your leaders aren't surprised by? How do you design just a product review and design process.

Nickey Skarstad (00:49:56):
Yeah. So I have a lot of strong feelings on product reviews. And it's because I've been in a lot of different organizations and I've seen a lot of bad ways of doing this honestly. And I think it also depends on the product that you're building and the team that you've created. So I don't think that there's one right or wrong way to do this.

(00:50:12):
Where I've seen them fail is when they happen at the function level, and they're not done or shared as a team. Typically it's normal to have a design review or to have some sort of technical review. And the more you can try to bring those different review processes into one central moment to check in, the better it tends to go. Because what happens is you'll have feedback in a vacuum. The design leader will give the designer feedback, and then you don't hear about it. Or there'll be some technical flaw that happens in a very specific technical review that doesn't get back to the larger team.

(00:50:43):
So finding ways to make sure that those parts of your process are shared across each function, and you attend them and prepare for them as a team, I think really helps a lot of that. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a design review. Of course you should. I mean, you should just be really thoughtful about having moments, especially if there are moments where you're blessing something to move forward, to making sure the whole team is there. And that there's a very strategic check-in process to get those things approved that everyone knows about and is a part of.

Lenny (00:51:11):
Is that a meeting that you do weekly and you invite the designer and the engineer? Who do you invite, I guess, and what is the goal of that meeting? The goal of that meeting, I imagine, is approved the product to go launch and build.

Nickey Skarstad (00:51:23):
Yeah. And I think especially going back to the one way, two way door moment, giving teams autonomy to ship some things that you think are two way doors and aren't necessarily mission critical are important to your vision, but aren't going to conflate with the larger system, I think trying to keep things quick and not have too many barriers for people to ship is incredibly important. So you'll have to figure that out for your own org and it's nuances, but that is something that is important.

(00:51:49):
But when there are moments where you think it is basically a feedback gate, where it's a gate you need to walk through and a specific moment in time where you've gotten feedback, I think having a cross-functional meeting where there's a clear pre-read or something that's sent before. It's like, here's what we're talking about today. And then aligning on, do we think this meets our goals and does this meet our quality bar? And doing that in a really thoughtful way just so the team gets feedback. So the leadership is plugged in, but also so you're not standing the way of people shipping their products.

Lenny (00:52:17):
And then do you check in throughout the process of the product being built, or do you kind of encourage teams to get to a point where it's basically ready for approval?

Nickey Skarstad (00:52:26):
Yeah. Ideally in a perfect world, there's three check-in moments. There is the first principles check-in. What are you trying to build, or what are you trying to do? What are the sort of foundations that you're going to build on? What is the most important thing? What are you solving for? Getting approval on that, weirdly, is almost the most important thing. Because it saves a lot of teams a lot of time when they get later in their feedback review process and people are like, "You're not solving for the right thing." So that's important.

(00:52:49):
Once you've aligned on that, then it's like, all right, what approach are we going to use? What are we going to build? And that's sort of how we solve the problem. Making sure that there is a technical component there too so there's some sort of infrastructure review or architecture review, or whatever you want to call it. And then it's like, all right, this is ready to ship. Let's check in again. Do we think it's ready? And I think that, again, it depends on your organization. If you have a very small team, you might be very plugged in and these things might not need to happen. But in bigger organizations, especially where leadership isn't always able to be in the room, making sure that you have a clear checking in a few times to make sure that everyone is moving in the right direction and everyone feels good is, I think, a worthwhile exercise.

Lenny (00:53:27):
I love that. Such a simple framework. And then one last question along those lines, do you leave it up to the team to schedule these meetings, or are you pulling it out of them and making sure they schedule it?

Nickey Skarstad (00:53:36):
Today, because the team that I'm working on is pretty small, and we're pretty pre-product market fit, we're not doing a ton of very formal check-in moments because we don't need to be. Because it's a small team and we're all cruising together. But in bigger orgs that I've worked in, for Shopify, for example, there was a process around having these meetings and who would be there. And so those would kind of be scheduled through the larger processor system that they were working in, which really worked for them actually. And I think it allowed teams to be pretty autonomous on the day to day, but just making sure that there was feedback coming of from their users as well as from leadership.

Lenny (00:54:08):
Got it. One last question before we get to our exciting lightning round. And it's something that I've been thinking a lot about recently, which is around remote work as a product manager. I left Airbnb before COVID, and so I never lived in this world of everything is remote and product managing remotely. Is there anything you've picked up or learned that has been really helpful to being a product leader in a remote world?

Nickey Skarstad (00:54:30):
Yeah. I would say last couple years have just been a huge shift in my ways of working. I sort of grew up as a PM in IRL environments where we did the majority of our work together in the same room. So that was whiteboarding, having a quick sync after you had an in person meeting to finalize some details or keep hashing out a problem. It's so cheesy and overhyped, but the proverbial water cooler moment where you see somebody, and you're like, "Hey, how are you doing, Hey, did you hear about this thing?" All of those things literally went away overnight.

(00:55:01):
And I think especially the job of a PM, it's hard under normal times because you are doing so much labor to make sure people are informed and give feedback, et cetera. And then overnight you took away a lot of the methods that they were using to do it. And so I think that has been a pretty profound shift for a lot of people working in product roles.

(00:55:21):
The good news is there's a ton of new tools and new technology that's actually being built right now that's majorly helpful for this. So I use Slack in very new ways today than I did two years ago. Things like just making sure to post more asynchronous updates. Trying to actually take the burden off of an IRL or a Zoom meeting. Can we talk about this asynchronously and do it in Slack? Slack has this really great feature called huddles where you can just quickly get on. It's just audio. So there's no video. And you can just have a 30 second conversation. It's good for standups and things like that. Suggest you try it if you haven't yet.

(00:55:56):
And then a lot of the old in person whiteboarding, things like that, you can do those now using awesome tools like Miro and FigJam. And I feel like, especially at Airbnb, we had such an international team that there was always somebody who was remote typically. And I think we never really got the remote experience right. And now that the majority of our teams are remote, I'm a fully remote person, I've been a lot more thoughtful about making sure we're creating a really good experience of how we're working for the larger team. And so I think you have to hack on this with your team. Different teams have different ways of working, but trying to be a synchronous, using Slack, making sure you're following up in very visible ways where people can see. Don't rely on Zoom meetings to fill all of your time. Otherwise people will literally hate you. And things like that really make a huge difference.

Lenny (00:56:43):
Awesome. Super helpful. All right. Nickey, are you ready for the lightning round?

Nickey Skarstad (00:56:48):
I'm ready. Let's do this.

Lenny (00:56:49):
What's a book that you recommend most to other product managers?

Nickey Skarstad (00:56:53):
I love Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows.

Lenny (00:56:57):
Awesome. Okay. We're going to link to that in the description. Other than Duolingo, what's another company that you recommend the PMs go work at or explore when they're looking for a new gig?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:07):
Yeah, I would say Etsy hands down.

Lenny (00:57:09):
And why is that?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:10):
I think it's a great place to learn how to be a PM. Data driven, really supportive, product leadership, and a super fun product to build.

Lenny (00:57:18):
Awesome. Love that. What's the current favorite kind of app or piece of software that helps you do your work better?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:25):
I'm obsessed with Superhuman, which is a email productivity app, which once you start using it, you can't not use it. You basically have to use it for the rest of your days. I also am obsessed with Loom, which is a video recording tool that makes it really easy to share really quick video updates.

Lenny (00:57:41):
Awesome, great choices. And then outside of work, what's a current favorite app or just piece of software that you love?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:47):
Definitely TikTok. Short form video is very fun and entertaining. Can't get enough of it, and have been creating some myself. So I'm definitely hooked.

Lenny (00:57:56):
While we're on that topic, how do people find you on TikTok?

Nickey Skarstad (00:57:58):
Yeah, it's just my name. It's Nickey Skarstad, and give me a follow.

Lenny (00:58:03):
I'm a very happy follower. And then I'll link to that in description too. Who's a favorite person that you like to follow on either Twitter, or Instagram, or even TikTok?

Nickey Skarstad (00:58:12):
Yeah, so I love, she is a cultural journalist, her name is Anne Helen Petersen. And she's really plugged into sort of the larger cultural zeitgeist of the time. And I always give people, when people ask me my top advice for new PMs, it's just to be a consumer. To download new products, to try them out, to use all the things and try them because I think it actually makes you a better product builder. And follow people that are not just tech people on Twitter. You are doing yourself a disservice if your entire feed is tech people. So find people that are plugged into cultural zeitgeist because it helps you also understand the moment in which you are shipping, and it'll make sure that you're acing your product marketing and your messaging and you're building the right thing.

Lenny (00:58:53):
What's her name again?

Nickey Skarstad (00:58:54):
Her name is Anne Helen Petersen.

Lenny (00:58:56):
Anne Helen Petersen. Love it. Okay. And then final question. Who's been your favorite manager?

Nickey Skarstad (00:59:01):
Yeah, so I couldn't pick one person here, so don't be mad. But it's actually a lot of women that I worked for at Etsy. The majority of my entire reporting line the time that I was there was all women, which has never happened to me again. So shout out to Kruti Patel, who is their current chief product officer, a woman named Heather Jassy, who ran the community team at Etsy long ago, who was a true delight to work for. And then Linda Findley, who is now the CEO of Blue Apron, but she was the chief operating officer at my time at Etsy. And she was my boss for a bit. And she was wonderful.

Lenny (00:59:31):
Amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. And thank you so much for joining me, Nickey, for doing this. Where can people find you online? And then just generally, how can people that are listening to this be helpful to you?

Nickey Skarstad (00:59:43):
Yeah, so I have newly become obsessed with TikTok, like I said before. I've been creating some fun, little short form videos. One of my regrets as a long time product builder is it's very time consuming to write down the stories of building products and to share them. But I found TikTok actually really easy to do that. So I'm going to try to experiment there a little bit more.

(01:00:01):
So you can follow me, I'm @NickeySkarstad on TikTok. And then I have a newsletter. I call it Builders. It's nickey.substack.com. Nickey is spelled like Mickey Mouse, but with an N. N-I-C-K-E-Y, .substack.com. And I publish their occasionally. I need to get it going again. But again, trying to write down more of the stories of actually being a builder who's been doing this for a long time. Because a lot of us don't have a lot of time to actually talk about it, but it's really interesting work and I want to share it more.

Lenny (01:00:29):
Awesome. I'm a follower and a subscriber to both. So highly recommend that.

Nickey Skarstad (01:00:29):
I love it.

Lenny (01:00:33):
And thank you so much, Nickey.

Nickey Skarstad (01:00:34):
Yeah. Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny (01:00:35):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# How to measure AI developer productivity in 2025 | Nicole Forsgren

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:03):
Most productivity metrics are a lie. If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever. It's just too easy to gain that system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
How do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can?

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:18):
Most teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
One of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is learning how much to trust code that it generates.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:32):
We can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it. Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
So much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:45):
There's some real opportunity there to not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work. Now, we can also make a 45-minute work block useful because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by, reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:01:09):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Nicole Forsgren. With so much talk about how AI is increasing developer productivity, more and more people are asking, "How do we measure this productivity gain? And are these AI tools actually helping us or hurting how our developers work?" Nicole has been at the forefront of this space longer than anyone. She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE. She wrote the most important book in the space called Accelerate and is about to publish her newest book called Frictionless, which gives you a guide to helping your team move faster and do more in this emerging AI world. Her core thesis is that AI indeed accelerates coding. But developers aren't speeding up as much as you think because they still have to deal with broken builds and unreliable tools and processes, and a bunch of new bottlenecks that are emerging.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we chat about her current, best and very specific advice for how to measure productivity gains from AI, signs that your team could be moving faster, what companies get wrong when trying to measure engineering productivity, how AI tools are both helping and hurting engineers, including getting into flow states, her seven-step process for setting up a developer experience team at your company, how to get buy-in and measure the impact of a team like this and a ton more. This episode is for anyone looking to improve the performance of their engineering teams.

Nicole, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:16):
Thank you. It's so good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
It's so good to have you back. I was just watching our first episode, which we did two and a half years ago. I was watching it, and I was both shocked and not shocked that we barely talked about AI. The episode was called How to Measure and Improve Developer Productivity, and we got to AI barely like an hour in and we're just like, "Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen with AI and productivity." Does that just blow your mind?

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:41):
Yeah. Because it was just hitting the scene, it was the topic of so much conversation, and at the same time, so many things don't change. So many things are still important, so many things are the same. Yeah. It's also a little wild that it's been two and a half. Where does time go? Time is a social construct?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:01):
Yeah. Most of our conversation was just questions like, "Well, how might this impact people? How will we change the way we build product?" It was barely a thing back then. Now, it's the only thing that I imagine people want to talk about when they talk about engineering productivity. That's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time focusing on today. The reason I'm excited about this conversation, it feels like there's been so much money poured into AI tools increasing productivity. The fastest growing companies in the world are these engineering AI tools. And now, more and more people are just asking this question of just, "What gains are we getting out of this? How much is this actually helping us be more productive? How do we become more productive?"

(00:06:39):
You've been at the center of this world for longer than anyone. You've invented so many of the frameworks that people rely on now. So I'm really excited to have you back to talk about this stuff. I want to start with just this term DevEx, it's something that comes up a lot in this whole space, and we're going to hear this term a bunch in this conversation. Can you just explain what is DevEx, this term DevEx?

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:00):
DevEx is developer experience. And when we think about developer experience, we're really talking about what it's like to build software, day to day, for a developer. So the friction that they face, the workflows that they have to go through, any support that they have. It's important because when DevEx is poor, everything else just isn't going to help. The best processes, the best tools, the best... whatever magic you have, if the DevEx is bad, everything kind of takes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):
Within DevEx is productivity, and I think the key insight that you had and other folks in the space of that is not just productivity, but there's also engineering happiness. We're going to get into a lot of these parts, but just maybe speak to... there's productivity and there's broader components to engineers being successful at a company.

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:51):
Yeah. I love that point because productivity, first of all, is hard to define anyway. But if you're just looking at output, you can get there in a lot of different ways. But if you're getting there in ways that are high toil or high friction, then at some point, a developer is going to burn out. Or if it's super high cognitive load, if it's hard to even think about what you're doing because concentrating on the mechanics of... the plumbing of something, then you don't have the brain space left to come up with really innovative solutions and questions. So I love that it's kind of this self-reinforcing loop in terms of, "You do more work, you do better work." And it's better for people, it's better for the systems, it's better for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:34):
I was going to get to this later, but I want to actually get to this right now, this idea of flow state for engineers. I was an engineer, actually, early in my career. I went to a school for computer science. I was an engineer for 10 years. The best part of the job for me was just this flow state you enter when you're coding and building, and just things feel like so fun. It feels like AI is making that harder in a lot of ways because there's all these agents you're working with now, there's all this code that's kind of being written for you. Talk about just the importance of flow state to a developer, happiness, developer productivity, and just what you've seen AI impacting. How you've seen AI impacting that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:09:07):
Well, there are lots of different ways to talk about DevEx. One way to talk about it is kind of three key things that have components that are important of themselves, and they also kind of reinforce each other. Flow state is one of them, cognitive load is another, and then feedback loops are another. I think when you touch on this... Your question about flow state is a really good one, and I'll admit we're just a few years into this. We're still figuring out what the best flow state and cognitive requirements are for people in this because, to your point, sometimes we're getting interrupted all the time. You don't just get in the flow and lock down, and write a whole bunch of code and do the typing of a whole bunch of code as much anymore. Instead, you're kind of creating a prompt, getting some code back and reviewing the code, trying to integrate what's happening in the system, and that can really interrupt.

(00:10:02):
At the same time though, it can contribute to flow if... I've seen some senior engineers pull together some tool chains that are really incredible, where they figured out how to keep the flow going. The fast feedback loops really, really work well for them. They can kind of assign out different pieces to agents. It helps them keep in the flow in terms of... Instead of details and line-by-line writing, they're in the flow in terms of, "What's my goal? What are the pieces that I need to get there? How quickly can I get there? So then, I can step back and kind of evaluate everything, and then dive back in and fix some pieces."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Is there anything more you could say about this engineer that figured out this really cool workflow, about just what that looks like?

Nicole Forsgren (00:10:39):
I've spoken with a handful of them, and I've kind of watched them work. I haven't built it myself yet. It's on my list. They've been able to set up this really incredible workspace and workflow where... Right now, a lot of us play around with tools and... We'll put in a prompt and we'll get a few lines back or maybe we'll put in a prompt and we'll get whole programs back. Well, what they can do is they can... Many times I'll see them say, to help prime it, "This is what I want to build. It needs to have these basic architectural components. It needs to have this kind of a stack. It needs to follow this general workflow. Help me think that through," and it'll kind of design it for it. And then for each piece, it'll assign an agent to go work on each pace in parallel, and then it'll say and upfront, "These need to be able to work together, make sure it's architected correctly. Make sure we use appropriate APIs and conventions."

(00:11:30):
Then at the end, they can let it run for a few minutes. They can think through something else that's interesting or they anticipate is going to be hairy, and they come back to something that's probably a little better than vibe coded. Because they were so systematic about it upfront, they're much closer to something that looks like production code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:51):
So what I'm hearing is spending a little time upfront planning, what all these AI engineers are doing, versus just powering through and just figuring out as you go.

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
Okay, cool. Let me get to this quite a core question that I think on is a lot of people's minds. A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams, "Is this improving our productivity? Is this hurting our productivity?" So let me just start with this question, how are people doing this wrong currently when they try to measure their productivity gains with AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:23):
I'll say most productivity metrics are a lie. It's really tricky because, historically... Now, look, lines of code has always been a bad metric, but many folks still use lines of code-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):
[inaudible 00:12:37].

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:37):
... yeah, as some proxy as some proxy for output or productivity or complexity or something. Well, now, for many of the systems, that they would sometimes whisper and not super talk about that uses lines of code, it's just blown out of the water because, "What do you mean by lines of code?" If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever and add tons of comments. We know that agents and LLMs tend to be very verbose by definition, and so it's just too easy to gain that system and then introduce complexity and technical debt into all of the work that you're doing. I will say there are some things that we can kind of watch and pay attention to because... So lines of code as a productivity metric isn't great, it's pretty bad. But now, it's kind of more relevant if we can tease out which code came from people and which code came from AI because now we can answer downstream questions.

(00:13:40):
"What is the code survivability rate? What is the quality of our code? Is our code being fed back into trained systems? And for that code that's retraining systems later, especially if we're doing fine-tuning and local tuning, how much of that is machine generated? What types of loops is that creating, and what types of patterns or biases might it be inadvertently introducing?" On the one hand, it's not good as a productivity metric, but it can be useful. I'll even say the same for DORA. I have done DORA metrics, their speed metrics, their stability metrics. If that's all you're looking at, it's not going to be sufficient anymore because AI has now changed the way we think about feedback loops. They need to be much faster. Now, what DORA's meant for, kind of assessing the pipeline overall in terms of speed and stability. Still, that works. But we can't just blindly apply the existing metrics we've used before because we'll miss super important phenomenon and changes in the way people work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:38):
Interesting. You invented DORA, that was kind of the main framework people used for a long time to measure productivity. And then there's SPACE, there's Core 4, there's probably others. So what I'm hearing here is all these are kind of out of date now, where AI is contributing large portions of code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:14:55):
I will say if it is a prescriptive metric, it needs to be used only in the way it was prescribed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:00):
So

Nicole Forsgren (00:15:01):
DORA 4, there are four key metrics. There's two speed metrics, deployment frequency and lead time. So code commit to code deploy. There's stability metrics, MTTR and change fail rate. If those are used to assess the speed of the pipeline and the general performance of the pipeline, that's great. If you're trying to use those to understand... Because implied in that is feedback loops, right, because you used to kind of get feedback from customers. But we can't just use that blindly now when we're using AI, as an example, because we have feedback loops much earlier and not even just at the local build and test phase. We have feedback loops throughout, and even sometimes in the middle of some of the pipeline, that we really want to leverage in ways that weren't as useful before. I won't say they weren't possible, but we just didn't really focus there.

(00:15:53):
So those are prescriptive metrics. When we think about SPACE, SPACE is a framework. It doesn't tell you what metric to use. So I'll say, sometimes people get real frustrated because I didn't tell them what to measure. But now, I think that's the power of it. We're actually seeing that SPACE applies fairly well in these new emerging contexts like AI because we still want to look at... SPACE is an acronym. We still want to look at satisfaction. We still want to look at performance, what's the outcome. We still want to look at activity. Yes, in some ways, lines of code and number of PRs can be useful for something, or number of alerts or number of things, activities or counts. Seize communication and collaboration, this is also super important and useful because it's how our systems communicate with each other, and also how our people do. "What proportion of work is being offloaded to a chat bot versus talking to a senior engineer on the team?" More isn't always better and less isn't always better, it depends.

(00:16:50):
And then efficiency and flow, "Can people get in the flow? How much time does it take to do things? What is the flow like through our system?" Here, I would probably add a couple of dimensions. So chatting with some of the early authors to say trust. Not to say trust wasn't important before, but now it's very, very front of mind. Right? Before you build your code, if the compile comes back, you're fine. And that's the way it is. LLMs are non-deterministic. Right now, we can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it, so, "Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write? And if it doesn't meet, is that fine?" So it depends on... Prescriptive. You got to make sure you're using it fit for purpose. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
We're going to get to your current thinking on the best way to do this stuff. You have a book coming out that explains how to do this well, so we're going to get to that. One thing I wanted to highlight in our last chat that we had, you highlighted that one of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is trust, understanding and learning how much to trust the code that it generates, and also how much... you said this, two and a half years ago, that so much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code. That's exactly what I'm hearing.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:10):
I think it'll be interesting to see how that impacts the way we structure work moving forward. We were talking about flow state and cognitive load. Now that our attention has to focus on things at certain times and it's broken up from how we used to do it, I think there's some real opportunity there to, not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:31):
Can you say more about that? Just what is that? What are you thinking will be happening? Where do you think things go? What are you seeing working?

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:37):
This is purely speculative. But for example, Gloria Mark has done some really good work on attention and deep work, and humans can get about four hours of good deep work a day. That's about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:52):
Yeah,. I feel that.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:54):
That's kind of the upper limit-ish for the most part, and I'm sure people are going to be like, "Well, I am superhuman and I can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
What if you take 20 grams of creatine?

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:01):
Right. What if we microdose?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Yeah, exact;y.

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:06):
Yeah. So in the context of knowing we have about four hours of good deep work... I'm sure many of us have probably hit this, right? We have good periods. Maybe it's morning, maybe it's afternoon for folks. And then you hit a time where you're like, "I'm going to clean up my inbox because that is all I can do right now. I can be functional, but I'm not going to come up with my best innovative, problem solving, authoring, code writing work." A lot of times, the way to do that and to get into it is to have these long chunks to get into flow and to get that deep work. Usually, I'm [inaudible 00:19:43] two hours-ish. An hour can be tricky because it could take time to get into that state. Okay. Well, when we think about what it used to be like, back in the old days, three years ago, three and a half years ago, we could block off four hours of time and we could probably get two or three hours of really good work done. Because we were just focused, right? There were no interruptions, minimal interruptions.

(00:20:05):
Now, the nature of writing code and systems itself is interrupt driven or full of interruptions, at least, because you start something and then it interjects. So how do we think about that? Does that mean that a four-hour word block is still useful? Probably. But does that mean that now we can also make a 45-minute work block useful? Because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system and all the things. So I think that's a really, really interesting area that's just ripe for questions and opportunity. And please, folks, do this research and come back to me because... It might not make my list, but it's such a great question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
That is so interesting. Essentially, every engineer is turning into an EM, engineering manager, coordinating all of these junior AI engineers. So your point is even if you have a 30-hour block, you can get deep into code, but you can unblock all these AI engineers that are running off doing tasks. Plus, your point is they remind you of just like, "Here's where you left off. Okay. You can just jump into this code, maybe make some tweaks."

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):
So interesting. Let me zoom out a little bit and... Before we get into your framework for how to approach developer experience, the latest thinking you've got, beyond just obviously engineers doing more is great, what's your best pitch for why companies should really, really focus on developer experience?

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:37):
I hate to say return of investment, but the business value is... the opportunity here is huge. In general, we write software for fun and for hobbies, but we also have software because it meets a business need. It helps us with market share, it helps us attract and retain customers, it helps us do all of these things. And I think DevEx is important because it enables all of that software creation, it enables all of that problem solving. It enables the super rapid experimentation with customers that... Before, you'd need a while for a prototype and maybe a little bit longer to actually flight it through an A/B test on a production system. You can do it in hours, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):
Maybe the opposite end of the spectrum, getting very tactical, before we get into the larger framework, what's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to help their developer experience maybe get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:22:35):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. I love that the audience of this podcast is primarily PMs because they tend to be really good at this. And I would say start with listening and not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, "Well, I'm just going to build this tool," or, "I'm going to build this thing." Often you build a thing that you yourself have had a challenge with or that is easy to do, easy to automate. And if you just go talk to people and ask the developers like, "Think of yesterday, what did you do yesterday? Walk me through it. What were the points that were just delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you get slowed down? Where was there friction?" If you go talk to a handful of people, a lot of times, you can surface a handful of things that are relatively low lift and still have impact or you can identify a process that's unnecessarily complex and slow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:36):
So the listening to, I hear, almost is you want to help your teams move faster and be happier eng teams. Your advice is just, "Before you do anything, just go ask them what is bothering you."

Nicole Forsgren (00:23:46):
Go ask them, yeah. And trust me, most developers are going to be more than happy to tell you what's broken and what's bad. I'll say, there was one company that I had worked with. I remember they had a process that was really difficult and it was on an old mainframe system, and they were going to have to replat the whole thing and so they never went to work on it or talk about it. Everyone hated it because it was this huge delay. I mean, all they had to do was change a process. Sometimes all you have to do is change a process. And they changed it so that instead of... I think someone had to print it out and walk it down three or four flights, and they get approval. And then someone else had to walk it back up, and so it was just that interim. They didn't replat anything. They didn't redesign anything major. They just sent an email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Let me push on that and... I'm curious just what are the most common things people do. If you're just starting on, "Okay, we need to focus on engineering experience," what do you find are the most... two or three most common improvements companies need to make?

Nicole Forsgren (00:24:45):
I'll say, I'll kind of echo that process, there's almost always a process that can be improved and that can be improved without a lot of engineering lift or a lot of engineering headcount. Most large companies, in particular, have something that is several, several steps. It's the way it is because it's the way it is, but that's no longer the way it is. And even small companies sometimes is just a little too YOLO, and you don't know what it is and you're kind of chasing everyone around. So if you can create a very lightweight process, that can also be helpful. That can be one of the best places to start, especially if you have limited exposure to the whole rest of the org. Sometimes just a team process can help.

(00:25:28):
I will say from a business leader's standpoint, a lot of what you can do is provide structure and support for this organizational change. Communicate what you're doing, communicate what the priorities are, communicate why this is important, to celebrate wins. Because if folks try to do this, just like a one-off side fully-isolated project, it's really challenging to get some good momentum, to get people to care, and to get them stay involved. Because it feels like it's just another internal project that isn't going to matter or that isn't going to get celebrated, but it has these huge upside potential returns for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):
It's interesting, what I'm hearing here is nothing about tools or technologies. It's not like move to this cloud, it's not like install this new deployment system, it's processes and people and org and morale.

Nicole Forsgren (00:26:24):
Yeah. Now, there will be technical pieces that are very important, especially now with AI, where we're rethinking how build and test systems work. We're rethinking feedback to users so that it's very, very customized in terms of what is shared and when it is shared. There are a lot of technical pieces that are involved, but that's not the only thing. It's necessary but not sufficient, and that doesn't have to be the place that you start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
I have a hard question I want to ask you that I thought of as you were talking. I feel like this is the question that most founders and heads think about. And the question is just like, how do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can? What are just maybe smells, signs that tell you, "Yeah, my team should be moving faster," versus, "This is just the way it works. This is as fast as they can move"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:27:16):
Most teams can move faster, right? Also, given what we know about cognitive load, not all speed gains are necessarily good. Or the upside is going to be kind of limited once you hit kind of a certain point, and most people are not even near that point. I don't know a single team, frankly. But how do you know? You know if you're always hearing about bills breaking, flaky tests, overly long processes, if you have to request a new system or if you need to provision a new environment, or if it's really, really hard to switch tasks or switch projects. So if someone has an opportunity to go work in another part of an org and they don't for reasons that are unclear, and not political, and anyone says anything about the system, that's usually a pretty good smell that there's friction somewhere.

(00:28:20):
Because once you finally figure out your system and you're able to get work done, the switching costs can often be really, really high to go anywhere else. So sometimes people will do that. But I've worked with companies where switching orgs within the company, you had to basically pay the same tax as a new hire because the systems were so different and they were so full of friction, and it was so difficult to do so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I love the first part of your answer especially, which is you can always move faster. I think every founder is going to love hearing that. To your point though, there's diminishing returns over time?

Nicole Forsgren (00:28:58):
Yeah. And you don't know about the quality, right? So I think that's the other side is that you can always move faster, but faster for what? Are we making the right business decisions? And I think that's especially where PMs come in. We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout. The strategy is the core piece, and then think about speeding that up. If we don't have the other pieces in place, I mean, garbage in, garbage out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
I want to follow that thread, but before I do that, just to mirror back what you shared. So signs that your team... There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to improve the productivity of your team as builds are always breaking. There's flaky tests are constantly incorrect, false positives. It's hard to context switch between different projects. You just hear people talking about the system, it's just really hard to work with. Is that roughly right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:29:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Cool, okay. So going back to the point you just made, there's a sense that AI is making teams so much faster because it's writing all this code for them. You're going to have all these asynchronous agents, engineers working for you. It feels like a core part of your message is that's just a one part of engineering work and there's so much more, including figuring out what to build... an alignment internally. Maybe just speak to just... There is a lot of opportunity to improve engineering performance productivity, but there's so many other elements that are not improved through AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:22):
Yes. Or could be in the future, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Mm-hmm.

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:26):
I think there are a lot of ways that we can pull in AI tools to help us refine our strategy, refine our message, think about the experimentation methods or targets of experimentation, or think about our total addressable market, but we need to have that strategy and plan fairly well aligned or at least have two or three alternatives that you want to test. Because now, the engineering can go, or at least the prototyping especially, much, much faster. We can throw out prototypes. We can run any tests and experiments that are customer facing, assuming that we have the infrastructure in place, which allows us to learn and progress much faster before. In some places, it used to take months to get something through production to do A/B testing and get feedback. We can do this in a day or two, definitely under a week. But we want to make sure that we're building and testing the right things, "Are we partnering with the right... Do we have the data that we need?"

(00:31:24):
And I will say AI can actually be a pretty good partner there if you have a good conversation with it, and then also check with you experts, "What type of data should I be looking at? What type of instrumentation do I need? What type of analysis can I do?" Because then, you can also go to your data science team and say, "I'm planning on doing this. I'd like to..." Let's not just YOLO A/B tests because that can be... It's a shame to do a large test and end up disrupting users or disrupting customers, or breaking privacy or security protocols and also end up with data that's unusable because you just can't get the signal that you're looking for. But now, I'm also seeing people kind of accelerate that into a few days versus a few weeks. So they can start those key stakeholder discussions from a much more informed kind of filled out space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy-to-organize tab.

(00:33:04):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A-dot-I-O-slash-Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.

(00:33:33):
I love that you work with a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different types of businesses. I think very few people get to see inside a lot of different places. What kind of gains are you just seeing in terms of increased productivity with AI? How big of a gain have you seen?

Nicole Forsgren (00:33:49):
I'd say it's real, and I would also say we don't have great measures for it yet. We're still trying to figure out what to measure and what that looks like. One of the best is going to be velocity, all the way through the system, how quickly can you get a feature or a product or something through the system so that you can then experiment a test, either from idea to final end or even kind of a feature and a piece through the system so we can test. That's really good. Now, that's also hard to tie back directly to a particular AI tool in the hands of a particular developer. But there are some other things that we can look at and we can see, and that I've seen is, again, this kind of rapid prototyping.

(00:34:36):
I hate lines of code, but I'm going to use the lines of code. We do see... I know I worked with some folks who had kind of a whole set of companies they were looking at, and they found that AI was generating significantly more code for the people who were using it regularly. But then, they also found that for folks who were regular users of AI coding environments, AI ADEs, the tool kind of gave them more code. And then the engineers themselves, the increase was double what the coding agent had given them. So one, I'd say, probably it's kind of a secondary or knock on or just a smell is it can unblock you. It can speed up the work that you would already do. I know sometimes when I work, the first few minutes, it's hard for me to start. But once I get started, I'm there. So they're really good at unblocking and unlocking that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):
Something I've seen people on Twitter sharing is how good OpenAI Codex, especially, is at finding really gnarly bugs. And I think it was Karpathy that shared it. He was so stuck on a bug and, no AI tool could figure it out. And then the latest version of Codex spent an hour or something, looking into it, and found it for him.

Nicole Forsgren (00:35:51):
Yeah. I'm hearing incredible things like that, right? Well, and even also writing unit tests and spinning up unit tests, and creating documentation and cleaning up documentation because I know now people are like, "Oh. Well, we have agents. I don't need to read the docs because there's the code there." It turns out, agents rely on good data because it's all about how they've been trained or how they've been grounded. And better data gives you better outcomes, and some of that data includes documentation and comments. The better documentation and the better comments you have, the better performance you're going to get out of your AI tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
And AI can help you write that documentation. I've been working with Devin a little bit, and it's really good at that stuff.

Nicole Forsgren (00:36:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
Okay. Let's talk about this framework, this book. So you're publishing a book called Frictionless, which sounds like a dream, "How do you create a dev team that's frictionless?" It's called Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the Age of AI. There's a seven-step process to this. Walk us through this and maybe give us just context on this book, who it's meant for, what problem it solves, and then the seven steps.

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:00):
I will say, I also wrote this with Abi Noda who has just... of DX. He has incredible experience in the space. He's worked with hundreds of companies and so it was kind of nice bouncing ideas off of him. Also, thanks to all of the engineering leads and DevEx leads, and CTOs, and engineers that we talked to to make sure that our smells were right. So who is this book for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
Let me take a tangent on Abi, and DX, since you mentioned him. This is super interesting, and I think it connects so directly with this conversation. Abi started this company called DX, which is such a great name for a company around developer experience. They just sold the company for a billion dollars to Atlassian. It's a very high multiple on their ARR. It, to me, shows exactly why this conversation is so valuable, just how much value companies are putting into improving developer experience. Atlassian would spend a billion dollars on this. It's an early stage-ish startup. It was doing really well and people loved it, but it was like early stage-ish, a billion dollars. And the idea is they have all these companies working using Jira and all their products. They're all trying to figure out how do we measure productivity. It's worth a lot of money to them. And I know you were an early advisor to them too, so-

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):
... it just shows us how important this is.

Nicole Forsgren (00:38:17):
Yeah. Well, I think it also shows us how much value you can get out of this. There's so much low-hanging fruit, there's so much unlocked potential, and it's hard to know where to start a lot of times even in... I've been at large companies that have a lot of expertise and a lot of really, really smart people. But if you haven't kind of been in this space and thinking about it this way, it's hard to know where to start or it's easy to make simple mistakes up front that mean you kind of need to start over later. So I guess it also brings us back to, "Who is this book for?" It's for anyone that cares about DevEx, so definitely technology leaders, anyone who's trying to kick off a DevEx program, or is working on a DevEx DevEx improvement program. I think it's particularly relevant for PMs because if you're PMing something that involves software building and creating software, improving DevEx will only help your team. And also, you have key skills and insights and instincts that are so important to DevEx that many times, I will say, I've seen engineering teams just miss.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Okay. What's the framework? What are the steps? Where do people start?

Nicole Forsgren (00:39:35):
The book goes through a seven-step process, and then also kind of provides some key kind of principles at the end. Step one is to start the journey. So assuming you're kicking off, you can start the journey. And this involves what we have already talked about. Go talk to people, have a listening tour, synthesize what you learn, visualize the workflow and tools, get a handle on what the current state is. Step two is to get a quick win. So start small, get a quick win, pick the right projects, share out what you've done. Step three is using data to optimize the work. So establish some of your data foundation, find the data that's there, start collecting new data, use some surveys for some really fast insights and may include example surveys. Step four then is to decide strategy and priority. Once you have some data, then you need to know of all the things that are potentially broken. And if you've already gotten your quick win of all the things that are left, "What should I do next?" So we walk through some evaluation frameworks there.

(00:40:43):
Step five is to sell your strategy. Once you've decided, now you have to kind of convince everyone else. So now you want to get feedback, you want to share why this is the right strategy right now. Step six is to drive change at your scale. So here, we address folks that have local scope of control. If you're starting on just a dev team, you want to do it yourself, kind of grassroots effort or global scope of control. If you're the VP of developer experience or something, there are some things that you can leverage for a top down, and then how do you drive change when you're kind of somewhere in the middle, because you can leverage both types of strategies. And then step seven is to evaluate your progress and show value, and then kind of loop back around.

(00:41:27):
I will say that we wrote this so that you could kind of jump into any step wherever you are right now. If you're kicking off a team or an initiative, you'll probably want to start at step one. You should definitely start at step one. If you're joining an existing initiative, you could jump into picking the priority or implementing the changes. So those are the seven steps. There's a seven steps, there are a few practices that we also recommend. So thinking about resourcing it, change management, making technology sustainable, and then also bringing a PM lens to this, "How can we think about developer experience as a product, and how do we think about the metrics that we have as a product?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):
Awesome, okay. I have questions. Point people to the book real quick. What's the URL? How do they get it? When does it come out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:18):
Yeah, developerexperiencebook.com. Right now, you can sign up for the mailing list. We'll let you know when it's out on pre-order, and we'll also be sharing pieces of the workbook. So we've got almost a hundred page workbook that goes along with the book, and then it should be out by end of year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
Okay. So one piece of this is just this term developer experience feels very intentional in that it's not developer productivity, developer work. It's how do we make developer experiences better at our company, which includes they get more done, but also they're happier and things like that. So I think that's an important element of this, right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):
Okay.

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:56):
Because, again, it's not just about productivity. We talked about this from the frame and the lens of, "We need to be building the right thing." And you want to be productive, but you also want to be thinking about... and this is what engineers are also just really incredibly good at, give them a problem and don't tell them how to solve it, and then they can solve it better. They have the freedom, they have the innovation, they have the creativity so that they can solve this problem. If it's only about productivity, then it's just lines of code or number PRs or whatever. But we really want to talk about value and how do we unlock value, and how do we get value faster. And that involves, yes, making them more productive and removing friction because then, they have the flow and the cognitive load and the things that we kind of talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:41):
Awesome, okay. And then say someone wants to start this team, what does it usually look like. At Airbnb, I remember this team forming. It was just like an engineer or two, getting it started and taking charge. What do you recommend as the pilot team, and then what does it look like as it grows?

Nicole Forsgren (00:43:57):
There are a few ways to do this, right? So if you're doing it yourself, you could do it with a couple of engineers, maybe a PM or a PGM or a TPM to kind of help communicate. Because really, comms plans are just so important here. On a small scale, what we want to do is look for those quick wins, look for things that you can do at small scale. Some folks call them things like paper cuts. There small things that you can do to help people see the value and feel the benefit themselves, "How can a developer's work get better? How can their day-to-day work get better? Kind of build momentum from there?" If you're working from a top-down structure and you have the remit, you still want some quick wins, but those quick wins can look a little more global in scale because you have the infrastructure or the backing to make different types of changes that aren't only local.

(00:44:56):
So an example of a small local change could be just cleaning up your tests, your test suites. Any team could do that, any team could do that. At more global scale, it might be changing organization-wide process that is just overly cumbersome or throwing some resourcing into cleaning up the provisioning environment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Okay. What kind of impact have you seen from teams like this forming, on the engineering teams at their companies?

Nicole Forsgren (00:45:21):
I'll say I've seen a huge impact for smaller companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars for large companies or in the billions. Well, also, we need to learn how to communicate that, "What does the math look like?" Many times, we can look at saving time, we can look at saving costs, we can look at a lot of different things. We can look at speed to value as speed to market. We can look at risk reduction, but the gains really are there. I will mention that it tends to follow something like the J-curve. So you'll have a couple of quick wins and it'll look like a big win, and then you'll hit kind of a little divot where suddenly the really obvious projects, the low-hanging fruit are handled. So now, we need to do a little bit of work. We might need to build out a little bit more infrastructure. We might need to build out a little more telemetry, so that we can capture the things we want to capture. And then once we get that done, then we start to see those benefits really compound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:16):
So going back to that measurement number, what do you recommend? How do people find these numbers? Because I think that's so much of the power of this is like, "We saved a million dollars doing this." What do you look at to figure that out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:46:28):
I think there are a few different things to keep in mind, like who is our key audience, and we usually have a few key audiences. We really want to be able to speak to developers because they're the ones that are going to be using the systems. They'll be partnering with you on either building them or at least providing feedback about what you're doing. So for them, we often want to frame this in terms of things they care about. So time savings. If something gets faster, they can save time. They don't spend time doing setup when they don't need to anymore, related to status reduced toil. So compliance and security are super important. Also, many times it requires several manual steps that... I don't say they're not value add. They're not value add from an individual human perspective. If we can automate as much as possible, that's great, and improved focus time.

(00:47:22):
That's from the developer side of you. Leadership often cares about... They care about those things, but they often care more about other things. So we could talk about usually costs in dollars, "Can we accelerate revenue? What does our time to value look like? What is our velocity? How quickly can we get feedback from customers?" And for folks and organizations that are in really competitive environments, that can be really compelling because it's all about speed. We could talk about saving money. Here, we can look at maybe quantifying savings. One example is test and build. If we can clean up a test and build suite to a developer, they really want to hear about time saved and more reliable systems. There's less toil because they don't have to keep re-running tests or kind of go clean up test suites.

(00:48:13):
From the business perspective, cleaning up a test in a build suite can be cloud cost savings because all of those tests are running somewhere on a cloud. And if they always fail or if it's just kind of a waste of spend, that can be useful, recovering some capacity. We can always talk about time and productivity gains, "How much equivalent developer time are we losing on things that are not necessarily value add?" And then sometimes we can correlate to business outcomes and correlate is usually the best we can do here, but there can be some pretty compelling correlations in terms of speeding up time to value and increase market share, for example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
Let me follow that thread and come back to this, what I think is the biggest question people have right now with AI and productivity, and I don't think anyone has the answer yet, but I'm curious to get your take of just what should people do today? What's the best approach to understanding what impact AI tools are having on their productivity? Because they're spending all this money on there. I don't know, what are we getting out of this? So I guess things are moving faster, but I don't know. So if someone had to just like, "Okay, here's what I should probably try to do," what would be your best advice here for measuring the impact of AI tools on productivity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:49:28):
I would say it depends. In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about. We are usually pretty good at figuring out what matters to developers and we could communicate that to them. But if we're trying to just identify two or three data points to really kind of focus on, because when we're first starting with data, sometimes it can be challenging, what do they care about? Think about the messaging you've been hearing. Have they been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed. Think about ways that you can capture metrics for speed from feature to production or feature to customer or feature to experiment and what that feedback loop looks like if they're talking about profit margin all the time.

(00:50:18):
Now, we always talk about money because this is business. But if that seems to be an overarching narrative, look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost. Or sometimes you'll reinvent, change a process, and then you no longer need as many vendors. So reductions in vendor spent can also help there. I say also it depends because sometimes they'll say something, leadership will say something, and it kind of comes up as a theme. If you could solve a problem that they have or it's something that they're focused on, if you can slightly reframe it even, like if they're calling everything developer productivity, go ahead and call it productivity. If they're calling it velocity, and velocity is what matters to them, think about how to frame this in terms of velocity. If they're talking about transformation or disruption, how does this help with the disruption? Because then, it will resonate with them. We don't want to make them work to understand what it is that we're doing and the value that we provide.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
That is such good advice. Just to reflect back, the advice here is if your company's trying to figure out what sort of impact are AI tools having on our company, first, it's just like, what does the company care about most? What do leaders care about most? Could be market share, could be profit margin, could be velocity. We need higher velocity or we need to transform, transformation. So your advice there is figure that out based on words and phrases you're hearing. Then figure out ways to measure that, ways to measure market share growing, profit margin increasing. I love these examples, like time from feature, idea to production or to experiment, so maybe start tracking that. If it's margin, it's money saved by fewer tests, failing or some vendor you don't have to pay for, things like that. And then velocity, I imagine that's where things like DORA come in of just speed of engineering, shipping, or... What would you think about there for velocity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:52:16):
I would say it's actually one of those... I would pick as broad a swathe as you can. So if you can go from idea to customer or idea to experiment, how long does that take? How long does it typically take, and how long can it take, and does it take now with improved use of AI tooling and reduction in friction? That's where I will say, we talk about this a little bit in the book, how do we deal with attribution challenges? What was responsible for this? Was it the DevEx or was it AI? Go ahead and disclose that. Say, "Yes, we rolled out AI tools. We also had this effort in DevEx. They partnered very closely together." Both of them probably contributed to this, right? If we had AI tools without the DevEx improvements, we probably would've had some improvements, but not nearly as much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):
If people were starting to do this today, say they're just like, "I want to start measuring developer experience," are there a two or three metrics everybody basically needs they should just start measuring ASAP?

Nicole Forsgren (00:53:10):
If you're just starting today and if you have nothing at all, talk to people, obviously. After that, I would do surveys because surveys can give you a nice overall view of the landscape quickly so that you know where the big kind of challenges are. I say that because if you're just starting, you might not have instrumentation through your system, all the metrics. And if you do already, it might not be what you think you want. Metrics that were designed without purpose, questionable. Metrics that were designed for another purpose, they might work for what you want, but they might not, so we can't just assume we have them. That's one reason I like surveys, and we include an example in the book. You can just ask a few questions, "How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?" and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three.

(00:54:12):
Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly? Because sometimes it hits you every single day, and you're just mad about it. Sometimes it only hits you once a quarter because it's end of quarter, but it's so onerous, and then kind of open text, like, "Is there anything else we should know?" That can give you incredible signal because by making folks prioritize the top three things... Let them pick everything, it makes the data super, super messy. But three things and how often, you can just come up with a score or a weighted score if you want, and then go kind of dig into, where should that data be? What data do we need? But also, then you've got at least some kind of baseline. It'll be a subjective baseline, but now you'll know what the biggest challenges are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
I love how all this just comes back just starting by talking to people and asking them these things, which is very similar to product management and just building great products is, have you talked to your customers? Everyone thinks they're doing this, but most people are not doing this enough.

Nicole Forsgren (00:55:17):
And I will say one thing that's challenging when you think about getting data, so interviews are data and that's important, surveys are a little more quantified because we can turn it into counts, but that's where we also want to be careful. A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, "Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?" You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something? So it can be really difficult to untangle what the signal is you're actually getting there, and so it is worth the time chatting with someone who's familiar with survey design, having a conversation with Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT around, "Here are the survey questions. Or can you propose some?" And then make sure you take a couple of rounds. Is this a good survey question? What questions can I answer from the data that I get? What problems could I solve? If you can't answer a question with data, don't get it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
And you have example surveys in your book for folks that want to just copy and paste and not have to think about this much.

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:28):
Yeah, example surveys, a lot of example questions. We even recommend what the format, what the flow should look like, how long it should be, how long it should not be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
One thing that I was reading is that you don't love happiness surveys specifically, asking engineers how happy they are, is that true? If so, why is that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:45):
I don't, no. Well, I'll say I don't love a happiness survey because there are too many things that contribute to happiness. Happiness is a lot, right? So happiness is work, happiness is family, happiness is hobbies, happiness is weekends, happiness... There are so many things that contribute to happiness. Now, that doesn't mean I don't care about happiness. I think happiness surveys are not particularly useful here. What can be helpful is satisfaction and people are like, "That's the same thing." It's not because you can ask, "Are you satisfied with this tool?" and then ask some follow-up questions. Now, those two are related because the more satisfied you are with your job and your tools and the work and your team, it contributes to happiness. I used to joke... Remember the golf commercials like, "Happy cows like happy cheese"?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):
No.

Nicole Forsgren (00:57:35):
I had a Calabrian. That was the best. Happy devs make happy code. They write better programs, they do better work, they're better team members and collaborators. But capturing and trying to directly influence happiness, that's not what we are here for. It's too challenging, it's too all-encompassing. Satisfaction can give us some signal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:59):
In a totally different direction, in terms of just tools you see people using, are there any that just like, "Oh, yeah, this one's really commonly great." For people, this is just a tool people are finding a lot of success with. There's the common ones, Copilot, Cursor. I don't know. Is there anything that stands out that you want to share, just like, "Hey, you should check this tool out. People seem to love it"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:21):
I think they're huge, right? Copilot, Cursor, Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):
Claude Code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:26):
Yep, Claude Code. I love Claude Code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):
I have a whole post coming on ways to use Claude Code for non-engineering use cases.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:35):
Cool. Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
It's so interesting. For example, Claude Code, "Find ways to clean up storage on my laptop," and it just tells you there's a bunch of files. It's just like ChatGPT running on your computer and you could do all kinds of crazy stuff on your computer for you, like a mini God.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:36):
I'm going to do that now. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
It's so good. Yeah, that's why I'm writing this. I had Dan Shipper was on the podcast and he said Claude Code is the most underrated AI tool out there because people don't realize what it's capable of. It's not just for coding, and that's what I'm trying to explore more and more. Okay. Is there anything else that you think would be valuable to help people improve their developer experience, help them adapt to this new world of AI and engineering that we haven't covered?

Nicole Forsgren (00:59:22):
I think something that's important to think about in general is to bring a product mindset to any type of DevEx improvements that are happening, and also the metrics that we collect and capture. By that, I mean we want to identify a problem, make sure we're solving a problem for a set of users. We want to think about creating MVPs and experiments and get fast feedback, do some rapid iteration. We want to have a strategy. We want to know who our addressable market is. We want to know what success is. We want to basically have a go-to-market function. We need to have comms. We need to get continuous feedback from our customers. We want to keep improving. And, at some point, we want to think about sunsetting something. Is it in maintenance mode? Is it sun setting?

(01:00:12):
And I think that's important in general, but I think it's extra important now because when we have AI tools, we're using AI tools, we're embedding AI into our products, things are changing so rapidly that it can be really important to take half a beat and say, "Okay, what's the problem I'm trying to solve right here? Is this metric that we've had for the last 10 years still important or should this be sunset because it's not really important anymore? It's not driving the types of decisions and actions that I need."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Before we get to our exciting lightning round, I want to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. Is there some way that you've found a use for an AI tool in your life, in your work that you think might be fun to share, that you think might be useful to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:00:55):
I have been working on some home design and redecorating rooms and stuff. I'm working with a designer because I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, I'm not good at this. But I've really been loving ChatGPT and Gemini especially to render pictures for me, so I can give it the floor plan, I can give it one shot of the room that's definitely not what it's supposed to look like, and then I can give it pictures of a couple different things, and then I can just tell it change the walls or change the furniture layout or change something. It helps me and it's relatively quick. It helps me kind of visualize the things... Again, I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, so I know if I like it or not, which is probably a very random use, but it's fun for now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
My wife does exactly the same thing. She's sending me constantly, "Here's what this rug will look like in our living room. Here's this water feature." It's so good and it keeps getting better. It's just like, "Wow, that's exactly our house with this new rug," and all you do is just upload these two photos and just like, "Cool. How would this look in our room?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've been impressed a couple times. Definitely the machines are listening to us. It's given me a mock-up of a room or something and then it throws in a dog bed, because I have dogs. I'm like, "I did not tell you to do that, but yeah, that's probably the color and style of dog bed that I should have in this room."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):
Speaking of that, have you tried this use case, ask ChatGPT, "Generate an image of what you think my house looks like based on everything you know about me."

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:22):
I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
Because it has memory and it remembers everything you've talked about, and it's hilarious. You got to do it.

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:29):
Okay, that's on my to-do list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
There we go. Bonus use case. Nicole, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:38):
Awesome. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:43):
Outlive by Peter Attia is fantastic. Another one that's I guess maybe related, I hurt my back so it's not great, Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill is incredible. Shout out to anyone who has hurt lower back. It's for a lay person to read through and figure out how to fix lower back problems. It's kind of a random one. I will say I love How Big Things Get Done. I can't pronounce the names. I think one's... There's Scandinavian, one is. It kind of dissects really large projects through recent-ish history and where they failed and why. And I think it's really interesting for us to think about, especially now in this AI moment where basically all of our at least software systems are going to be changing. So how do we think about approaching what is essentially going to be a very large project? And then, sorry, I'm going to throw in a bonus one, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis. Matt Velloso recommended it to me, and it's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Yes, I read that-

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:44):
I audibly gasped at the last sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
Oh. I was like, "What?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:47):
I was [inaudible 01:03:48]. Yeah, I was not expecting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
I read that and I do not remember that last sentence. Oh, man. Okay, cool. Next question. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you recently watched and enjoyed?

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:57):
I'll say I watch Love Is Blind. If I got to shut down at the end of the day, Love Is Blind is fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):
There's a new season out.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:03):
Yeah, very excited... and Shrinking. Have you seen Shrinking?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
No. I think I started The Therapist and yeah, I gave it a shot.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:12):
Strongly recommend it. It's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
Sweet. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some kitchen gadgets, some clothing.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:21):
Yeah, the Ninja Creami is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Did you say this last time?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:25):
I don't know. I may have. I don't think so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:29):
Somebody said this and I still remember it. It's like-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:30):
It's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
... you make ice cream and stuff with it, right?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:33):
Yeah, and you can basically freeze a protein shake and then it turns it into ice cream-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
Oh, man.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:37):
... which is delicious. Another one is a Jura coffee maker. I'd love good coffee and I'm not great at making it, so I can just push the button and it'll give me anything I want, including lattes, cappuccinos or anything. So that's kind of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
Sweet, okay. Do you have a favorite-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:54):
Just sugar and caffeine. I just need a power through the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
There's the engineering productivity 101.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:01):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):
Oh, man. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or life and come back to in various ways?

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:09):
Yeah, I think one that's come up a couple times, it's not a verbatim thing, I think it's more the vibe, hindsight is 2020, but it's also really dumb. I think if we made the best decision we could at the time with the information that we had available, then it is what it is. If you make a bad decision because you made a bad decision and you knew better, you had the information, not great. I don't think we give ourselves or other people enough grace because we always end up finding more information out later.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Hear, hear. Final question. I was going to ask you something else, but as we are preparing for this, you shared that you have a new role at Google. Maybe just talk about that, what you're up to there, why you joined Google, anything folks should know.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:53):
Sure. I am senior director of developer intelligence and core developer. It's super exciting and super fun because of all of these things we've been talking about. It's focused on Google and all their properties and their underlying infrastructure, how can we improve developer experience, developer productivity, velocity, all of these things we've been talking about and, because kind of the numbers person, how do we want to think about measuring it, how does measurement change, how do feedback loops change, how can we improve the experience throughout and then kind of drive that change through an organization in ways that are meaningful and impactful and faster than they've been before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:33):
Nice job, Google, getting Nicole. What a win. I need to get some more Google stock ASAP. Okay, two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online and find your book online if they want to dig deeper? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Nicole Forsgren (01:06:47):
Online, you can find the book at developerexperiencebook.com, I'm at nicolefv.com, and LinkedIn occasionally. Sometimes it's a mess. I try to wade through all of the noise. I get there to be useful, sign up for the book and the workbooks. The workbooks are free. I'd love to get any kind of feedback on what works, what doesn't. I always love hearing those kind of stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
Nicole, thank you so much for being here.

Nicole Forsgren (01:07:17):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

# How to measure AI developer productivity in 2025 | Nicole Forsgren

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:03):
Most productivity metrics are a lie. If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever. It's just too easy to gain that system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
How do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can?

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:18):
Most teams can move faster. But faster for what? We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
One of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is learning how much to trust code that it generates.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:32):
We can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it. Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
So much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:00:45):
There's some real opportunity there to not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work. Now, we can also make a 45-minute work block useful because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by, reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:01:09):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today, my guest is Nicole Forsgren. With so much talk about how AI is increasing developer productivity, more and more people are asking, "How do we measure this productivity gain? And are these AI tools actually helping us or hurting how our developers work?" Nicole has been at the forefront of this space longer than anyone. She created the most used frameworks for measuring developer experience called DORA and SPACE. She wrote the most important book in the space called Accelerate and is about to publish her newest book called Frictionless, which gives you a guide to helping your team move faster and do more in this emerging AI world. Her core thesis is that AI indeed accelerates coding. But developers aren't speeding up as much as you think because they still have to deal with broken builds and unreliable tools and processes, and a bunch of new bottlenecks that are emerging.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we chat about her current, best and very specific advice for how to measure productivity gains from AI, signs that your team could be moving faster, what companies get wrong when trying to measure engineering productivity, how AI tools are both helping and hurting engineers, including getting into flow states, her seven-step process for setting up a developer experience team at your company, how to get buy-in and measure the impact of a team like this and a ton more. This episode is for anyone looking to improve the performance of their engineering teams.

Nicole, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:16):
Thank you. It's so good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
It's so good to have you back. I was just watching our first episode, which we did two and a half years ago. I was watching it, and I was both shocked and not shocked that we barely talked about AI. The episode was called How to Measure and Improve Developer Productivity, and we got to AI barely like an hour in and we're just like, "Hmm, I wonder what's going to happen with AI and productivity." Does that just blow your mind?

Nicole Forsgren (00:05:41):
Yeah. Because it was just hitting the scene, it was the topic of so much conversation, and at the same time, so many things don't change. So many things are still important, so many things are the same. Yeah. It's also a little wild that it's been two and a half. Where does time go? Time is a social construct?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:01):
Yeah. Most of our conversation was just questions like, "Well, how might this impact people? How will we change the way we build product?" It was barely a thing back then. Now, it's the only thing that I imagine people want to talk about when they talk about engineering productivity. That's where we're going to be spending a lot of our time focusing on today. The reason I'm excited about this conversation, it feels like there's been so much money poured into AI tools increasing productivity. The fastest growing companies in the world are these engineering AI tools. And now, more and more people are just asking this question of just, "What gains are we getting out of this? How much is this actually helping us be more productive? How do we become more productive?"

(00:06:39):
You've been at the center of this world for longer than anyone. You've invented so many of the frameworks that people rely on now. So I'm really excited to have you back to talk about this stuff. I want to start with just this term DevEx, it's something that comes up a lot in this whole space, and we're going to hear this term a bunch in this conversation. Can you just explain what is DevEx, this term DevEx?

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:00):
DevEx is developer experience. And when we think about developer experience, we're really talking about what it's like to build software, day to day, for a developer. So the friction that they face, the workflows that they have to go through, any support that they have. It's important because when DevEx is poor, everything else just isn't going to help. The best processes, the best tools, the best... whatever magic you have, if the DevEx is bad, everything kind of takes-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):
Within DevEx is productivity, and I think the key insight that you had and other folks in the space of that is not just productivity, but there's also engineering happiness. We're going to get into a lot of these parts, but just maybe speak to... there's productivity and there's broader components to engineers being successful at a company.

Nicole Forsgren (00:07:51):
Yeah. I love that point because productivity, first of all, is hard to define anyway. But if you're just looking at output, you can get there in a lot of different ways. But if you're getting there in ways that are high toil or high friction, then at some point, a developer is going to burn out. Or if it's super high cognitive load, if it's hard to even think about what you're doing because concentrating on the mechanics of... the plumbing of something, then you don't have the brain space left to come up with really innovative solutions and questions. So I love that it's kind of this self-reinforcing loop in terms of, "You do more work, you do better work." And it's better for people, it's better for the systems, it's better for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:34):
I was going to get to this later, but I want to actually get to this right now, this idea of flow state for engineers. I was an engineer, actually, early in my career. I went to a school for computer science. I was an engineer for 10 years. The best part of the job for me was just this flow state you enter when you're coding and building, and just things feel like so fun. It feels like AI is making that harder in a lot of ways because there's all these agents you're working with now, there's all this code that's kind of being written for you. Talk about just the importance of flow state to a developer, happiness, developer productivity, and just what you've seen AI impacting. How you've seen AI impacting that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:09:07):
Well, there are lots of different ways to talk about DevEx. One way to talk about it is kind of three key things that have components that are important of themselves, and they also kind of reinforce each other. Flow state is one of them, cognitive load is another, and then feedback loops are another. I think when you touch on this... Your question about flow state is a really good one, and I'll admit we're just a few years into this. We're still figuring out what the best flow state and cognitive requirements are for people in this because, to your point, sometimes we're getting interrupted all the time. You don't just get in the flow and lock down, and write a whole bunch of code and do the typing of a whole bunch of code as much anymore. Instead, you're kind of creating a prompt, getting some code back and reviewing the code, trying to integrate what's happening in the system, and that can really interrupt.

(00:10:02):
At the same time though, it can contribute to flow if... I've seen some senior engineers pull together some tool chains that are really incredible, where they figured out how to keep the flow going. The fast feedback loops really, really work well for them. They can kind of assign out different pieces to agents. It helps them keep in the flow in terms of... Instead of details and line-by-line writing, they're in the flow in terms of, "What's my goal? What are the pieces that I need to get there? How quickly can I get there? So then, I can step back and kind of evaluate everything, and then dive back in and fix some pieces."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Is there anything more you could say about this engineer that figured out this really cool workflow, about just what that looks like?

Nicole Forsgren (00:10:39):
I've spoken with a handful of them, and I've kind of watched them work. I haven't built it myself yet. It's on my list. They've been able to set up this really incredible workspace and workflow where... Right now, a lot of us play around with tools and... We'll put in a prompt and we'll get a few lines back or maybe we'll put in a prompt and we'll get whole programs back. Well, what they can do is they can... Many times I'll see them say, to help prime it, "This is what I want to build. It needs to have these basic architectural components. It needs to have this kind of a stack. It needs to follow this general workflow. Help me think that through," and it'll kind of design it for it. And then for each piece, it'll assign an agent to go work on each pace in parallel, and then it'll say and upfront, "These need to be able to work together, make sure it's architected correctly. Make sure we use appropriate APIs and conventions."

(00:11:30):
Then at the end, they can let it run for a few minutes. They can think through something else that's interesting or they anticipate is going to be hairy, and they come back to something that's probably a little better than vibe coded. Because they were so systematic about it upfront, they're much closer to something that looks like production code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:51):
So what I'm hearing is spending a little time upfront planning, what all these AI engineers are doing, versus just powering through and just figuring out as you go.

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
Okay, cool. Let me get to this quite a core question that I think on is a lot of people's minds. A lot of companies are trying to measure productivity for their teams, "Is this improving our productivity? Is this hurting our productivity?" So let me just start with this question, how are people doing this wrong currently when they try to measure their productivity gains with AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:23):
I'll say most productivity metrics are a lie. It's really tricky because, historically... Now, look, lines of code has always been a bad metric, but many folks still use lines of code-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):
[inaudible 00:12:37].

Nicole Forsgren (00:12:37):
... yeah, as some proxy as some proxy for output or productivity or complexity or something. Well, now, for many of the systems, that they would sometimes whisper and not super talk about that uses lines of code, it's just blown out of the water because, "What do you mean by lines of code?" If the goal is more lines of code, I can prompt something to write the longest piece of code ever and add tons of comments. We know that agents and LLMs tend to be very verbose by definition, and so it's just too easy to gain that system and then introduce complexity and technical debt into all of the work that you're doing. I will say there are some things that we can kind of watch and pay attention to because... So lines of code as a productivity metric isn't great, it's pretty bad. But now, it's kind of more relevant if we can tease out which code came from people and which code came from AI because now we can answer downstream questions.

(00:13:40):
"What is the code survivability rate? What is the quality of our code? Is our code being fed back into trained systems? And for that code that's retraining systems later, especially if we're doing fine-tuning and local tuning, how much of that is machine generated? What types of loops is that creating, and what types of patterns or biases might it be inadvertently introducing?" On the one hand, it's not good as a productivity metric, but it can be useful. I'll even say the same for DORA. I have done DORA metrics, their speed metrics, their stability metrics. If that's all you're looking at, it's not going to be sufficient anymore because AI has now changed the way we think about feedback loops. They need to be much faster. Now, what DORA's meant for, kind of assessing the pipeline overall in terms of speed and stability. Still, that works. But we can't just blindly apply the existing metrics we've used before because we'll miss super important phenomenon and changes in the way people work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:38):
Interesting. You invented DORA, that was kind of the main framework people used for a long time to measure productivity. And then there's SPACE, there's Core 4, there's probably others. So what I'm hearing here is all these are kind of out of date now, where AI is contributing large portions of code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:14:55):
I will say if it is a prescriptive metric, it needs to be used only in the way it was prescribed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:00):
So

Nicole Forsgren (00:15:01):
DORA 4, there are four key metrics. There's two speed metrics, deployment frequency and lead time. So code commit to code deploy. There's stability metrics, MTTR and change fail rate. If those are used to assess the speed of the pipeline and the general performance of the pipeline, that's great. If you're trying to use those to understand... Because implied in that is feedback loops, right, because you used to kind of get feedback from customers. But we can't just use that blindly now when we're using AI, as an example, because we have feedback loops much earlier and not even just at the local build and test phase. We have feedback loops throughout, and even sometimes in the middle of some of the pipeline, that we really want to leverage in ways that weren't as useful before. I won't say they weren't possible, but we just didn't really focus there.

(00:15:53):
So those are prescriptive metrics. When we think about SPACE, SPACE is a framework. It doesn't tell you what metric to use. So I'll say, sometimes people get real frustrated because I didn't tell them what to measure. But now, I think that's the power of it. We're actually seeing that SPACE applies fairly well in these new emerging contexts like AI because we still want to look at... SPACE is an acronym. We still want to look at satisfaction. We still want to look at performance, what's the outcome. We still want to look at activity. Yes, in some ways, lines of code and number of PRs can be useful for something, or number of alerts or number of things, activities or counts. Seize communication and collaboration, this is also super important and useful because it's how our systems communicate with each other, and also how our people do. "What proportion of work is being offloaded to a chat bot versus talking to a senior engineer on the team?" More isn't always better and less isn't always better, it depends.

(00:16:50):
And then efficiency and flow, "Can people get in the flow? How much time does it take to do things? What is the flow like through our system?" Here, I would probably add a couple of dimensions. So chatting with some of the early authors to say trust. Not to say trust wasn't important before, but now it's very, very front of mind. Right? Before you build your code, if the compile comes back, you're fine. And that's the way it is. LLMs are non-deterministic. Right now, we can't just put in a command and guess something back and accept it. We really need to evaluate it, so, "Are we seeing hallucinations? What's the reliability? Does it meet the style that we would typically write? And if it doesn't meet, is that fine?" So it depends on... Prescriptive. You got to make sure you're using it fit for purpose. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
We're going to get to your current thinking on the best way to do this stuff. You have a book coming out that explains how to do this well, so we're going to get to that. One thing I wanted to highlight in our last chat that we had, you highlighted that one of the biggest issues we're going to probably have with AI is trust, understanding and learning how much to trust the code that it generates, and also how much... you said this, two and a half years ago, that so much of the time is now going to be spent reviewing code versus writing code. That's exactly what I'm hearing.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:10):
I think it'll be interesting to see how that impacts the way we structure work moving forward. We were talking about flow state and cognitive load. Now that our attention has to focus on things at certain times and it's broken up from how we used to do it, I think there's some real opportunity there to, not just rethink workflows, but rethink how we structure our days and how we structure our work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:31):
Can you say more about that? Just what is that? What are you thinking will be happening? Where do you think things go? What are you seeing working?

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:37):
This is purely speculative. But for example, Gloria Mark has done some really good work on attention and deep work, and humans can get about four hours of good deep work a day. That's about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:52):
Yeah,. I feel that.

Nicole Forsgren (00:18:54):
That's kind of the upper limit-ish for the most part, and I'm sure people are going to be like, "Well, I am superhuman and I can do-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
What if you take 20 grams of creatine?

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:01):
Right. What if we microdose?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:02):
Yeah, exact;y.

Nicole Forsgren (00:19:06):
Yeah. So in the context of knowing we have about four hours of good deep work... I'm sure many of us have probably hit this, right? We have good periods. Maybe it's morning, maybe it's afternoon for folks. And then you hit a time where you're like, "I'm going to clean up my inbox because that is all I can do right now. I can be functional, but I'm not going to come up with my best innovative, problem solving, authoring, code writing work." A lot of times, the way to do that and to get into it is to have these long chunks to get into flow and to get that deep work. Usually, I'm [inaudible 00:19:43] two hours-ish. An hour can be tricky because it could take time to get into that state. Okay. Well, when we think about what it used to be like, back in the old days, three years ago, three and a half years ago, we could block off four hours of time and we could probably get two or three hours of really good work done. Because we were just focused, right? There were no interruptions, minimal interruptions.

(00:20:05):
Now, the nature of writing code and systems itself is interrupt driven or full of interruptions, at least, because you start something and then it interjects. So how do we think about that? Does that mean that a four-hour word block is still useful? Probably. But does that mean that now we can also make a 45-minute work block useful? Because getting into the flow is actually kind of handed off, at least, in part to the machine or the machine can help us get back into the flow by reminding us of context and generating diagrams of the system and all the things. So I think that's a really, really interesting area that's just ripe for questions and opportunity. And please, folks, do this research and come back to me because... It might not make my list, but it's such a great question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
That is so interesting. Essentially, every engineer is turning into an EM, engineering manager, coordinating all of these junior AI engineers. So your point is even if you have a 30-hour block, you can get deep into code, but you can unblock all these AI engineers that are running off doing tasks. Plus, your point is they remind you of just like, "Here's where you left off. Okay. You can just jump into this code, maybe make some tweaks."

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:18):
So interesting. Let me zoom out a little bit and... Before we get into your framework for how to approach developer experience, the latest thinking you've got, beyond just obviously engineers doing more is great, what's your best pitch for why companies should really, really focus on developer experience?

Nicole Forsgren (00:21:37):
I hate to say return of investment, but the business value is... the opportunity here is huge. In general, we write software for fun and for hobbies, but we also have software because it meets a business need. It helps us with market share, it helps us attract and retain customers, it helps us do all of these things. And I think DevEx is important because it enables all of that software creation, it enables all of that problem solving. It enables the super rapid experimentation with customers that... Before, you'd need a while for a prototype and maybe a little bit longer to actually flight it through an A/B test on a production system. You can do it in hours, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:21):
Maybe the opposite end of the spectrum, getting very tactical, before we get into the larger framework, what's just one thing that you think an eng team, a product team can do this week, next week to help their developer experience maybe get more done?

Nicole Forsgren (00:22:35):
Honestly, I think the best thing you can do is go talk to people and listen. I love that the audience of this podcast is primarily PMs because they tend to be really good at this. And I would say start with listening and not with tools and automation. So many times companies are like, "Well, I'm just going to build this tool," or, "I'm going to build this thing." Often you build a thing that you yourself have had a challenge with or that is easy to do, easy to automate. And if you just go talk to people and ask the developers like, "Think of yesterday, what did you do yesterday? Walk me through it. What were the points that were just delightful? What were the points that were really difficult? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you get slowed down? Where was there friction?" If you go talk to a handful of people, a lot of times, you can surface a handful of things that are relatively low lift and still have impact or you can identify a process that's unnecessarily complex and slow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:36):
So the listening to, I hear, almost is you want to help your teams move faster and be happier eng teams. Your advice is just, "Before you do anything, just go ask them what is bothering you."

Nicole Forsgren (00:23:46):
Go ask them, yeah. And trust me, most developers are going to be more than happy to tell you what's broken and what's bad. I'll say, there was one company that I had worked with. I remember they had a process that was really difficult and it was on an old mainframe system, and they were going to have to replat the whole thing and so they never went to work on it or talk about it. Everyone hated it because it was this huge delay. I mean, all they had to do was change a process. Sometimes all you have to do is change a process. And they changed it so that instead of... I think someone had to print it out and walk it down three or four flights, and they get approval. And then someone else had to walk it back up, and so it was just that interim. They didn't replat anything. They didn't redesign anything major. They just sent an email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:31):
Let me push on that and... I'm curious just what are the most common things people do. If you're just starting on, "Okay, we need to focus on engineering experience," what do you find are the most... two or three most common improvements companies need to make?

Nicole Forsgren (00:24:45):
I'll say, I'll kind of echo that process, there's almost always a process that can be improved and that can be improved without a lot of engineering lift or a lot of engineering headcount. Most large companies, in particular, have something that is several, several steps. It's the way it is because it's the way it is, but that's no longer the way it is. And even small companies sometimes is just a little too YOLO, and you don't know what it is and you're kind of chasing everyone around. So if you can create a very lightweight process, that can also be helpful. That can be one of the best places to start, especially if you have limited exposure to the whole rest of the org. Sometimes just a team process can help.

(00:25:28):
I will say from a business leader's standpoint, a lot of what you can do is provide structure and support for this organizational change. Communicate what you're doing, communicate what the priorities are, communicate why this is important, to celebrate wins. Because if folks try to do this, just like a one-off side fully-isolated project, it's really challenging to get some good momentum, to get people to care, and to get them stay involved. Because it feels like it's just another internal project that isn't going to matter or that isn't going to get celebrated, but it has these huge upside potential returns for the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):
It's interesting, what I'm hearing here is nothing about tools or technologies. It's not like move to this cloud, it's not like install this new deployment system, it's processes and people and org and morale.

Nicole Forsgren (00:26:24):
Yeah. Now, there will be technical pieces that are very important, especially now with AI, where we're rethinking how build and test systems work. We're rethinking feedback to users so that it's very, very customized in terms of what is shared and when it is shared. There are a lot of technical pieces that are involved, but that's not the only thing. It's necessary but not sufficient, and that doesn't have to be the place that you start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
I have a hard question I want to ask you that I thought of as you were talking. I feel like this is the question that most founders and heads think about. And the question is just like, how do I know if my eng team is moving fast enough, if they can move faster, if they're just not performing as well as they can? What are just maybe smells, signs that tell you, "Yeah, my team should be moving faster," versus, "This is just the way it works. This is as fast as they can move"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:27:16):
Most teams can move faster, right? Also, given what we know about cognitive load, not all speed gains are necessarily good. Or the upside is going to be kind of limited once you hit kind of a certain point, and most people are not even near that point. I don't know a single team, frankly. But how do you know? You know if you're always hearing about bills breaking, flaky tests, overly long processes, if you have to request a new system or if you need to provision a new environment, or if it's really, really hard to switch tasks or switch projects. So if someone has an opportunity to go work in another part of an org and they don't for reasons that are unclear, and not political, and anyone says anything about the system, that's usually a pretty good smell that there's friction somewhere.

(00:28:20):
Because once you finally figure out your system and you're able to get work done, the switching costs can often be really, really high to go anywhere else. So sometimes people will do that. But I've worked with companies where switching orgs within the company, you had to basically pay the same tax as a new hire because the systems were so different and they were so full of friction, and it was so difficult to do so many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I love the first part of your answer especially, which is you can always move faster. I think every founder is going to love hearing that. To your point though, there's diminishing returns over time?

Nicole Forsgren (00:28:58):
Yeah. And you don't know about the quality, right? So I think that's the other side is that you can always move faster, but faster for what? Are we making the right business decisions? And I think that's especially where PMs come in. We can ship trash faster every single day. We need strategy and really smart decisions to know what to ship, what to experiment with, what features we want to do in what order and what rollout. The strategy is the core piece, and then think about speeding that up. If we don't have the other pieces in place, I mean, garbage in, garbage out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
I want to follow that thread, but before I do that, just to mirror back what you shared. So signs that your team... There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to improve the productivity of your team as builds are always breaking. There's flaky tests are constantly incorrect, false positives. It's hard to context switch between different projects. You just hear people talking about the system, it's just really hard to work with. Is that roughly right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:29:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Cool, okay. So going back to the point you just made, there's a sense that AI is making teams so much faster because it's writing all this code for them. You're going to have all these asynchronous agents, engineers working for you. It feels like a core part of your message is that's just a one part of engineering work and there's so much more, including figuring out what to build... an alignment internally. Maybe just speak to just... There is a lot of opportunity to improve engineering performance productivity, but there's so many other elements that are not improved through AI?

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:22):
Yes. Or could be in the future, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Mm-hmm.

Nicole Forsgren (00:30:26):
I think there are a lot of ways that we can pull in AI tools to help us refine our strategy, refine our message, think about the experimentation methods or targets of experimentation, or think about our total addressable market, but we need to have that strategy and plan fairly well aligned or at least have two or three alternatives that you want to test. Because now, the engineering can go, or at least the prototyping especially, much, much faster. We can throw out prototypes. We can run any tests and experiments that are customer facing, assuming that we have the infrastructure in place, which allows us to learn and progress much faster before. In some places, it used to take months to get something through production to do A/B testing and get feedback. We can do this in a day or two, definitely under a week. But we want to make sure that we're building and testing the right things, "Are we partnering with the right... Do we have the data that we need?"

(00:31:24):
And I will say AI can actually be a pretty good partner there if you have a good conversation with it, and then also check with you experts, "What type of data should I be looking at? What type of instrumentation do I need? What type of analysis can I do?" Because then, you can also go to your data science team and say, "I'm planning on doing this. I'd like to..." Let's not just YOLO A/B tests because that can be... It's a shame to do a large test and end up disrupting users or disrupting customers, or breaking privacy or security protocols and also end up with data that's unusable because you just can't get the signal that you're looking for. But now, I'm also seeing people kind of accelerate that into a few days versus a few weeks. So they can start those key stakeholder discussions from a much more informed kind of filled out space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy-to-organize tab.

(00:33:04):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time. To try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A-dot-I-O-slash-Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.

(00:33:33):
I love that you work with a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different types of businesses. I think very few people get to see inside a lot of different places. What kind of gains are you just seeing in terms of increased productivity with AI? How big of a gain have you seen?

Nicole Forsgren (00:33:49):
I'd say it's real, and I would also say we don't have great measures for it yet. We're still trying to figure out what to measure and what that looks like. One of the best is going to be velocity, all the way through the system, how quickly can you get a feature or a product or something through the system so that you can then experiment a test, either from idea to final end or even kind of a feature and a piece through the system so we can test. That's really good. Now, that's also hard to tie back directly to a particular AI tool in the hands of a particular developer. But there are some other things that we can look at and we can see, and that I've seen is, again, this kind of rapid prototyping.

(00:34:36):
I hate lines of code, but I'm going to use the lines of code. We do see... I know I worked with some folks who had kind of a whole set of companies they were looking at, and they found that AI was generating significantly more code for the people who were using it regularly. But then, they also found that for folks who were regular users of AI coding environments, AI ADEs, the tool kind of gave them more code. And then the engineers themselves, the increase was double what the coding agent had given them. So one, I'd say, probably it's kind of a secondary or knock on or just a smell is it can unblock you. It can speed up the work that you would already do. I know sometimes when I work, the first few minutes, it's hard for me to start. But once I get started, I'm there. So they're really good at unblocking and unlocking that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):
Something I've seen people on Twitter sharing is how good OpenAI Codex, especially, is at finding really gnarly bugs. And I think it was Karpathy that shared it. He was so stuck on a bug and, no AI tool could figure it out. And then the latest version of Codex spent an hour or something, looking into it, and found it for him.

Nicole Forsgren (00:35:51):
Yeah. I'm hearing incredible things like that, right? Well, and even also writing unit tests and spinning up unit tests, and creating documentation and cleaning up documentation because I know now people are like, "Oh. Well, we have agents. I don't need to read the docs because there's the code there." It turns out, agents rely on good data because it's all about how they've been trained or how they've been grounded. And better data gives you better outcomes, and some of that data includes documentation and comments. The better documentation and the better comments you have, the better performance you're going to get out of your AI tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):
And AI can help you write that documentation. I've been working with Devin a little bit, and it's really good at that stuff.

Nicole Forsgren (00:36:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
Okay. Let's talk about this framework, this book. So you're publishing a book called Frictionless, which sounds like a dream, "How do you create a dev team that's frictionless?" It's called Frictionless: 7 Steps to Remove Barriers, Unlock Value, and Outpace Your Competition in the Age of AI. There's a seven-step process to this. Walk us through this and maybe give us just context on this book, who it's meant for, what problem it solves, and then the seven steps.

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:00):
I will say, I also wrote this with Abi Noda who has just... of DX. He has incredible experience in the space. He's worked with hundreds of companies and so it was kind of nice bouncing ideas off of him. Also, thanks to all of the engineering leads and DevEx leads, and CTOs, and engineers that we talked to to make sure that our smells were right. So who is this book for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
Let me take a tangent on Abi, and DX, since you mentioned him. This is super interesting, and I think it connects so directly with this conversation. Abi started this company called DX, which is such a great name for a company around developer experience. They just sold the company for a billion dollars to Atlassian. It's a very high multiple on their ARR. It, to me, shows exactly why this conversation is so valuable, just how much value companies are putting into improving developer experience. Atlassian would spend a billion dollars on this. It's an early stage-ish startup. It was doing really well and people loved it, but it was like early stage-ish, a billion dollars. And the idea is they have all these companies working using Jira and all their products. They're all trying to figure out how do we measure productivity. It's worth a lot of money to them. And I know you were an early advisor to them too, so-

Nicole Forsgren (00:37:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):
... it just shows us how important this is.

Nicole Forsgren (00:38:17):
Yeah. Well, I think it also shows us how much value you can get out of this. There's so much low-hanging fruit, there's so much unlocked potential, and it's hard to know where to start a lot of times even in... I've been at large companies that have a lot of expertise and a lot of really, really smart people. But if you haven't kind of been in this space and thinking about it this way, it's hard to know where to start or it's easy to make simple mistakes up front that mean you kind of need to start over later. So I guess it also brings us back to, "Who is this book for?" It's for anyone that cares about DevEx, so definitely technology leaders, anyone who's trying to kick off a DevEx program, or is working on a DevEx DevEx improvement program. I think it's particularly relevant for PMs because if you're PMing something that involves software building and creating software, improving DevEx will only help your team. And also, you have key skills and insights and instincts that are so important to DevEx that many times, I will say, I've seen engineering teams just miss.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Okay. What's the framework? What are the steps? Where do people start?

Nicole Forsgren (00:39:35):
The book goes through a seven-step process, and then also kind of provides some key kind of principles at the end. Step one is to start the journey. So assuming you're kicking off, you can start the journey. And this involves what we have already talked about. Go talk to people, have a listening tour, synthesize what you learn, visualize the workflow and tools, get a handle on what the current state is. Step two is to get a quick win. So start small, get a quick win, pick the right projects, share out what you've done. Step three is using data to optimize the work. So establish some of your data foundation, find the data that's there, start collecting new data, use some surveys for some really fast insights and may include example surveys. Step four then is to decide strategy and priority. Once you have some data, then you need to know of all the things that are potentially broken. And if you've already gotten your quick win of all the things that are left, "What should I do next?" So we walk through some evaluation frameworks there.

(00:40:43):
Step five is to sell your strategy. Once you've decided, now you have to kind of convince everyone else. So now you want to get feedback, you want to share why this is the right strategy right now. Step six is to drive change at your scale. So here, we address folks that have local scope of control. If you're starting on just a dev team, you want to do it yourself, kind of grassroots effort or global scope of control. If you're the VP of developer experience or something, there are some things that you can leverage for a top down, and then how do you drive change when you're kind of somewhere in the middle, because you can leverage both types of strategies. And then step seven is to evaluate your progress and show value, and then kind of loop back around.

(00:41:27):
I will say that we wrote this so that you could kind of jump into any step wherever you are right now. If you're kicking off a team or an initiative, you'll probably want to start at step one. You should definitely start at step one. If you're joining an existing initiative, you could jump into picking the priority or implementing the changes. So those are the seven steps. There's a seven steps, there are a few practices that we also recommend. So thinking about resourcing it, change management, making technology sustainable, and then also bringing a PM lens to this, "How can we think about developer experience as a product, and how do we think about the metrics that we have as a product?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):
Awesome, okay. I have questions. Point people to the book real quick. What's the URL? How do they get it? When does it come out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:18):
Yeah, developerexperiencebook.com. Right now, you can sign up for the mailing list. We'll let you know when it's out on pre-order, and we'll also be sharing pieces of the workbook. So we've got almost a hundred page workbook that goes along with the book, and then it should be out by end of year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
Okay. So one piece of this is just this term developer experience feels very intentional in that it's not developer productivity, developer work. It's how do we make developer experiences better at our company, which includes they get more done, but also they're happier and things like that. So I think that's an important element of this, right?

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):
Okay.

Nicole Forsgren (00:42:56):
Because, again, it's not just about productivity. We talked about this from the frame and the lens of, "We need to be building the right thing." And you want to be productive, but you also want to be thinking about... and this is what engineers are also just really incredibly good at, give them a problem and don't tell them how to solve it, and then they can solve it better. They have the freedom, they have the innovation, they have the creativity so that they can solve this problem. If it's only about productivity, then it's just lines of code or number PRs or whatever. But we really want to talk about value and how do we unlock value, and how do we get value faster. And that involves, yes, making them more productive and removing friction because then, they have the flow and the cognitive load and the things that we kind of talked about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:41):
Awesome, okay. And then say someone wants to start this team, what does it usually look like. At Airbnb, I remember this team forming. It was just like an engineer or two, getting it started and taking charge. What do you recommend as the pilot team, and then what does it look like as it grows?

Nicole Forsgren (00:43:57):
There are a few ways to do this, right? So if you're doing it yourself, you could do it with a couple of engineers, maybe a PM or a PGM or a TPM to kind of help communicate. Because really, comms plans are just so important here. On a small scale, what we want to do is look for those quick wins, look for things that you can do at small scale. Some folks call them things like paper cuts. There small things that you can do to help people see the value and feel the benefit themselves, "How can a developer's work get better? How can their day-to-day work get better? Kind of build momentum from there?" If you're working from a top-down structure and you have the remit, you still want some quick wins, but those quick wins can look a little more global in scale because you have the infrastructure or the backing to make different types of changes that aren't only local.

(00:44:56):
So an example of a small local change could be just cleaning up your tests, your test suites. Any team could do that, any team could do that. At more global scale, it might be changing organization-wide process that is just overly cumbersome or throwing some resourcing into cleaning up the provisioning environment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Okay. What kind of impact have you seen from teams like this forming, on the engineering teams at their companies?

Nicole Forsgren (00:45:21):
I'll say I've seen a huge impact for smaller companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars for large companies or in the billions. Well, also, we need to learn how to communicate that, "What does the math look like?" Many times, we can look at saving time, we can look at saving costs, we can look at a lot of different things. We can look at speed to value as speed to market. We can look at risk reduction, but the gains really are there. I will mention that it tends to follow something like the J-curve. So you'll have a couple of quick wins and it'll look like a big win, and then you'll hit kind of a little divot where suddenly the really obvious projects, the low-hanging fruit are handled. So now, we need to do a little bit of work. We might need to build out a little bit more infrastructure. We might need to build out a little more telemetry, so that we can capture the things we want to capture. And then once we get that done, then we start to see those benefits really compound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:16):
So going back to that measurement number, what do you recommend? How do people find these numbers? Because I think that's so much of the power of this is like, "We saved a million dollars doing this." What do you look at to figure that out?

Nicole Forsgren (00:46:28):
I think there are a few different things to keep in mind, like who is our key audience, and we usually have a few key audiences. We really want to be able to speak to developers because they're the ones that are going to be using the systems. They'll be partnering with you on either building them or at least providing feedback about what you're doing. So for them, we often want to frame this in terms of things they care about. So time savings. If something gets faster, they can save time. They don't spend time doing setup when they don't need to anymore, related to status reduced toil. So compliance and security are super important. Also, many times it requires several manual steps that... I don't say they're not value add. They're not value add from an individual human perspective. If we can automate as much as possible, that's great, and improved focus time.

(00:47:22):
That's from the developer side of you. Leadership often cares about... They care about those things, but they often care more about other things. So we could talk about usually costs in dollars, "Can we accelerate revenue? What does our time to value look like? What is our velocity? How quickly can we get feedback from customers?" And for folks and organizations that are in really competitive environments, that can be really compelling because it's all about speed. We could talk about saving money. Here, we can look at maybe quantifying savings. One example is test and build. If we can clean up a test and build suite to a developer, they really want to hear about time saved and more reliable systems. There's less toil because they don't have to keep re-running tests or kind of go clean up test suites.

(00:48:13):
From the business perspective, cleaning up a test in a build suite can be cloud cost savings because all of those tests are running somewhere on a cloud. And if they always fail or if it's just kind of a waste of spend, that can be useful, recovering some capacity. We can always talk about time and productivity gains, "How much equivalent developer time are we losing on things that are not necessarily value add?" And then sometimes we can correlate to business outcomes and correlate is usually the best we can do here, but there can be some pretty compelling correlations in terms of speeding up time to value and increase market share, for example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:54):
Let me follow that thread and come back to this, what I think is the biggest question people have right now with AI and productivity, and I don't think anyone has the answer yet, but I'm curious to get your take of just what should people do today? What's the best approach to understanding what impact AI tools are having on their productivity? Because they're spending all this money on there. I don't know, what are we getting out of this? So I guess things are moving faster, but I don't know. So if someone had to just like, "Okay, here's what I should probably try to do," what would be your best advice here for measuring the impact of AI tools on productivity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:49:28):
I would say it depends. In part, it depends on what your leadership chain really cares about. We are usually pretty good at figuring out what matters to developers and we could communicate that to them. But if we're trying to just identify two or three data points to really kind of focus on, because when we're first starting with data, sometimes it can be challenging, what do they care about? Think about the messaging you've been hearing. Have they been talking about market share? Losing market share or competitiveness in the marketplace, if that's it, focus on speed. Think about ways that you can capture metrics for speed from feature to production or feature to customer or feature to experiment and what that feedback loop looks like if they're talking about profit margin all the time.

(00:50:18):
Now, we always talk about money because this is business. But if that seems to be an overarching narrative, look for ways that you can save money and then translate that into recovered and recouped headcount cost. Or sometimes you'll reinvent, change a process, and then you no longer need as many vendors. So reductions in vendor spent can also help there. I say also it depends because sometimes they'll say something, leadership will say something, and it kind of comes up as a theme. If you could solve a problem that they have or it's something that they're focused on, if you can slightly reframe it even, like if they're calling everything developer productivity, go ahead and call it productivity. If they're calling it velocity, and velocity is what matters to them, think about how to frame this in terms of velocity. If they're talking about transformation or disruption, how does this help with the disruption? Because then, it will resonate with them. We don't want to make them work to understand what it is that we're doing and the value that we provide.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
That is such good advice. Just to reflect back, the advice here is if your company's trying to figure out what sort of impact are AI tools having on our company, first, it's just like, what does the company care about most? What do leaders care about most? Could be market share, could be profit margin, could be velocity. We need higher velocity or we need to transform, transformation. So your advice there is figure that out based on words and phrases you're hearing. Then figure out ways to measure that, ways to measure market share growing, profit margin increasing. I love these examples, like time from feature, idea to production or to experiment, so maybe start tracking that. If it's margin, it's money saved by fewer tests, failing or some vendor you don't have to pay for, things like that. And then velocity, I imagine that's where things like DORA come in of just speed of engineering, shipping, or... What would you think about there for velocity?

Nicole Forsgren (00:52:16):
I would say it's actually one of those... I would pick as broad a swathe as you can. So if you can go from idea to customer or idea to experiment, how long does that take? How long does it typically take, and how long can it take, and does it take now with improved use of AI tooling and reduction in friction? That's where I will say, we talk about this a little bit in the book, how do we deal with attribution challenges? What was responsible for this? Was it the DevEx or was it AI? Go ahead and disclose that. Say, "Yes, we rolled out AI tools. We also had this effort in DevEx. They partnered very closely together." Both of them probably contributed to this, right? If we had AI tools without the DevEx improvements, we probably would've had some improvements, but not nearly as much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:00):
If people were starting to do this today, say they're just like, "I want to start measuring developer experience," are there a two or three metrics everybody basically needs they should just start measuring ASAP?

Nicole Forsgren (00:53:10):
If you're just starting today and if you have nothing at all, talk to people, obviously. After that, I would do surveys because surveys can give you a nice overall view of the landscape quickly so that you know where the big kind of challenges are. I say that because if you're just starting, you might not have instrumentation through your system, all the metrics. And if you do already, it might not be what you think you want. Metrics that were designed without purpose, questionable. Metrics that were designed for another purpose, they might work for what you want, but they might not, so we can't just assume we have them. That's one reason I like surveys, and we include an example in the book. You can just ask a few questions, "How satisfied are you? What are the biggest barriers to your productivity, or what are the biggest challenges to getting work done?" and let them pick either from a set of tools or maybe a set of processes and then say... Let them pick three, just three.

(00:54:12):
Of those three, how often does this affect you? Is this hourly? Is this daily? Is this weekly? Is this quarterly? Because sometimes it hits you every single day, and you're just mad about it. Sometimes it only hits you once a quarter because it's end of quarter, but it's so onerous, and then kind of open text, like, "Is there anything else we should know?" That can give you incredible signal because by making folks prioritize the top three things... Let them pick everything, it makes the data super, super messy. But three things and how often, you can just come up with a score or a weighted score if you want, and then go kind of dig into, where should that data be? What data do we need? But also, then you've got at least some kind of baseline. It'll be a subjective baseline, but now you'll know what the biggest challenges are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
I love how all this just comes back just starting by talking to people and asking them these things, which is very similar to product management and just building great products is, have you talked to your customers? Everyone thinks they're doing this, but most people are not doing this enough.

Nicole Forsgren (00:55:17):
And I will say one thing that's challenging when you think about getting data, so interviews are data and that's important, surveys are a little more quantified because we can turn it into counts, but that's where we also want to be careful. A lot of folks go to write a survey question and they'll say something like, "Were the build and test system slow or complicated in the last week?" You're asking four different questions there. If someone answers yes, was it the build? Was it the test? Was it slow or was it flaky or complicated or something? So it can be really difficult to untangle what the signal is you're actually getting there, and so it is worth the time chatting with someone who's familiar with survey design, having a conversation with Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT around, "Here are the survey questions. Or can you propose some?" And then make sure you take a couple of rounds. Is this a good survey question? What questions can I answer from the data that I get? What problems could I solve? If you can't answer a question with data, don't get it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
And you have example surveys in your book for folks that want to just copy and paste and not have to think about this much.

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:28):
Yeah, example surveys, a lot of example questions. We even recommend what the format, what the flow should look like, how long it should be, how long it should not be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
One thing that I was reading is that you don't love happiness surveys specifically, asking engineers how happy they are, is that true? If so, why is that?

Nicole Forsgren (00:56:45):
I don't, no. Well, I'll say I don't love a happiness survey because there are too many things that contribute to happiness. Happiness is a lot, right? So happiness is work, happiness is family, happiness is hobbies, happiness is weekends, happiness... There are so many things that contribute to happiness. Now, that doesn't mean I don't care about happiness. I think happiness surveys are not particularly useful here. What can be helpful is satisfaction and people are like, "That's the same thing." It's not because you can ask, "Are you satisfied with this tool?" and then ask some follow-up questions. Now, those two are related because the more satisfied you are with your job and your tools and the work and your team, it contributes to happiness. I used to joke... Remember the golf commercials like, "Happy cows like happy cheese"?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):
No.

Nicole Forsgren (00:57:35):
I had a Calabrian. That was the best. Happy devs make happy code. They write better programs, they do better work, they're better team members and collaborators. But capturing and trying to directly influence happiness, that's not what we are here for. It's too challenging, it's too all-encompassing. Satisfaction can give us some signal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:59):
In a totally different direction, in terms of just tools you see people using, are there any that just like, "Oh, yeah, this one's really commonly great." For people, this is just a tool people are finding a lot of success with. There's the common ones, Copilot, Cursor. I don't know. Is there anything that stands out that you want to share, just like, "Hey, you should check this tool out. People seem to love it"?

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:21):
I think they're huge, right? Copilot, Cursor, Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):
Claude Code.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:26):
Yep, Claude Code. I love Claude Code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):
I have a whole post coming on ways to use Claude Code for non-engineering use cases.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:35):
Cool. Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
It's so interesting. For example, Claude Code, "Find ways to clean up storage on my laptop," and it just tells you there's a bunch of files. It's just like ChatGPT running on your computer and you could do all kinds of crazy stuff on your computer for you, like a mini God.

Nicole Forsgren (00:58:36):
I'm going to do that now. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
It's so good. Yeah, that's why I'm writing this. I had Dan Shipper was on the podcast and he said Claude Code is the most underrated AI tool out there because people don't realize what it's capable of. It's not just for coding, and that's what I'm trying to explore more and more. Okay. Is there anything else that you think would be valuable to help people improve their developer experience, help them adapt to this new world of AI and engineering that we haven't covered?

Nicole Forsgren (00:59:22):
I think something that's important to think about in general is to bring a product mindset to any type of DevEx improvements that are happening, and also the metrics that we collect and capture. By that, I mean we want to identify a problem, make sure we're solving a problem for a set of users. We want to think about creating MVPs and experiments and get fast feedback, do some rapid iteration. We want to have a strategy. We want to know who our addressable market is. We want to know what success is. We want to basically have a go-to-market function. We need to have comms. We need to get continuous feedback from our customers. We want to keep improving. And, at some point, we want to think about sunsetting something. Is it in maintenance mode? Is it sun setting?

(01:00:12):
And I think that's important in general, but I think it's extra important now because when we have AI tools, we're using AI tools, we're embedding AI into our products, things are changing so rapidly that it can be really important to take half a beat and say, "Okay, what's the problem I'm trying to solve right here? Is this metric that we've had for the last 10 years still important or should this be sunset because it's not really important anymore? It's not driving the types of decisions and actions that I need."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:40):
Before we get to our exciting lightning round, I want to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. Is there some way that you've found a use for an AI tool in your life, in your work that you think might be fun to share, that you think might be useful to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:00:55):
I have been working on some home design and redecorating rooms and stuff. I'm working with a designer because I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, I'm not good at this. But I've really been loving ChatGPT and Gemini especially to render pictures for me, so I can give it the floor plan, I can give it one shot of the room that's definitely not what it's supposed to look like, and then I can give it pictures of a couple different things, and then I can just tell it change the walls or change the furniture layout or change something. It helps me and it's relatively quick. It helps me kind of visualize the things... Again, I know what I like, but I don't know how to get there, so I know if I like it or not, which is probably a very random use, but it's fun for now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
My wife does exactly the same thing. She's sending me constantly, "Here's what this rug will look like in our living room. Here's this water feature." It's so good and it keeps getting better. It's just like, "Wow, that's exactly our house with this new rug," and all you do is just upload these two photos and just like, "Cool. How would this look in our room?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've been impressed a couple times. Definitely the machines are listening to us. It's given me a mock-up of a room or something and then it throws in a dog bed, because I have dogs. I'm like, "I did not tell you to do that, but yeah, that's probably the color and style of dog bed that I should have in this room."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):
Speaking of that, have you tried this use case, ask ChatGPT, "Generate an image of what you think my house looks like based on everything you know about me."

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:22):
I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
Because it has memory and it remembers everything you've talked about, and it's hilarious. You got to do it.

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:29):
Okay, that's on my to-do list.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
There we go. Bonus use case. Nicole, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:38):
Awesome. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:39):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Nicole Forsgren (01:02:43):
Outlive by Peter Attia is fantastic. Another one that's I guess maybe related, I hurt my back so it's not great, Back Mechanic by Stuart McGill is incredible. Shout out to anyone who has hurt lower back. It's for a lay person to read through and figure out how to fix lower back problems. It's kind of a random one. I will say I love How Big Things Get Done. I can't pronounce the names. I think one's... There's Scandinavian, one is. It kind of dissects really large projects through recent-ish history and where they failed and why. And I think it's really interesting for us to think about, especially now in this AI moment where basically all of our at least software systems are going to be changing. So how do we think about approaching what is essentially going to be a very large project? And then, sorry, I'm going to throw in a bonus one, The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis. Matt Velloso recommended it to me, and it's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Yes, I read that-

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:44):
I audibly gasped at the last sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
Oh. I was like, "What?"

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:47):
I was [inaudible 01:03:48]. Yeah, I was not expecting it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
I read that and I do not remember that last sentence. Oh, man. Okay, cool. Next question. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you recently watched and enjoyed?

Nicole Forsgren (01:03:57):
I'll say I watch Love Is Blind. If I got to shut down at the end of the day, Love Is Blind is fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):
There's a new season out.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:03):
Yeah, very excited... and Shrinking. Have you seen Shrinking?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
No. I think I started The Therapist and yeah, I gave it a shot.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:12):
Strongly recommend it. It's cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
Sweet. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be some kitchen gadgets, some clothing.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:21):
Yeah, the Ninja Creami is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Did you say this last time?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:25):
I don't know. I may have. I don't think so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:29):
Somebody said this and I still remember it. It's like-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:30):
It's so good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
... you make ice cream and stuff with it, right?

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:33):
Yeah, and you can basically freeze a protein shake and then it turns it into ice cream-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
Oh, man.

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:37):
... which is delicious. Another one is a Jura coffee maker. I'd love good coffee and I'm not great at making it, so I can just push the button and it'll give me anything I want, including lattes, cappuccinos or anything. So that's kind of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
Sweet, okay. Do you have a favorite-

Nicole Forsgren (01:04:54):
Just sugar and caffeine. I just need a power through the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
There's the engineering productivity 101.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:01):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):
Oh, man. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or life and come back to in various ways?

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:09):
Yeah, I think one that's come up a couple times, it's not a verbatim thing, I think it's more the vibe, hindsight is 2020, but it's also really dumb. I think if we made the best decision we could at the time with the information that we had available, then it is what it is. If you make a bad decision because you made a bad decision and you knew better, you had the information, not great. I don't think we give ourselves or other people enough grace because we always end up finding more information out later.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Hear, hear. Final question. I was going to ask you something else, but as we are preparing for this, you shared that you have a new role at Google. Maybe just talk about that, what you're up to there, why you joined Google, anything folks should know.

Nicole Forsgren (01:05:53):
Sure. I am senior director of developer intelligence and core developer. It's super exciting and super fun because of all of these things we've been talking about. It's focused on Google and all their properties and their underlying infrastructure, how can we improve developer experience, developer productivity, velocity, all of these things we've been talking about and, because kind of the numbers person, how do we want to think about measuring it, how does measurement change, how do feedback loops change, how can we improve the experience throughout and then kind of drive that change through an organization in ways that are meaningful and impactful and faster than they've been before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:33):
Nice job, Google, getting Nicole. What a win. I need to get some more Google stock ASAP. Okay, two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online and find your book online if they want to dig deeper? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Nicole Forsgren (01:06:47):
Online, you can find the book at developerexperiencebook.com, I'm at nicolefv.com, and LinkedIn occasionally. Sometimes it's a mess. I try to wade through all of the noise. I get there to be useful, sign up for the book and the workbooks. The workbooks are free. I'd love to get any kind of feedback on what works, what doesn't. I always love hearing those kind of stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
Nicole, thank you so much for being here.

Nicole Forsgren (01:07:17):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

## Transcript

Nikhyl Singhal (00:00:00):
When I was a kid and I was growing up in the Midwest, entertainment was like going to the dog tracks. The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits. These tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. And what was interesting is the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, they would never run again because there was like, "Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for." So I think this happens a ton, it's like your listeners are spending time focused on like, "Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company." But they don't think about what happens next. What's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you know nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed.

Lenny (00:01:05):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikhyl Singhal. Nikhyl has worked on and led large teams on four different influential consumer products including Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos. Currently, he leads product teams for the Facebook app at Meta, overseeing groups, stories, messaging, and the feed. Before that, he served as chief product officer at Credit Karma and held various leadership roles at Google. Nikhyl has also co-founded three different startups, and as you'll hear in this episode, is extremely passionate about coaching and mentoring, sharing his knowledge through his newsletter and podcast called The Skip.

Lenny (00:01:47):
In our conversation, we cover all aspects of the PM career and what it takes to be successful at every stage of the journey, including the dangers of thinking too short term, the importance of avoiding what he calls ex-growth companies, why you're probably not getting promoted, what to focus on if you're a new manager, the rise of the senior IC path, also why top leaders often have huge development areas they don't know about and how to catch them, and also why people who make it to the top often run into serious mental health challenges. As I say at the end of this episode, this might be my new favorite episode and I'm really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Nikhyl Singhal after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Nikhyl, welcome to the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:04:43):
Thank you, Lenny. I appreciate it. I'm happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:45):
So I have a very simple question to start. How many product managers have you been a mentor to if you had to put a number on it?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:04:53):
Good question. I guess I haven't thought about it from that perspective. I would say hundreds is probably the way to sort of answer the question, and a little bit has to do with whether how we define being a mentor. I know that was supposed to be a simple question and I'm going to give you a complicated answer, but I think that I started out just helping people 10, 15 years ago, trying to help them through their careers. I find the whole area really interesting. And then what happened was just I started to scale because people were always like, "Hey, can you find time?"

Nikhyl Singhal (00:05:22):
So now what I do is I tend to help and coach hundreds of folks through transitions. So if they're in a moment where they're trying to decide between another job, if they're trying to decide to leave, if they're having sort of an alert at work, I call them 911 calls. I take a few 911 calls every week and from a relatively large group of people. So I find those are the most substantive times to help people, is when they're in moments of dilemma or forks in the road, and that's why the number is more closer to hundreds.

Lenny (00:05:54):
Okay. Follow-up question: How many of those people you've mentored have been on this podcast?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:05:58):
Probably half dozen to kind of close to a dozen at this point.

Lenny (00:06:02):
Oh, wow.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:03):
Yeah, easily half dozen.

Lenny (00:06:06):
Amazing. Okay. Is there any names you want to name or should we keep it anonymous?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:09):
Yeah. We'll keep it anonymous because I want people to feel they can always call me in and not feel like that. I don't tend to share the names of most people.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Okay. I know the one person that self-identified was Annie Pearl from Calendly, who is a big advocate of the stuff that you do. So we don't want-

Nikhyl Singhal (00:06:23):
Yeah. Annie is someone I learned from and helped talk with, and she's also part of a community that I also build on the side where we pulled a bunch of CPOs together and they've been building community. I'm a big fan of community and learning, and she's part of that as well.

Lenny (00:06:39):
Awesome. I definitely want to talk about that, but maybe just set a little context for our conversation. I feel like you're in the very high percentiles of people that have seen a variety of careers in product management, both good careers, bad careers, junior people, senior people. So I want to focus most of our time on talking about just the PM career path and what you've learned about what is important to have a successful, thriving, happy PM career. Does that sound good?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:07:07):
Perfect.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Okay. So I'm thinking we break up the chat into early career, mid-career, and late career. So within the early career section, you've talked about how people often make a mistake in their early career, specifically being very short-term focused in deciding where they're going to go. And that's a very dangerous way of thinking about it. So I'd love to hear just your take on exactly what does that mean, and why is that actually a bad idea?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:07:33):
Yeah. I tend to be long-term focused in most of my counsel, and maybe to give you an example of what a short-term focus career kind of framework looks like is, "I really dislike my boss. I feel like this company doesn't have it anymore. There's just too hard to ship things." Those are all maybe true statements, but they probably exist in many of the jobs that one would consider if they were to move for one to another. Lateral moves are by definition not forward moves. So what I try to tell people to think about is work backwards from your end state.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:08:12):
Almost think of career as a product. So if you're building a good product, you think about, "Well, here's what a great product would look like," and then you break it into version one, version two, version three. Well, in some ways the reason I called my newsletter, my podcast The Skip is because I always think about not the next job, but the one after it. Maybe think about not your boss's job but your boss's boss's job and what do I need to think about to get there. And in many ways you may think, "Well, okay, if I need to found a company one day and that's my job after next," then you want to look at maybe your current job and then maybe the next job in service of that. And that may lead you to saying, "Hey, maybe I need a grit of doubt and maybe I should stay and maybe I should learn how to deal with some of this ambiguity. That's why I want people to be a bit more longer term and not so short-term focused.

Lenny (00:09:07):
What are some other examples of that short-term thinking? You talked about "my manager sucks, things are moving really slowly." What other examples where people maybe like, "Oh, okay, I see, this is actually short term. Let me think longer term"?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:09:17):
I'd say the biggest one in workplace is focusing career and promotion together. I think that there's perhaps a light connection between promotion and career addition, but I feel like too many people are, the moment we talk about career, they're like, "Well, let me talk to you. I want to have a career talk with you." And I said, "Sure, why don't you find some time?" We sit down together and they're like, "Well, what do you think I need to do to get to promotion?" And then I said, "Well, promotion is our system at this company to see you moving forward. And it's pretty clear in terms of levels and what you're doing and what the process is and who makes the decision." And that's pretty short term because you can ask, "Hey, it's two years away, how do I make it 18 months?" It's a classic.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:10:09):
But in reality, if you're thinking career, you're thinking about the sort of long term arc and, as I said, maybe the job after next, and then you need to look at the promotion in service because how many people have you and I talked to who said, "Well then, as soon as I get promoted, I'm going to leave"? So then I'm like, "Well, okay, then what's the promotion in service of?" And you get into that conversation, which tends to be, again, very long-term focused.

Lenny (00:10:36):
This makes me think about this interesting two-sided challenge with thinking about your future career and where you want to go. On the one hand, it's valuable to think about getting more logos in your resume and working at Netflix and Meta and Airbnb and Uber, all these guys, there's power and value to that. On the other hand, you just keep doing that. And then what is your life turning into? You're just chasing more fancy logos and feeling better about better brands and your resume and stuff. This might be too big a question, but just how do you advise people to think about how important it's to get some of these companies in your resume and build that side of it versus just doing things you actually enjoy and having a fulfilling life and doing things that are meaningful to you?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:11:18):
Yeah. I mean I think collecting labels does feel shallow to most builders because if you're a product person, you probably got into the business because you like building stuff. And frankly, not just product people want to do that, a lot of technical people want to just build stuff. And then the question is, is the things that you're working on in service of building? And then when you ask people, "Were you happy?" as they always say, "Well, when I was able to build this thing," and oftentimes they don't care whether it worked or not, which is kind of ironic. So for me, when I see people chasing logos, I think about it as well. I'm actually really a big fan of a diverse set of experiences, that I think learning about pre-product market fit then seeing smoke turn into fire and witnessing and maybe shepherding that and then taking fire and turning it into something great and being an experience set where you can see the movie in these different frames makes you just a better builder.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:12:20):
So you can't really go wrong if you're looking at those experiences. And you're looking at inside the building problems and outside the building problems, those are maybe consumer problems and business-to-business problems. The more diverse career you have, the better builder you are. And that usually comes up being satisfied. But the idea of just doing that because you think it's going to make your chances better for the next job maybe scares me and it feels very much in service of some future dream that is not build oriented. And I think that can be leading to sadness.

Lenny (00:12:54):
I love that advice, and I say this often actually on this podcast, the power of a diversity of experiences for so many reasons. Maybe just to close this loop, would you agree there is a lot of value in having one of these FAANG ish companies on your resume? Like a lot of opportunity gets unlocked if you work at one of these companies that people are like, "Oh wow, okay, this person's interesting." Or not? Or do people maybe overthink that?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:13:17):
Generically, the answer is yes. I think it's especially important for executives. I think that many executives are hired because they are to bring expertise of the next phase of organization to this company. We're growing, we want to go after the next phase. We want someone who's has expertise. The MAGMA or FAANG companies, however you want to describe them, they really have challenges and expertise at how to build things at scale, how to manage millions or billions of users and customers. So the advantage is, to be successful at that is an endorsement. Having said that, those specific companies, experiences can be substituted for other later stage companies, but if you're coming in as an executive to bring someone to the next level and you've never experienced it, it's very difficult thing to get that executive experience and to be like a C-level for that growth company.

Lenny (00:14:26):
To point out, FAANG is no longer accurate because Facebook is now Meta. So MAGMA is the term that you prefer.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:14:33):
I prefer that. I think it unfortunately kicks out Netflix, but it also doesn't pay homage to Adobe and Salesforce and a number of other great companies. So I think-

Lenny (00:14:42):
FAANG doesn't. Okay, I like this. Okay, let's try to make MAGMA the new thing. MAGMA, make that the title of this episode. Just joking.

Lenny (00:14:50):
So the next area I want to touch on is, you wrote this kind of hot take on something you call ex-growth companies and how it's not good to be at an ex-growth company currently. So can you just talk about what is an ex-growth company and then why is that not a good place to be as a product manager for probably any kind of role?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:15:09):
I have a pretty strong opinion on this that I think that for 10 years we created the hypergrowth, blitzscaling type phenomenon, and there was a lot of good reasons for that, some of which were just distribution platforms just got so good. You could take out Facebook ads, you could grow with Google, and you could grow in 18 months that maybe took previous companies 10 years. So I think that the idea was that all of these companies could instantly grow when they found product market fit and that birthed all these unicorns. And then suddenly, 18 months ago, it almost like the music stopped. 0% interest rate went away, and it became a lot harder to find growth through just fueling it with capital. And I think that the sudden change meant that not only capital was harder to raise, but companies started to focus on their core products. You've talked about it on this podcast, just how many layoffs and restructuring and managers moving to ICs, and all of that work is happening.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:16:16):
Well, the one funny pocket was there's these large number of growth companies who have raised substantive dollars. So they're not going to run out of capital in 2022 or 2023. What's going to happen is, they actually have quite long periods of time, so you don't see them raising new rounds, you don't see them laying off, but in some ways they're still hiring or they're still seeking the next product. The sad truth is that many of their contemporary companies that went public are worth 10% or less than what they were worth back then, and these companies are privately held and so they're sort of sleeping in the shadows.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:17:07):
My fear is, from a career point of view, so many tech professionals are in these organizations or joining these organizations with the expectation that they'll make money on their equity, that they'll continue to do fine. And my sense is we're going to see, even in the second half of this year, lots of boards pulling back, taking their capital back, companies essentially saying, "Hey, we're capitalized. We're a scaled ocean liner, and now we need to go find product market fit." But doing that with 300 people and expectations of hitting a multi-billion dollar valuation just isn't going to happen. So that's the reason why I'm like, "Danger. This is not the company to join, this is the company to leave. Find another phase. Time's a wasting." And I worry very much that people aren't getting the message.

Lenny (00:18:00):
I know you probably don't want to name any names of companies, but what are some signs that may be you're at one of these companies?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:18:07):
I think that the moment that you are reframing the core product, trying to find that product market implies that this company's valuation needs to be a pre-product market fit valuation. So the two questions you ask yourself the day after we listen to this podcast is, "Hey, are we scaling a product? We have customers that love us and we have a tremendous sucking sound? Or are we trying to find that customer sucking sound?" And if the answer is, "We're still trying to find it," and then you're like, "Is your evaluation hundreds of millions or tens of millions?" and if the answer is hundreds or more and you're still trying to find that sucking sound, you're an ex-growth company.

Lenny (00:18:57):
As a founder listening to this, I bet you're like, "Damn, we don't want people leaving. This isn't the kind of message we want to hear." On the other hand, as an employee at a company, that is your advice, just generally recognize it and then you should probably leave as soon as possible because things are not going to work out for you.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:19:15):
As an employee, I think you have almost no recourse because you almost have to start over in terms of it's a new four-year investment. I think that as a founder, you can recap your company. You can reset your stock price, you could reissue. You can make those hard decisions and you can maybe return some of the money to the board and still continue, or you can pull the plug and restart the company that maybe you really wanted to. But I think the founder is in a better position, but they also have a lot more to lose and far more constraints. But employees, they're not... If you listen to this and come to this conclusion, a lot of times, the listeners here, half or more of their compensation is an equity and we just concluded that most of their equity may not be worth anything. In which case, are you willing to take a half pay cut or work for 20% of what you can get on the market? My question is, that seems to be quite concerning, the opportunity cost is just too rich.

Lenny (00:20:19):
An important variable in this framework/piece of advice is product market fit. This might be too big of a question, but just, what tells you that something might have not have product market fit when you're at a company like this? What are signs to you and smoke signals of like, "They may not have product market fit"?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:20:36):
For me, it's always around this pull that sort of how much work do you have to do to basically generate pull? So right now with OpenAI for example, we're seeing ridiculous pull, but we may not be seeing, for example, massive revenue or profitability. So that's the reason why I tend to feel like you can kind of tell by how hard it is to acquire your users. When companies are putting very little in marketing and there're people coming into the door or there's such an easy sale, you've got it. I think that this sucking pull kind of concept feels like the most appropriate way to define it as opposed to the sort of unit economics of acquisition and time to pay back. There are lots of mathy ways to do it, but early on you can tell how hard are you working to bring people in the door.

Lenny (00:21:32):
Is there any reason to consider staying at a company like this?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:21:35):
There are counter examples. I think the counterpoint is, this is the biggest role that you feel like you could get and you have an appetite to sort of learn like, "I'm on the executive team, I'm not going to get that somewhere else. That experience is career additive. I want that moment." Great. Sometimes I see loyalty come in, "This was my baby. I feel a commitment to the team, the team that I've made, et cetera."

Lenny (00:22:07):
Yeah.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:22:08):
I actually respect that. I think that you have to put bounds on that. I think that you should have that conversation. But the learning position, the loyalty tend to be the primary reasons to maybe delay the decision, but fear of finding another job is a bad reason, but is an often common reason as well.

Lenny (00:22:34):
Now that we've given many listeners an existential crisis, let me move on to another question within the early career phase and then I'm going to move on to mid-career. I guess the question is just, is there any other piece of advice, wisdom for early PMs? Maybe the question is, what do you think they should most get right in their early career?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:22:56):
There's probably two answers that I would share. One is, they want to build something that they as much as possible are world-class in. So if you think about the different types of product ambiguities that exist in industry, you can be a great crafter. You could be incredibly strong at market ambiguity. You could understand how to navigate markets and create something new that doesn't exist. You can be great at organizational ambiguity. I know how to take complex teams that have complex goals and solve an inside the building problem. You can be a domain expert. I'm an ML expert, I'm a really strong hardware PM. You can be a team expert. I just really thrive in managing managers and I just know how to get the balance right. So, being a product manager means you're confronted with maybe all five or maybe more of these. I want to know that you pick up one of these as early as possible.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:24:07):
So maybe you become an expert in domain, maybe you become a great crafter, maybe you really think through how to manage growth. Growth is another one that I would add to the list. But picking a lane is kind of goal number one. And then maybe goal number two is having a story to tell to that next employer and that next, next. What I worry about is, sometimes when I'm in an interview, and you and I have probably done hundreds, and you're talking to someone and then they talk about those early jobs and they just sort of said they were there, this happened and it's very hard to connect, tell me exactly what you learned and what you did, I want to know that story. So it's just like Amazon talks about building the press release before they start creating a product. Think about the story, think about the skill, then solve your day to day, your week to week, your month to month, your performance review. That's my biggest advice I seize.

Lenny (00:25:12):
I love that advice. It connects to your other earlier piece of advice, of just try to get a variety of experiences because that'll help you figure out which of these things is maybe best suited for what you're interested in, what you enjoy doing.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:25:24):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny (00:25:25):
Awesome. So let's transition to mid-career. Let's talk about promotions. You mentioned getting promoted earlier. We chatted a bit about that. There's probably no one ever that didn't want to get promoted. It's a common topic in people's career, but a lot of times people don't understand why they're not getting promoted, they're not sure people are looking for to get promoted. You've promoted a lot of people and you've gone through a lot of promotions. What would be your advice to give people who are trying to get promoted and just haven't been promoted? What would you suggest people in that position generally do?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:25:57):
Yeah, it's a great question. I think that we want to kind of understand why, and oftentimes asking your manager won't reveal the answer. So then you'll start with that. I think that the answer of what you do is correlated with what's the real reason. And I think that there may be, I'll suggest four kind of common things I've seen that really hold people back. And then depending on your environment, you have to decide how many of these apply.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:26:25):
So I think the number one is that you just don't have advocacy. You need someone to see the magic in you to be promoted. There is many of your listeners who have that magic but maybe have a manager or a promotion team, it doesn't always have to be the manager itself, who doesn't see said magic. And in that case, if you have the magic, you're in a bad setting and you just need to change. That could be a shift within the project. You could find a manager who sees it. It could be leaving the company. I think the second that's very common now, Lenny, and I think it's coming up a ton, is the next role doesn't exist.

Lenny (00:27:10):
Mm-hmm.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:27:11):
So this is not as present in hypergrowth because the next role always did exist. There was always growth, there was always hiring, you're always hiring people above you, below you, et cetera. Now, I think there's lots of examples of people who are really qualified and working at the next level, but the job doesn't exist. So you can't really create that job and ask them to be working at that next job if their position is mostly the previous one. Again, I feel like it's not that satisfying because it means you're still being held back, but it's radically different than if you're unqualified. These two are sort of more, the system is not in a position to advocate.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:27:58):
The third is when you are being impatient. And I think the hardest ones that I think I've worked with is, the highest performers have succeeded because they have set their goals to be more aggressive than what was essentially average achievable. By default, we expect you to be two years in this role. They're like, "Great, I'll see you in a year." And then they get frustrated when they can't do that, and leadership takes longer to absorb. It's more soft skills, it's more subtle. Oftentimes it's based on impact, which is a lot of times lagging, and that tends to be frustrating. So if listeners are like, "I know I'm used to being promoted annually and now I'm a leader and I'm not moving as quickly, it's time for me to go," I'm like, well, maybe that's working as intended. So impatience is a number three.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:28:54):
And then the fourth one I think is about 50% of the cases where it's really, there is a development area but it isn't quite connected to the individual. The listener has a development area, it's substantive. The manager is poor at identifying it, perhaps even doesn't see it, but the promotion committee does, the individual refuses to hear it, which is a very common one. Or they hear it and they just don't want to change it. And they don't do it because they're arrogant, they do it because it's like, "This is who I am. You want me to be X and I'm Y, and that's what a Y is and I don't want to be X." This is the hardest one because this is where coaching and development and self-awareness come in.

Lenny (00:29:46):
Amazing. This super resonates. So just to summarize the four reasons you may not be getting promoted: One is, there's no advocate that sees your magic and understands that you're awesome. Two is, there's no actual role that's available and so there's nothing to get promoted to. And that's so true right now, there's just not. Everyone's laying people off, they're getting rid of manager layers. I totally see that all over the place. Three is, you're probably just not being patient. Four, you actually have some work to do and you shouldn't be promoted. Maybe to follow a thread on that first one, if someone doesn't see your magic, I see a lot of people just complaining that like, "Oh, I'm doing so well, I'm so great and nobody understands it. No one gives me credit. No one really appreciates me." I don't know if there is an answer to this, but is there a way to help people see that no, you're actually not doing great versus you are and people just don't see it? What's a sign maybe? Maybe you're not as great as you think you might be.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:30:41):
The cheap answer is you have to get real feedback, not formal feedback. I think that the more scaled the company is, the more they have these systems in place which provide formal feedback. But honestly, we've run experiments where we said let's ignore the formal feedback, let's have a real conversation with my peers on how our teams are doing. The signal that comes out are dramatically different than the formal feedback. So what you're looking for when you feel like you're in this situation where you're not being seen, and it might be because there's a real issue, what you really want to dial into is, "Let me get the ground truth as to what people are thinking," and you have to have very strong listener skills where we all have been in the discussion, where you're giving feedback to someone and the next thing that they tell you is they justify how you're wrong, that you missed this. "Let me tell you about exactly why that situation that you're using wasn't..."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:31:43):
You have to be great at pulling feedback, listening to it. You have to triangulate it from people that don't see you all the time, that do see you all the time, your peers. But you have to create an environment of safety where people feel like there is no worry about retaliation or concern, et cetera. And the more comfortable people are about giving feedback to you and the more you have the skills to pull it and you don't trust formal or you don't trust manager, the better shot you have of truly understanding what that real issue is and solving it.

Lenny (00:32:16):
This reminds me of Jules Walter who's on the podcast. He gave a bunch of advice. I don't know if you saw that. I've had to accept feedback and get people to give you feedback. And one of its pieces of advice is, ask people for real feedback. And no matter how much you're melting inside hearing it, just be like, "Thank you so much for that." Because then, people feel like, "All right, he's listening."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:32:34):
I think Jules is a great, probably one of the world's best people in pulling feedback in my experience. I think that the one that even ones up it is, when I talk to Jules, Jules will look for feedback, then he'll repeat it back to me better than even I presented it. And then I'd say, "Well, let me now feel safer to even provide." Because anyone who's explaining it to a place that they all not only internalize it but they can articulate clearly understands and values it. And that's the really powerful way is, "So what you're saying is I just interrupt far too often and some ways it's almost to a point that it's annoying. Is that a fair assessment?" "Oh, that's actually not the words I use," but that's what really gets people comfortable in sharing with you what's really going on.

Lenny (00:33:24):
Amazing. I think we're discovering some of these people that have worked with you that have been on the podcast slowly. Maybe while we're on this topic, I didn't expect to go here, but in terms of other tips for getting good feedback, is there anything else that just comes top of mind of how to get better feedback from people? Because it's hard to do. Most people talk about getting feedback and then don't, or they just don't know how. So one is just, you said repeat back exactly what they told you and be like very appreciative. Is there anything else?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:33:51):
I'd share out feedback. It's a little easier when you are a manager, but for example, most managers that are listening have a staff discussion. Maybe it's sort of awkward, but maybe you have a standup and you are giving notes to people. So as a manager, someone will come to me and they'll give me a piece of feedback. The next Monday when I have my staff meeting, I'll make a comment about something and I'll say, "Well, lot of this came because I got this great piece of feedback from..." and I'll name the person, and I'm like, "It really helped me see this challenge." Now, that feedback could be about me or about this project or about the team. And it might be positive, it might be constructive. People hear that and they're like, "Wow, I get recognized for giving this guy feedback. Sign me up." You're always trying to find way to break down that barrier.

Lenny (00:34:45):
I love that tip. You talked about managers and how often managers are not great at managers. Maybe they don't identify development areas, maybe they're bad in other areas. So maybe just a question here of just, why are managers often not great? And then two, if you're a new manager, I think a lot of listeners are maybe transitioning to management or about to transition, what's your advice for being successful as a new manager?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:35:12):
I'll start by saying that, in a hundred years when the archeologists look back and they see tech in the sort of early years of tech, the first 34 years, they'll say that the biggest surprise was how much we thought it was okay to not train managers. The military probably didn't make that mistake for very long before they corrected it. And most immature industries really train managers, but boy, if you're a good coder, you are ready to manage. That's the way the industry works. If you can talk, you are ready to product manage. If you can product manage and ship something out the door, you should definitely tell people what to do. I think that there's such a loose coupling between the skills to be successful at building things and teaching people how to build. It's the difference between if you can make a good car, you must know how to make the factory that makes the car. I don't think that's true at all.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:36:18):
I think that this is a massive epidemic, that I think there's the thousand challenges that stem from this, whether it's challenges around bias, challenges around enabling coaching and teaching and solving development areas. My hope is that one day as an industry we find ways to improve and fix it. But podcasts like yours are actually quite meaningful steps. I would say that your podcast might be more meaningful than most L&D departments in most organizations today. So that's powerful because you're having a tremendous amount of impact, and I think learning is essentially a lifelong opportunity and I think that is the type of resources that just didn't exist a decade ago.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:37:03):
I think to answer your question around what are the common pitfalls, if you're a first time manager listening or maybe someone who's considering it, I think there are probably two quick things that I would say you have to get bravely thoughtful about as you enter into this journey. One is, your challenge is going to be to share the steering wheel with the person or the set of people you are managing. And I think that there's this three modes that people have in their head. They're like, "Oh, management is divide and conquering. You go there, I go there, we meet up."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:37:39):
Or they'll say it's like riding a bike, or teaching to ride a bike, I should say. Someone starts out on the bicycle, I hold your hand, I let go, and then I hope that you fly. I think it's more like the sidecar on the motorcycle, where person's driving the motorcycle and I'm on the sidecar and whether I like it or not, I'm attached, but I have this relatively specific role of giving counsel. I think that that model of how do you share the steering wheel, not just say you got it or I got it or I got it for a while, and then I hand it to you is the key question.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:38:15):
And then I think that the second miss that people tend to have is they tend to, because they have power, by the way, organizational power, not because they've earned that power, they start managing whatever they define that to be. And what I find is that you're more like the vampire knocking on the door of someone. You have to be invited in. You just can't walk through the threshold. And I think that no matter how senior the person that is the manager, you have to earn the right to be the person's manager. So maybe to be specific, well, if I start managing someone, the thing I'd like to understand is like, "Hey, well, what can I help you with?" And they can invite me in. Oftentimes, the answer is, "I don't need you. I actually wasn't excited about you as a manager. I don't need another layer between you and the CEO. Get out." And I'm like, "That's cool," because anything I say after that is just going to be annoying and it's going to backfire.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:39:20):
Now, one day they will need help, and I will be in the sidecar waiting to say, "Perhaps I can assist." And then when you finally get to that moment where you're invited in, you pick an area or two, and then you really partner with that person on that area. I can give examples on that, but I generally think that it's this invitation picking specific and then making sure we're sharing the responsibility is the key set of notes that I would share with you.

Lenny (00:39:51):
What's your take on the IC path, senior IC path, something that a lot of companies talk about? I know Meta is big on this right now, the layering managers and things like that. I find a lot of times there's a lot of talk about it and there's not really a real career opportunity there. I guess, what's your just take on as that is a real option for most people trying to basically avoid the manager out and staying in IC, PM long term?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:40:17):
Yeah, I think that it's a little bit more acute now because of the backlash that we talked about between growth where management was perceived. So in this case, management was perceived as a way to drive expansion. So if you're in charge of expansion, you're managing the people that are doing the build and now we're doing a lot fewer things. So I think that's what's mandated this sort of growth in the IC track, for lack of a better term. I think it is one of the best things that happened to our industry because what's happened is, in the last 10 years, and you can tell I'm particularly hard on our managers here, they've basically been promising ICs that early promoted into management. They didn't get taught, and now they're sort of average managers and promising ICs. But now the story that they tell and what they've built is not awesome.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:41:22):
If I'm looking to hire, if I'm in a growth company and I'm the next hottest thing and I'm looking to hire someone and someone walks into the interview and said, "Look, I've managed two people before and then I was in the charge of this thing, but they really did the details. And then by the way before that, I was early in trying to get this thing out the door and then they picked me to be manager," I'm like, "Okay, that's an interesting set of experiences. I'm looking, for me, in my company to build something."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:41:47):
The next person walks in, it's like, "I've been an IC for that whole time. And during that time I went from learning something to demonstrating it to really being able to take it forward. And I got one of these ambiguities master. I'm an expert in domain. I'm an expert in managing organizations," I'm like, "I don't need a team ambiguous expert. That's not my hard part. My hard part is actually cracking the code on this complex market or this very complicated organization where we have two teams that have different goals. You're the type of person I want."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:42:19):
So I think Lenny, to your question, I think the IC track is one of the best things that's going to happen for people career. But to your point, those tracks, from a promotion and from a industry, how we perceive it, they're not in cement yet. They're tender. You wait six months, you wait nine months, they'll become very, very strong and solid. And I think then, we'll be able to lean very hard into them as a real promising crack for builders.

Lenny (00:42:54):
Your sense is, this is going to become more and more real as these layoffs have happened and kind of pullbacks on growth have happened.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:43:00):
Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, it's the reality in engineering and design. So in engineering, you can be the sort of VP of engineering or CTO, and in a design, a lot of designers become design managers, a lot of them stay as crafters. And then for whatever reason in product managers, maybe because they were managers in our title, we just all became managers. What about the product? What about the other side? So I actually think it's a bug that has existed for a long time that actually we're going to correct permanently now.

Lenny (00:43:33):
I wonder if part of it for PMs is, once you become a manager, this happens to me, I didn't want to be an IC anymore. It's like, "I'm done with that. I really enjoy this management layer." And I imagine with engineers, maybe they'll enjoy the coding. When I was an engineer I was like, "Oh, I don't want to just sit around and manage. I just want to code." So I wonder if there's any part of that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:43:52):
But a lot of your listeners like to build. And actually, when they talk to their managers, they're like, "I don't know if that job is awesome. It feels like you spend all your time writing docs and telling your boss's boss what to justify resources and headcount. I just want to build stuff. You don't build stuff." So I think there might be some of that. I think that it's not perfect, but I think hopefully builder and IC will become more synonymous.

Lenny (00:44:19):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

Lenny (00:44:46):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic, click-through metrics and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's get eppo.com. And 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:45:27):
Coming back to the manager life and how many managers are not great and also just how do you get better as a manager, what have you found actually is effective in helping new managers become better?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:45:37):
I think I may have come across kind of hard on managers and I think I kind of said, "Hey, your manager and your manager's manager isn't really doing much teaching. Find the right podcast, good luck." And I think that that's a pretty soulless answer. So maybe the way I describe it is, well, I think learning is changing, and there's the self-service tools that are getting better and then there's the structured teaching which I think is weak. And then there's community, which I think whether it's within your company or outside of company, I think is the answer that we'll see more and more. I think community as a way of creating safety, having authentic conversations, feeling that you're not alone, that others are going through the same thing, and then sharing best practices is so powerful. And what social software has done is it has really empowered community.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:46:46):
And now the tools are awesome. How many great communities have Slack channels or Discord channels or Zoom calls? And we do a lot of that in the CPO community that I created. Whether you're a new manager or whether you belong to a diverse group, whether you are new to a company, I think that all of your listeners should be part of an active community where they can be very authentic and very safe. Sometimes it's hard to do that with your coworkers, and so you need to find another community. Unfortunately, those communities are not the easiest to find today, but I believe that the notion of community as a powerful propellant for learning is the critical ingredient and hopefully many people are creating these communities so that new managers can find the right services.

Lenny (00:47:40):
Can you actually talk about this community that you've built? This could be a good time to talk about it. It's called The Skip. Is that right?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:47:45):
Yeah. It's funny, it's all kind of fun products. They were always a reaction to something. They weren't really intentional. I, as you opened the podcast, did really enjoy teaching and coaching. I learned just as much from coaching others as they learned, I think. And yet I couldn't really scale. So I had this summer where I had just come off of being a head of product, and more and more of my people I was talking to were also head of products. What would happen is, I would have these conversations and they would ask me a question. I would say, "Well, that's the same conversation I answered on Tuesday." What you realize is, it's a very lonely job. Being lonely at the top is not just an adage. Really, everyone's so busy now. It's like, how do you have time to connect? Everything's a single player, you don't really have community.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:48:39):
So I thought, "Well, what if I took the half a dozen people I talked to this month?" And I just said, "Hey, all of you are all interested in talking through how to navigate this crazy world of year one, year two, chief product officer. I think you would really gain. I know all of you and I think you can be safe with one another. Why don't we spend some time together?" So we did a WhatsApp channel and we brought a Zoom call. This was during the pandemic, so you really couldn't meet up. And we started talking. We started talking every month, and people were so empowered by the fact that the problem they were hitting was not just them. It was, "My crazy CEO is telling me this." And the next person is like, "Oh yeah? Let me tell you what my person said." And then they would say, "Oh my gosh, that sounds worse than my situation."

Nikhyl Singhal (00:49:33):
But then, we would sit down and say, "Hey, the third person said I actually kind of had this and now I figured out a way out, and here's what I did." And you're like, "Wow, that's amazing. I'm going to try it." The next day they come back, they're like, "It works." And we started to connect and we built this trust, and community building is interesting and powerful work. So six went to 12, and then 12 went to 15, and now we have 28 members. A lot of folks are interested in these types of communities, but I'm so worried about scaling it because it's the enemy of trust and authenticity. So for all of you that are building communities, it's like tree balancing act. But I do think that the goal is to find ways to take all of this sort of like-minded folks that are in these same situations and connect them together. Late stage chief product officer happened to be one of the ones that had some of the most substantial importance to me because of all the coaching I did for that group.

Lenny (00:50:35):
If someone's listening and they're like, "Oh, I need to join this thing," how do they find out about it? How do they potentially apply and try to join?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:50:41):
Well, we have enough members now. There's a LinkedIn area called The Skip CPO Community, and you should contact any of the members that you know and ask them to join. My request and my requirement is that they are, number one, product leaders in their organization and a company that's not early, but that's mid to late. And the reason being is, those sets of problems tend to be the most similar. To be honest, I think this is not the only community that I want to be part of and help create, but this one happens to be the preexisting one. I think there are lots of powerful communities that can be created, but this particular one is very much focused on The Skip CPOs.

Lenny (00:51:28):
Awesome. I'll mention the community around my newsletter just so folks are looking for a community join. I try not to promote these sorts of things, but it's a good time, may as well. If you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, there's a Slack community you get access to. There's about 12, 13,000 people in there. There's meetups happening all over the world every month. It's amazing. Very proud of it. People are getting a lot of value of it, and it's basically open to any level of product manager. Other functions are in there too. So it's a very different sort of experience, but willing to add that also in the show notes if you want to check that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:51:59):
I think that that would be my put, because so many of the managers will say, "Hey, I'm an IC," here's a greater one, "I am not being told I have the next job. I just was told to become an IC and I was a manager. I feel like my learning opportunities are stuck, but this is a bad time to look for a job." They should be in your community. They will learn more from that community than they will learn from managing one random person that they were attached to managing in some project that may or may not see the light of day, yet that's how our society is programmed. Our industry is like, "No, no, go manage that person because that's going to make you closer to the top. Forget learning." And I'm like, "Well, learning isn't happening. Learning's happening in your community. Learning is happening in our communities in general." That's why I'm pushing so hard on this.

Lenny (00:52:54):
This is a good segue to talking about the third bucket, which is kind of later career CPOs. That's the segue in my mind there. Something that I've heard you talk about is that a lot of really senior leaders have real development areas, but they're hiding behind these superpowers that they have. Plus, people don't like to give real feedback to senior people. So I'd love to hear just what you're seeing there and how maybe people can work through that and what we can learn about that issue that you've noticed.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:53:27):
This came from my notes as I was talking to a therapist on this. They talked about the shadows of superpowers. And I thought it was an incredibly powerful phrase that everyone focuses on your superpowers, but no one ever thinks about what shadows they create. Shadows of superpowers to me is the story of a lot of executives. There's an adage that's thrown around, which is, what gets you there isn't what got you here. It's sort of the tools that have made you successful today, you need to almost rebuild or relearn to get to the next phase. And I think both of these sort of speak to the same point, that oftentimes people have a great superpower. They go into a performance review, person says, "You're getting some feedback from your peers that you struggle in collaboration." And the manager even sometimes is puzzled, but the individual will say, "Are you kidding me? My last five performance reviews told me that I was one of the best collaborators in the company. How in the world is that possible?"

Nikhyl Singhal (00:54:42):
And then what you realize is that, "Well, you're collaborating as long as people agreed with your point of view. Now as a leader, we're asking you to be opinionated, and because you just think you're an amazing collaborator using the exact same tool set. And it turns out that when you're dealing with senior people, that may not even be in your function, they may not be product, they may not be tech, they recoil, but you're moving so fast because it's your superpower. You would never think that this needs to be rebuilt." Sometimes it could be more extreme. Great collaborators sometimes are very reticent to present their own opinions because they're so good at assimilating others. Or people that are amazing at growth struggle to be innovative. People that are world-class storytellers struggle to get in the details. People that are very taste maker, they are always the first to have point of view. They don't necessarily introduce change particularly often. You're strong politically, but your decisions are unprincipled. You're a structured thinker, but blue-sky innovations are very tough. You're an amazing listener, but you're very weak to be decisive. I can go on forever.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:56:10):
And what I would say to you is, sometimes even in a 30-minute conversation, walking into the room, just knowing what I know about the person, I can unlock their development area faster than anyone ever before, simply because my secret is, I'll bet you, because of this person's world-class here, these are the three things they're going to hit. And they don't even realize it because it's their identity. This is what got me here. If you make me work on that, you will make me change my superpower. And I'm like, "That's why you're stuck. That's why your career is plateauing." And then they get sad and then they take a long time to process, and then the work actually begins and then they solve and they go. Almost everyone, once they have the name and the face, they're able to solve. But facing the name is hard when it's sitting in the shadows of superpowers.

Lenny (00:57:08):
Wow. That is an incredibly important point. For someone to recognize this, do you find that they need someone like you that's like a coach, mentor, person to come in, and be like, "Here's what I see"? Or is there a way, I guess, as someone that's a peer or an employee to help them recognize this without them shutting down and being like, "No, shut up. No problem'?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:57:28):
No, you don't need a coach. What you do need is to listen to contradictory feedback. So what was the premise here is you're being told that something that you hold as your strength is actually in your way or a development area. Do not dismiss that. Recognize most likely you're doing it correctly. You just have gotten to the next level. So what I'm hoping the listener does is it goes back through all the feedback that they may even have and then looks at all the discard stuff. What's on the discard pile? Things that were discarded are anomalies because they're artifacts of my strength. And often, your managers are the ones that do the discarding, "Oh, that was just a weird... That person, they were just into it. They have it out for you. They got reorged or they were upset." I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Perception's reality. Talk to me about that one. That might be it." That's what I'm looking for.

Lenny (00:58:29):
Fascinating. This makes me think about companies that have the same issue, companies strengths, like say Meta for example, move fast and break things and then, "Oh, that ends up being the biggest Achilles' heel." Uber, similar. Airbnb has similar challenges like that.

Nikhyl Singhal (00:58:43):
Absolutely. This exact thing applies to relationships. This applies to companies, this applies to a lot. And I'm so happy that I was able to learn about it. Frankly, it was a critical unlock for me because I was stuck on something for years and I just could not understand how, for me, it was, I was very opinionated about something. And then I realized being loosely held on my opinions didn't mean that I became a weaker executive, but it was my opinions that got me to be so successful and it required me to rewire who I was as an executive. And that took a lot of time and a lot of energy. But it came from this realization and then I started to apply it for other strength areas. And now, every time I have a strength area of myself for those that I coach, I immediately talk through all the things that I bet you exist and most of the time were right.

Lenny (00:59:46):
So what is it for you that you said was your superpower and your shadow?

Nikhyl Singhal (00:59:50):
I think that I was, as an entrepreneur, very opinionated about using small amounts of information to make decisions. And then I was very good at driving those things. So when you become an entrepreneur, you're great at grit, you're great at opinion, you're great at being decisive. And then as an executive, you spend a lot of time making sure everyone has context, everyone is heard, your opinions are actually edited for good reason. And it's not just to placate, it's actually to improve. But as someone who's basically been right a lot, that requires almost a complete and you're like, "Well, that's not who I am." And I'm like, "Okay, you start with the sentence like that's not who I am." You're definitely doing it right when you hit your leadership.

Lenny (01:00:40):
What was the process like for you to work through that? You said it took a long time. What made it effective for you? Was there a coach involved? Something else?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:00:49):
I got a lot of setback. I get a lot of negative feedback. I had a lot of abrupt challenges at work where folks would say, "You're not collaborating well. Your peers don't have the same level of respect as they should." And I was like, "Are you kidding me? That's not who I am. These things that are being said about are completely ironic." I was very much struggling and that's when I said, "You know what? I can struggle and blame others, but what if they were right? I'm going to be doing this for 30 more years, it's kind of worth it to figure out if they're right. If they're wrong, then you don't lose." And that's what kind of forced it. And then the tooling starts, then you start talking through. My self-awareness was strong enough that I was able to say, "Okay, now I understand it." I had some peer feedback that helped bring it home from someone I trusted. So that was a kind of linchpin to this, but these are tough, tough things to break through. And oftentimes they don't come nicely, I guess, is the point.

Lenny (01:01:53):
I was going to ask what that turning point for you was, and it sounds like it was direct feedback from someone you really trusted that's like, "Oh, I really need to take this seriously."

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:01):
You got it. You got it. Because I had a lot of feedback that I was dismissing and then I had feedback from someone, I'm like, "That person I should listen to because they're giving me the feedback for the right reasons and they have the right language."

Lenny (01:02:13):
Comes back to the power of getting feedback and getting good at that.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:17):
And making people feel safe and giving it.

Lenny (01:02:19):
Mm-hmm. That's a good segue to maybe the last question. You told me once that a lot of the people that you work with that have kind of made it have a lot of mental health challenges, that they didn't expect their life to be the way it is necessarily when they got there. Can you just talk about what you see there in that group?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:02:39):
Yeah. This is a story that I don't think is told very well right now, and partly because it's such a luxury problem, it's almost a little embarrassing to discuss it openly as so many people struggle with so many basic needs, going through layoffs, going through all these challenges. I mean, these are real issues. But I think that what I've noticed is that if you kind of break career as we've done in this podcast between sort of act one, act two and act three, if act one is sort of learning and being that sort of builder and then maybe building the car, and then act two is building the factory, act three is like, what's after that? What do you do after that? And I think that act three in the past wasn't as long as it is now. Before, people would proverbially retire in their 60s when they used to actually physically work.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:03:35):
Now almost all your listeners sit at a desk all day, so they don't need to retire by any means. And health is getting better. You might see folks work until their 70s or 80s. So that means that their careers are potentially 60 years long. So even if you're 20 years or 30 years in your career, you're only halfway through. So this act three could be a thing. And I don't think we talk about act three enough. What often happens is, and this is what I've been watching for people that are at my age, is they sort of succeed and then they become lost. They almost goes hand in hand.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:04:14):
So when I was a kid and I was growing up in the Midwest, entertainment was going to the dog tracks, and not even the horse tracks, we didn't have horses. So it was the greyhound dog tracks. So people would bet on a dog and greyhound would go around the ring and then you would see. I bet on number three and I'll make a buck or something. The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these fake rabbits, which sounds kind of cruel and horrible, so I don't want the SPCA to come after you. But the point is that they'd have these fake rabbits. And what was interesting is, the moment that the dogs, if they accidentally touched the rabbit, the sort of the tail because the machine broke, because these tails would go around faster than the dogs, which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles. Sometimes the machines would break, the dogs would actually catch the rabbit, they would never run again.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:05:17):
The reason why they wouldn't run again is because there was like, "Well, what's next? I've achieved what I was looking for." So I think this happens a ton. It's like, your listeners are spending time focused on like, "Well, one day I will be X. I will be that vice president. I will have more money. I will have built something. I will have started a company." But they don't think about what happens next, and when it happens, when they succeed, their North Star, their entire way of wiring their career, themselves, it has been around getting to that place. And I think that if you're going to get there 30 years in and you have a 60-year career, a lot of the discussion I've been having with myself and with others has been, you probably need to start working on that North Star now.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:06:08):
What's the second thing? What's your career next look like? How do you ensure that you are always going to have something important and motivating to do with your career? Otherwise, you'll keep working because you had no nothing else to do, but you'll be sadder, or you'll find ways to create war when peace is needed, or you'll spend money in an attempt to earn more, or you'll find habits that are bad. And I really want us to have long 60-year, 70-year careers, not just 30-year or 10-year, which is why I enter this into the vocabulary out there.

Lenny (01:06:51):
That is really resonating with me. I had a similar experience. I had a startup, and my whole goal was just like, "I just want to start a company." That's my goal. That's all I got in life. I want to start a company and then maybe sell it, maybe go somewhere with it. So I did and then we sold it to Airbnb and then I got to Airbnb and I was just like, "What the hell do I do now? I don't have any other goals." And it was pretty sad. Exactly how you're describing. It was just like, "I guess I'll just work here and I don't know, maybe I'll start another company, but I already did the thing I wanted to do."

Nikhyl Singhal (01:07:21):
Your story is I think very inspiring because what you did is you said, "I think the thing that I want to do is give, but I want to do it in my own way and I want to create something, but I want to do something that I think I can do for 30 years and I want to do it." It has lots and lots of spokes to it. So you reinvented yourself professionally, but you created a new North Star.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:07:48):
My sense is, for every one of you, Lenny, there's a hundred that could do that, that could do giving, that could do things that could scale, but that end up falling into what got them to be successful in act two and they get stuck. So this is the reason why when you hit your skip, keep looking for the next skip, is the point I'm trying to make. And I think you're an inspiration for a lot of folks who have seen you transition and realizes life after just being a tech professional entrepreneur, there's got to be ways to do more of this for all of your listeners. And I think it's never too early to start thinking through. It's actually quite powering to think that you have such a long career. You can make mistakes and you can do some amazing things down the road.

Lenny (01:08:34):
Yeah. This is my fourth career, is what I realized. I was a engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, and now whatever this is.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:08:43):
Whatever this is.

Lenny (01:08:45):
Whatever this is. I guess, just to give people something inspiring, productive, what are maybe some examples of North Stars you've seen that people can evolve into? I guess one path is this path of content creation, helping people learn stuff. What else have you seen that might work out for people?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:09:00):
I think that all variations here come into two categories. One categories are ways to drive more scaled economics. I've made millions. My North Star is to now make it tens. I've made tens. My North star is to do hundreds. That's what drives people from, it's not entrepreneurship, it's investing; it's not investing, it's private equity, et cetera. Whether we describe that as a bad quest or a good quest is a decision for your listener. The other arc is around giving. Eastern philosophies that have been around for thousands of years talk about this as the sort of end state of happiness. I think that maybe to be provocative, I think that it's okay for you in act one and act two to not predicate yourself around the notion of giving to others because this is maybe the time on the planet where you need to take and you need to create.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:10:11):
But boy, if you're going to work on an act three and you have 30 years, regardless of where you are economically, if you feel like you can take that off the table, if you can find ways to give, whatever that means to you, however that translates to you, is that content, is that volunteer, is that starting a company that is more mission based, that is not my role, but I think that if you are able to do that for 30 years and be giving, not only is that going to be more fulfilling than your act one and act two, but it's tremendous for society, very empowering. And that's where I commend you because you're giving through your passion but also making a livelihood. And I think that that's a very powerful blend that is hard to achieve in act one and act two given constraints. And that's the liberation that act three provides.

Lenny (01:11:08):
What do you think your act three plus ends up being?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:11:12):
Many have asked me about this. I would say that I'll use the word, and then I'll tell you I won't use that word. So it is around my passion around coaching and giving to others. But because I'm a product person, because I've seen success in building products, thinking about scale, thinking about community, I definitively plan to devote my act three towards coaching and giving to others and lifting up those that with the right advice at the right time can change their trajectory. But scaling that and doing that in a way that is very authentic is really the hardest part and it's product problem. So that's what I'll devote 30 years to and I look forward to that every day.

Lenny (01:11:59):
That is beautiful. That feels like an exactly correct fit for you, and I'm here to help you on that journey any way I can.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:05):
Thank you, my friend.

Lenny (01:12:06):
Absolutely. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:11):
No, I just appreciate your genuine offer to have me attend and participate in this wonderful podcast that you created.

Lenny (01:12:18):
It's absolutely my pleasure. And it's not over yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:25):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:12:26):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:12:30):
So two, and both business books. Sorry, I'm going to come across boring. But one is this sort of little bit of an old school book called Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. I don't know if other speakers have spoken about this, but it's a book that Geoffrey Moore wrote, and it's a book that really talks about how to get your first product on base. So it's this concept of creating a beachhead. I like that concept. Marketing is something that we don't talk about in enough and product.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:13:02):
And then the second one is a book that none of your listeners have actually probably heard of called Leadership and Self-Deception. It's a six-hour audio that I highly recommend. It's a story about a person who has hit a wall and who's getting all this feedback that they don't know what to make of, and it's around their mindset being stuck in a box. That was very powerful when I listened to it in my late 20s. So I encourage all of your listeners to grab that one. It's not one that anyone normally would hit, but it's a fun story. It's a good ride, and I think maybe you'll get something out of it.

Lenny (01:13:41):
I have not heard of that second one. I'm excited to check it out. I have Crossing the Chasm back behind me on that shelf somewhere. And you talk about how marketing isn't something product leaders and managers think about enough, and I have many marketing-oriented guests on this podcast and those episodes do the least well, but I'm just going to keep doing it because I totally agree with you. I think there's so much to learn from marketing. It's connected to growth, which is connected to product. So I agree.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:14:07):
Yeah, and I think that marketing is a language of connecting products with people. That is what a product manager does, but we often lack the language. We lack the thinking around how to explain it, and yet we spend all our time on data and features for that. The diversity of having both playbooks can make one of just a much more powerful builder. So I agree with you. Marketing folks is probably some of the best content and the least listen to. So maybe that's a plug for people to go back to those episodes.

Lenny (01:14:39):
100%. That's what everyone should do. I don't know if you know this, but actually, at Airbnb, the product manager function has been renamed to product marketing. So all the product managers are product marketers because Brian is so big on, you're not just building product, your job is also to make sure people use it. We'll see how that experiment goes, but that's a bold move I thought.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:14:59):
Very much so. Very much. But it's an homage to this concept.

Lenny (01:15:02):
Exactly. Okay, back to landing ground. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:15:08):
I'm a huge sports fan, so I have tickets to the Warriors and 49ers, and I am a big Bay Area sports fan. Giannis is my son's favorite player. He's a basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks, and they have this Disney+ story called the Rise story, and it's a story about his childhood and how he struggled to find notoriety and how he made it into the professional leagues. It's a great Disney+ family show and it's a great kind of zero to hero type thing. So I love that story.

Lenny (01:15:41):
I feel like you're going to have a really good answer to this next one. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:15:47):
I like the format of, what's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate? Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career, what's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you can do that for what do people think about AI, that's inaccurate, that everyone believes you could do that for domains, you can do all kinds of things.

Lenny (01:16:18):
I love it. Is there something you specifically look for there, or is it just depends on what you hear?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:16:25):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. And as a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss because they weren't genuine. There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated because it starts with, "What is the thing that you think I want to say here? And then tell me why it's inaccurate." So when I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new, but I don't want the interview process to penalize them. And this was my save question, but I can't use it now that I've told everyone.

Lenny (01:17:27):
It's going to be all over TikTok soon. Everyone's going to know this. Next question, what's a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:17:35):
The geeky answer in me is the Arc Browser, which I think probably a lot of folks are starting to use and your listeners. Part of the reason is, I think it's just great for folks that have hundreds of tabs, and if you work at a scaled organization, you just have lots of tabs. But I think it's also, as a product guy, I thought Chrome was pretty good. They've got gajillions of people using it and billions of installs. So at some point, you kind of come to the conclusion that this is probably good enough. And then you see a product obviously built with a much smaller team and you're like, "Huh, there actually is opportunities to innovate." And any time you see a innovation on something that's mature, as a product person, I think that's just fascinating. And I was just blown away at how they created something that's better than something I hold as a true set.

Lenny (01:18:33):
Yeah. We had Josh on the podcast, we talked about a lot of their philosophies. And on the tab thing, I think the key there is it closes your tabs after 24 hours unless you put them in a specific place, which I love because I was like, you think you would do that, but you don't. And then it's broke so beautiful, you wake up in the morning, everything's gone, but you can save stuff that you want. The other thing I'll mention with Arc, by the way, also huge fan, that's all I use, and I'm not an investor, just a fan, is the onboarding experience is the best onboarding experience I've seen. I was just like, I did it and I got a tweet about this. This is so good. And actually, if you go to that episode, there's a link to get past the wait list and just-

Nikhyl Singhal (01:19:11):
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:12):
Yeah. You gave me many thousands of invites. Okay, keep going. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you develop products and your team that's had a big impact on the team's ability to execute?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:19:26):
A little bit of this is just because of scale, but oftentimes we think a lot about the products and the features and the decisions that we're working on, and then we think that meetings are a nuisance or a must-have necessary evil to be able to deliver. Sometimes I realize that at a scaled organization, the meeting operating system is as important as the products that we're building because it sort of speaks to how we scale and how we ensure we have the right degree of delegation, the right conversations, and then the right acceleration on the right decisions.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:20:11):
So what's interesting is every quarter, in my current teams, even in my past teams, I talk about our meetings like a product. We're on version seven in my team, and so we're like, "Hey, version seven, every 90 days, these are the meetings, these are the discussions, this is how we organize, these are the attendees, and then here's how we make decisions. This is the cadence of the week. This is when people can work from home, hybrid, whatever it might be." And then I take feedback two months in and then every three months we make another route.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:20:44):
What it finds is that people then can plan and they can make meeting time effective. And meeting time is such precious time. It's the most expensive time in a company. So when I was in a startup, I couldn't imagine doing this, but now this is like my bread and butter as a leader. It's the process part. And frankly, for new folks that are new in leadership positions in a new company, it's the one thing you can do when you have low context. When you don't know how the product works, you can look at things with fresh eyes and see inefficiencies when everyone that's been in the system can't see it. I'm a huge fan of rebooting meetings first. So process first, then people, then product, then strategy is sort of the notion I make, and this is this first thing I always do.

Lenny (01:21:29):
Final question, what is one thing every PM listening should do to help their career?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:21:35):
Ensure that the story you will tell about the work you're doing today is meaningful for your skip job. So if you sit down and you write down, "In six months, in 12 months, in 24 months, when I achieve or finish this role, here's the paragraph I'll write. Here's a problem I solved. Here's the skill I built. Here's the headwind I faced. Here's what I did to overcome it." Use I in the sentence, do not use we. We will do good things. You are who we are thinking about, your career. We're not looking for we. Master the story now. Understand the story. If the story sucks, you probably should be thinking through how to make the story not suck. But that to me is a very good career decision and I think everyone is building their story today. I want to know that story. I want that story to be incredibly compelling because whether you promote it or not, that story's compelling. You'll be promoted in career. And that's what we're here for.

Lenny (01:22:48):
Nikhyl, this is the first time we've ever met. I'm such a fan instantly. This might be my new favorite episode. I'm so excited for people to listen to this. There's so much value here. Two final questions before we wrap up. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more? And also, talk about maybe various community, The Skip, and all that stuff that people can check out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:23:09):
I'm building this brand around The Skip because I'm so passionate. There's two outlets that people can easily connect. One is the podcast, which much like yourselves is available on Apple and Spotify and others. So I'd love for people to join my podcast and hear. What I'm now moving my podcast to is almost like coaching calls. Because I have so many of them, I'm saying like, "Hey, 30 minutes, let me walk you through a problem and hear how I'm thinking about it, whether that's a transition discussion or compensation discussion, et cetera." And then the other one is this sort of newsletter that I have on Substack, which is a bit of a mirror of the podcast. It's different forms of the same topic areas. So, would love for your listeners to connect with that.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:23:54):
I think as far as getting in touch with me, LinkedIn is where I spend most of my time professionally. So between Twitter and LinkedIn, my presence is relatively easy to find. And then how listeners can help me, I mean, one, you can build the most fulfilling career story and be your best, but also give back and pull others forward. Whether that's through your act three or whether that's just helping others, I mean, I think that would be the most fulfilling to me. I think feedback from your listeners to me on things they wish I would spend time talking about is incredibly empowering for my content because then I can deliver more meaningful content. It's very different from yours, but I think it's all around the arc of trying to help people gain forward and be more effective tech professionals. So I would love to hear from your listeners.

Lenny (01:24:48):
Just to make sure people know where to go to do this. For feedback, do you recommend LinkedIn?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:24:53):
Yeah, LinkedIn is the ideal, but you can also find me on Twitter if you are just trying to add a quick... If you're trying to follow me, follow me on LinkedIn. If you're looking for feedback, just tweet me.

Lenny (01:25:03):
And then for The Skip newsletter, what is the URL to go check that out?

Nikhyl Singhal (01:25:06):
It's theskip.substack.com.

Lenny (01:25:09):
Amazing. And you don't publish often, but each issue is incredibly valuable, so we'll definitely link to that all in the show notes. Nikhyl, thank you again so much for being here. I will let you go now. This was amazing.

Nikhyl Singhal (01:25:21):
Yeah, thank you, Lenny. Appreciate it.

Lenny (01:25:23):
Bye, everyone.

## Transcript

Nikita Bier (00:00:00):
... Honored to be on a product management podcast for a person who doesn't believe product management is real.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
We're already getting into the hot takes. You launched tbh, went viral, you end up selling it to Facebook. What was the insight that helped you come up with this is a big idea that we should try?

Nikita Bier (00:00:15):
I looked on the App Store and the number one app in the United States was an app called Surah, but the entire app was in Arabic, like the strongest signal that you could ever have that people want something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
This is insane. I did not know this full story.

Nikita Bier (00:00:30):
We launched this app, it immediately took off, servers started crashing. I looked at our numbers and I'm like, "We will be number one in the United States in six days."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
A tip that you're sharing here is look for latent demand

Nikita Bier (00:00:43):
Where people are trying to obtain a particular value and going through a very distortive process. If you can actually crystallize what their motivation is, you can have this kind of intense adoption.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
I didn't know you're actually a product manager at Facebook.

Nikita Bier (00:00:59):
The thing I didn't realize as a product manager in a large tech company is there is very little product management that you do. They're mainly just writing documents and then being the team secretary and running around getting approvals, but products live and die in the pixels. You should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything. That's on you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):
At some point you started tweeting like, "Hey, I'm working on new app. Everyone was going nuts." I saw a stat that you made $11 million in sales, 10 million downloads.

Nikita Bier (00:01:28):
The thing that is hard to really understand is it is absolute chaos to keep the thing online. I was sleeping three hours a day for three months. Our team was also relentless though. They would come over to my house, 9:00 AM, stay until midnight and just do that seven days a week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:44):
Is there anything else that's just like this is something that is probably going to help you with your app?

Nikita Bier (00:01:48):
With certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):
Today, my guest is Nikita Bier. Nikita has built, launched and helped get more apps to the top of the app store than any human I've ever come across. He sold his first big hit tbh to Facebook for over $30 million. He sold his second big app Gas to Discord for many millions more. He did this all with a tiny team and very little funding. He's also helped dozens of founders and apps, and as an advisor or investor to companies like Flow, Citizen, BeReal, LOCKit and Wealthsimple and many more. Today, he spends his time advising companies on viral growth strategies, design feedback, structuring their product development process and a lot more.

(00:02:38):
What I love about Nikita is that he has very strong opinions about how to build successful products that are rooted in him actually doing the work over the past decade to see for himself what works and what doesn't. Nikita has been the single most requested guests on this podcast, and you'll soon see why. This episode is packed with tactics and stories and lessons that I am sure will leave you wanting more. If you want to work with Nikita on your app, you can actually book his time at intro.co/nikitabier. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Nikita Bier. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Nikita Bier (00:03:26):
Thanks for having me. I'm excited to dive in. I feel honored to be on a product management podcast for a person who doesn't believe product management is real.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:38):
We're already getting into the hot takes. We're definitely going to chat about... Wait, and you said not real. Okay, I thought you were going to say not useful. This is good. Let's put a pin in that. I think we think this, I think everyone already feels this. I think this is going to be a very special conversation. I've been looking forward to chatting you for a long time and there's so much that I want to ask you. The way that I'm thinking we frame this conversation is we go through the story behind the apps that you've built or helped build that have hit the top of the app store, and basically here, the inside story of what it took to build those apps and to make them successful. Then through that, try to extract as many lessons as we can about what it takes to build a successful viral consumer app these days. How does that sound to you?

Nikita Bier (00:04:22):
Sounds amazing, and a lot of it was luck, but a lot of it was very, very tactical work that went into it all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):

That's vanta.com/lenny. First, I want to start with something that I think very few people know about you. The first thing that you built, the first product that you built was very different from what you do these days, and it's a product called Politify, which something I actually really want. It helps you decide who to vote for based on how it would impact your life. Can you just share a bit about just that part of your life and why you decided to pivot away from that into consumer apps?

Nikita Bier (00:06:36):
When I was in college, I was really interested in this kind of thing that American voters do, which is they vote against their own financial self-interest, like people in New York and San Francisco vote for Democrats for higher taxes. People in Kansas vote for Republicans for low taxes and they make less money, and so fewer government benefits. I wanted to build this tool that would help communicate the financial impacts of these policy proposals of presidents. I built it in my last year of college and it was just a web app that we put out and it would calculate their tax proposals, the government benefits that they were proposing, and you would enter in your basic personal information, how many kids you have, your age. Then it would just tell you in dollars what the impact would be. It'd also tell you, we simulated those policies also against the tax returns of every zip code so you could see how it impacts your community.

(00:07:40):
We went super viral. I think very few people thought of politics that way and I think we got 4 million users on it during that season, during that election. It was just like a project that we raised some grant money for, but it ended up feeding into this company that we spun up and that was called Outline. Because we had a bunch of governments reach out to us asking, "Can you build this for our budget?" The governor of Massachusetts actually reached out and I flew out there to meet with them and that was going to be our first customer. We raised some money, we won a government contract and we joined Techstars, the accelerator. We got a contract in the pipeline with the Obama administration and then we got this contract and we started building it and the government shutdown happened in the middle of like, as we were building it and we had one of our contracts canceled.

(00:08:51):
I realized I actually really don't like selling software to governments and my core competency all along was making things that go viral on the internet. That was what we had built, not this policy simulation tool. We went to our investors and we said, "Look, this isn't actually what we're excited about doing anymore." We offered to give the money back and said, "We're going to be building consumer apps and here's a few ideas that we have." None of them took the money back. Then we spent the next four or five years building a variety of different kind of consumer apps. We had a few mild successes during the course of those four to five years. One of them was an app called Five Labs that ingested your Facebook posts and determine your personality based on the language you use. It used this exact same model that Cambridge Analytica used, and that was super viral. I think we had tens of millions of profiles in it and it went viral in like three days.

(00:10:09):
We raised some more money based off the success of that and we started focusing a lot more on mobile after that first app, Five Labs. We launched basically every type of app you can imagine. We launched mapping apps, chat apps, event meetup apps. Basically, every consumer app on mobile that you could think of. That actually helped us build a muscle to understand what people want and how to actually make things grow and how to test them. Over time, we started focusing more on teens. A lot of people ask why Silicon Valley is so fixated on building apps for teens.

(00:10:55):
One of the reasons is their habits are pretty malleable. As we get older, we get fixed into our habits of using certain communication products and we don't really adopt new things. Then the other thing that we discovered was that adults don't really invite people to new apps. We found that as a user got older from age 13 to 18, the number of people that they invite to an app just declines almost exponentially. Finally, and the most important thing is they see each other every day, and that is so critical. Consumer app developers sometimes say smokers are great for targeting an audience because they actually hang out serendipitously a lot outside of buildings. Not to say social apps are cigarettes, I don't really like that metaphor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:50):
Just on the note of you talking about why teens are important, I have this quote actually from you that I love where building on the point you made that for every social app I've ever built and the number of invitations sent per user drops 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18. If you build for adults, expect to acquire every user with ads, and I love that you have a very clear heuristic of per year, the amount of people they invite to the app is 20% lower.

Nikita Bier (00:12:18):
If your users aren't inviting people to your app, you're going to have to find another way to acquire them, and that most likely means ads. If you're targeting older cohorts like adults, you're going to have to raise a huge amount of venture capital to finance that user acquisition pipeline and it's going to be extraordinarily expensive. As a seed stage up, it's going to be basically impossible to grow that user base, especially to get density if you need actual network effects among users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:56):
Basically, you're building this help me decide who to vote for app that turned into a real business with government contracts coming to you trying to help you, pushing you to build something that you end up realizing I don't want to be doing this. Why am I building this app selling government contracts. What you did is you, and this is a really interesting lesson to take away, is you just realized, I don't want to be doing this. Investors don't force me to be working on this. I'm going to stop this. I'm going to go work on some other stuff that I'm actually excited about that I think has a bigger chance of success. That's where you transition to this startup studio where you're just trying a bunch of apps and I think it was called Midnight Labs, you said, something like that, right?

Nikita Bier (00:13:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):
Awesome. Basically, I think that's a really interesting insight of just like if you're working on something you don't enjoy, you can change that, you can pivot, you can tell your investors I want to work on something else. Is there anything there that you want to add along those lines?

Nikita Bier (00:13:49):
It was really hard for us to pivot to mobile. I think that was one of the most challenging things for me personally because it was a completely different paradigm. I actually have been building web apps since I was 12 years old. I built a full e-commerce business selling pirated games on the web, and I knew everything about growing a website. As we pivoted to mobile, I had to recalibrate my whole brain on how to do that. Mobile apps have such a low margin for error when it comes to designing them. Because I have this dogmatic view that every tap on a mobile app is a miracle for you as a product developer because users will turn and bounce to their next app very quickly.

(00:14:46):
If you actually sit behind someone and watch them use their phone, they actually switch between apps at a pretty high frequency. Every tap that you get, every single one is so scarce that you should be optimizing everything. I had to change my whole brain when we started pivoting to mobile and building these mobile apps, and it took a lot of failures. 14 of the apps that we launched were basically duds, and then we started fixating on teens and building apps for them. Eventually, we figured out an interesting heuristic for identifying consumer product opportunities that ultimately led us to tbh.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:27):
You spent four or five years trying a bunch of different ideas. I think people see this headline and we'll get into tbh of just like nine weeks after launch sells for $30 million to Facebook and everyone's like, "Oh, okay, that's amazing. I want that for my life." Nobody knows there's this four or five years of trying, you said 15 different apps before you got there, learning the things that actually work and don't work.

Nikita Bier (00:15:49):
We built 15 apps over the course of that pivot to consumer, and we built apps for every single app, map apps, chat apps, to-do lists. We just built every type of consumer app you could possibly think of. Also, we built for every audience too. We built for college students, we built for post-college. It was always very difficult to get the flywheel spinning for anyone after like 22 years old. That was the cutoff of when people just give up on adopting new products. It took us a few years to really internalize that, a lot of failures to realize no one needs another app after that age.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):
The thing that you found there, which is really interesting because most people are building for people older than 22, that's a profound insight you had there. Every consumer app I see is trying to build for adults, and your lesson there is basically if you're trying to do that, you're probably going to need to raise money and spend a lot of money on paid ads.

Nikita Bier (00:17:04):
Most likely, you'll never get network effects. There's actually an interesting study many years ago that some academics in Spain did, I think it was in Spain, and they looked at how many people you text per year of your life, and it goes up very quickly from 14 to 18. It peaks around 21, so it's growing. The number of people you text is growing up until about 21, and then it just falls, it collapses, and then it comes back up at end of life. There's a few reasons all this happens, but basically, once you exit college, you reduce the number of contacts, your daily contacts.

(00:17:48):
Once you get married, it's even fewer. Then as you get older and your kids start having kids and you become a grandparent, you start texting again more or you join a retirement home. If you're building a product with network effects that's a communication tool, you want to be on that upward curve of adding connections to your social graph because then the urgency to connect is higher. If you really want to actually innovate at the edges of communication products, you really have to target that cohort that has the highest urgency to communicate, and that's teens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):
I love that you found these things out, not through just research and not through just thinking, it was through actual trying things over and over and over and trying different audiences, trying different experiences. A lot of people see your advice and they're like, "How does he know?" It's just you've done all these things yourself. You've seen them, you're sitting there watching teens use these apps. I think very few people actually do that, and they just come up with these theories that aren't based in empirical evidence.

Nikita Bier (00:18:55):
We got pretty good at building these apps. I think our first mobile app took us about a year, and then our last one took us about two weeks. We also got very good at testing apps. The most important thing that I often instruct teams to do is to develop a reproducible testing process, and that will actually influence the probability of your success more than anything. It's so unpredictable whether a consumer product idea will work. If you actually focus more on your process for taking many shots at bat, that's what actually reduces the risk more than anything. We figured out ways to seed apps into schools. We also, during the course of that company, we figured out how to seed it into affinity groups, hobbyists, things like that. We were on app number 15, a lot of failures during the course of this company, and I remember a lot of our team members were like, "I kind of want to leave. I think this is it for me."

(00:20:08):
One of our key team members actually put in their two weeks' notice. The day before we launched our final app, we were getting kind of low on money. I was tired. I called our lawyer to ask, how do you dissolve a company? I messaged a few mentors saying like, one people that have been through it, and I said, "What are the steps to do this?" Then I had a conversation on the way out with that team member that wanted to leave, and I said, "I understand, but what if the app actually starts charting on the App Store?" He said, "What are the chances of that? You know that's not going to happen." I said, "Sure, okay." We launched this app and it was a polling app, tbh, and it immediately took off in the school that we seeded it into, in Georgia. We picked the one school that had the earliest start date in the United States because we needed to launch as soon as possible, given the state of the company.

(00:21:26):
I think it spread to 40% of the school downloaded it in the first 24 hours and it rapidly spread to the neighboring schools. Suddenly, I was like, "Oh, we might have something here." Servers started crashing and watching it climb the charts. I looked at our numbers and I'm like, "We will be number one in the United States in six days." Then I looked at our Amazon bill and it was like 120,000. I looked at our bank account, it said 150,000. I'm like, "Okay, these two numbers don't really..." I quickly had to put together a funding round and I told my team, "Can you guys just pause for two months and just really focus on this? I think I could probably sell this thing." It turned into a pretty competitive bidding process, actually. There was a really, really great moment where there was one of the acquirers, or one of the bidders was based in LA, had told me to fly down, and they told me to fly down that day.

(00:22:40):
I got on a plane, went to the airport without a ticket, showed up. When we were rolling out this app, we were doing a state-by-state rollout strategy where every state was geo-fenced. We hadn't launched California until that morning. I arrived at this company, this founders in LA's house, and he said, "Show me the metrics. You guys are like, what? Number four or something?" Since we just launched California, it's a big state. I said, "No, we're actually number one. We're the number one app in the United States." He said, "Show me the metrics." Our CTO, Erik Hazzard, is a published author in mapping. He created an amazing dashboard that could show real-time installs on a map. It was around 4:00 PM and school had just gotten out, so I zoomed in on the block that we were having that meeting, and the entire block was lit up with installs all around us. Then that's what got the ball rolling on a... It was a really, really like, cinematic moment of showing something that you created that literally just took over the entire neighborhood around you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
That's insane. That's going to be in the movie of Nikita Bier in the future. A couple of questions here. One, you predicted the chart, you would hit number one. What does it take to hit number one? What is the number you're looking at? Is it some number downloads to get to number one in the App Store?

Nikita Bier (00:24:17):
It fluctuates. It used to be like 80 to 100,000 installs, but now you have these companies that are just spending extraordinary amounts on ads and or injecting it into one of their other apps. Between Threads, Temu and all these other apps that are spending on acquisition and all that, some days it's up to 300,000.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
That's per day?

Nikita Bier (00:24:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:42):
Oh, man. Amazing.

Nikita Bier (00:24:43):
At the peak of tbh, we were getting 360,000 per day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:50):
The other two things I want to spend a little time on here before we move on to the next app is, what was the insight that helped you come up with this is a big idea that we should try? Then what was the insight into how to spread this so virally? I know that one is really close.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
... to how to spread this so virally, and I know that one is really clever.

Nikita Bier (00:25:04):
After building all these apps, we had these kind of lingering users that stuck around and would share feedback with us on our next app. And so there were a couple, like there's a senior in high school that I would send screenshots of our products. He told me about this trend called TBH that kids were playing on Snapchat, where they would post an image of a bunch of emojis and it would say like, "I like you. Your smart. Your style is great." And you would just reply to the story with the emoji of what you felt. And I was like, "This is kind of weird. You post this on your story and then people send you feedback." And I'm like, "So teens are looking for this vehicle for disclosure essentially." And I'm like, "That's kind of cool. I wonder if you could make that into an app." We had sketched some things out. As we were sketching things out, I looked on the app store, and the number one app in the United States was an app called Sarahah. It was for sending anonymous messages by adding a link to your Snapchat story.

(00:26:17):
But the thing that was most interesting was the entire app was in Arabic. The number one app in the United States was in Arabic. And that was one of the most strongest signal that you could ever have that people want something. And so when I meet with founders, I often tell them like, "The way you should be searching for product ideas is this concept of latent demand where people are trying to obtain a particular value and going through a very distortive process to obtain that value." And if you can actually crystallize what their motivation is and build a product around and clear up what they're trying to actually do, you can have this kind of intense adoption.

(00:27:11):
When we saw what people were doing with Sarahah, I also looked at some of the tweets and comments on it. A lot of people were receiving negative messages. And so what I saw with the game that kids were playing on Snapchat TBH and then Sarahah, I realized just people want to know good things about themselves and that they don't want these bullying messages that they're getting on these anonymous apps, and I was like, "Well, what if instead of actually typing what you wanted to say about somebody, you just answered polls and we authored those polls so that we ensured everything would always be positive?"

(00:27:51):
I mean, in the back of my head, I always knew anonymous apps go viral, but they always lead to these awful news stories of kids committing suicide, self-harm and all that. And so I was like, "I'll never build anything like that." But when we came up with this new mechanic where you could only say positive things through polls, who has the best smile, who's most likely to be president, and then you receive it as anonymous, but your name is selected, what we discovered a couple of things is it made users feel a lot better. It actually solved what they were trying to do and they also sent a much higher volume of messages. And so it was literally explosive adoption.

(00:28:35):
One school I was looking at, they sent 450,000 messages in the first seven days of adopting it. And when you look at day one volume of messages sent on a messaging app, you're lucky if people send three or four or something, but we were sending 60 and we couldn't even handle it, so we had to geofence the app because we needed to scale our servers, which is actually a pretty controversial decision inside of our company, because why would you turn off something that's working? But at my core, I knew if it's working at this many individual schools, we could just relaunch it any time and it'll go viral. So let's regroup and figure out what's happening here and then relaunch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
So you keep talking about how went viral and crazy, grew like crazy. I know that there's a little trick that you came up with to help it spread. Can you just briefly talk about what you did there and to help it spread so quickly within a school?

Nikita Bier (00:29:37):
I think you're referring to, there's a memo that was leaked to BuzzFeed while I was at Facebook. The main thing we found was like, to be convinced to download an app, you need to see it. You need to see the marketing message three times or so. So you basically need to saturate an area with every kind of marketing you can. So we ran ads targeted at a particular school to when we were seeding and testing these apps. And we also followed people creating a dedicated Instagram account that went to that school, because we learned that high schoolers identify their school in their bio, so it says RHS on their bio. And so that was how we tried to get the entire school to adopt synchronously. We'd follow them and then accept the followbacks.

(00:30:36):
Big misunderstanding though, and I get this DM a lot of people are like, "I'm trying to replicate your strategy. We've just done it at 15 schools and it's not working anymore." This is not the way we grew the app. This is how we tested apps. Really, it's a little bit nuanced there. That's an important nuance because you need to get enough intensity of adoption and density for a social network to start to get the flywheel spinning, but the app should grow by itself after that. And people think we just went from school to school following every kid on it. You can't, that's totally unrealistic. But for the first 100 users, yes, that's how we got them. And that allowed us to know whether the product was working or not. We could get enough people on it and then we could, with conviction, say that whether the app had legs and we wouldn't have this kind of uncertainty like, "Oh, did they add enough friends? Did we get enough people on it? Did they reach the aha moment because you need friends to get on?"

(00:31:41):
So we wanted to eliminate that confounding variable, and so we figured out a way to just get a bunch of people to adopt at once. And that's one thing I encourage a lot of founders to do, is figure out a way to eliminate all those potentially confounding variables so you can know immediately whether something's working or not. You never want to walk away from an experiment or test and say, "Well, maybe the execution was bad because it takes a lot of energy to mobilize a team to test something," and you really want to make sure your tests actually provide signal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:18):
So your advice here is when you're testing something, test the best possible version of what that could be, whether it takes manual work or something that is never going to scale, test the ideal. Because that'll tell you, " Even if this could be the best possible version, do people actually care?"

Nikita Bier (00:32:34):
Yeah, we would try to get an entire school to adopt, just to know if everyone had 10 friends, would they actually derive value from this app? We also did other things, and I recommend all companies do this, is put live chat customer support in your app 24 hours a day. It sounds insane. It's like the whole point of tech is you don't need to do that. That's the whole point of a software. But then users get this white glove experience, and that eliminates another confounding variable, like did they think their problems were solved or they were treated well? But most of all, one of the reasons I actually recommend people put live chat in their app is it's the best vehicle for getting feedback and doing user research because users will literally tell you the problem they're having. So we had our person that was running this. He's name is Michael Gutierrez. He's done it for all my companies actually. He's the community and customer support rep. He would paste any interesting feedback into Slack and then we would be like, "Oh, this user has a great idea. We should consider turning that into a feature." So you really want your finger on the pulse as you roll these things out so you can get a sense for what's working, what isn't, and also make users feel great and make sure at the end they promote your app positively to their peers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:09):
I love that piece of advice.

(00:34:11):
Okay, so to close out the TBH chapter, is there anything else that you think is important for people to know or any other lasting lessons from that part of your journey that you bring with you to new apps that you're building today?

Nikita Bier (00:34:25):
I think the thing that is hard to really understand for first-time founders that hit breakout success with a consumer product is how draining and how spread thin you get, because everything breaks. Everything that you built needs to be substituted almost every three days.

(00:34:52):
I can just give you an example. We were just talking about this customer support system that we had. The first system broke after three days. The next one broke seven days later, we had to replace it with a different one that could scale even better. And if you think about that on every dimension of the company, it is absolute chaos to keep the thing online as it scales up. And so you have to be ruthless with prioritization as something scales up and put out the largest fires first, because that was something that I didn't really fully understand, is how many things go wrong. And if we didn't geofence the app, there would be no way we would've been able to keep that thing online because that gave us some slack to control growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:55):
This is a good example of when people ask like, "Hey, does my app have product-market fit?" I think this is an example of this is what it looks like when things are breaking every three days when you have to geofence it to keep it from crashing.

Nikita Bier (00:36:06):
A lot of people ask me like, "What's the benchmark for product-market fit?" And this founder that I'm friends with, his name's Roger Dickey, he told me this one time, "If your product's working, you'll know. And if there's any uncertainty, it's not working." And it really is a binary when it comes to consumer products. People are going to be fighting to get into it and you'll find new measures that you've never heard of like, "Our metric was hourly actives per day." Not daily active users, hourly active users. So you'll start seeing that and it'll be abundantly obvious what product-market fit is. You'll know it when you see it is the bottom line.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
Okay, so you launch TBH, it goes viral, start getting offers from companies. Nine weeks later after launch, you end up selling it to Facebook. What was it like selling your company and then what was it like working at Facebook? Which you worked at for four years. I was not expecting that when I was looking at your LinkedIn. So yeah, what was it like selling? What was it like working at Facebook?

Nikita Bier (00:37:22):
Selling your company is one of the most draining processes you could ever go through as a founder. When we met with Facebook, they told me they have 80 people assigned to this deal. And I'm like, I have one person, it's just me. They were like the SWAT team of M&A.

(00:37:45):
The funniest part was they wanted to meet the team as well. And so they came out to our office in Oakland, which is a dingy old office that I got for $1,800 a month. That was our rent for the office. They arrive and they walk in. There's two engineers and one designer and me, and they're just like, "This is the whole company? This is the number one app in the United States?" I'm like, "Yeah, this is it." And when we went there, when we arrived, we joined the youth team, which was about, I don't know, 150 people just for this one division of Facebook. It was my first job effectively that I've ever had.

(00:38:31):
When they told me my title, they said I would be a product manager, I was like, "Okay, I don't know exactly what that is, but yeah, I guess that's what I do." I arrive and then I get access to a workplace system where people post all the things they're working on, and I realized it's kind of like this almost academic environment for social networks, like social network development. It's like the Harvard of social networks. I was reading all these studies that people were doing on like, "Oh, if we change that, this is the impact to retention and DAU." I was so impressed, like, "There's a whole science here."

(00:39:20):
A lot of the stuff that we did was learned from first principles, but then we saw it actually turn into systems and processes here. But the thing I didn't realize as a product manager in a large tech company is there is very little product management that you do. You're actually not as involved in the product as I had assumed. I thought, "Oh, you're the person who gets in the pixels and designs the flows." Absolutely not. You're completely detached from the design process. There's a design vertical org that does all that and they don't really want you working on that. So that was very difficult for me because when people ask me like, "What do you think you're good at?" At the core, I'm a designer. I don't consider myself a product manager. I'm great at growing things, looking at mixed panel and then designing the things that make it grow. But there's a rift between those two things inside of a large tech company.

(00:40:27):
And so I loved the academic approach to growing, but it was really hard for me personally as I became disconnected from the design process. I think that a lot of my skills atrophied over those four years. But I did stick around. I went through multiple orgs. Favorite one at the end was new product experimentation where I worked with other founders, a bunch of legends in Silicon Valley, building zero to one products, standalone apps. I mean, I was building standalone apps my entire time at Facebook. I think I built probably eight apps while I was at Facebook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:11):
Wow.

Nikita Bier (00:41:12):
But it is much, much more difficult to build apps at a large company. A lot of the insights that you have are not things that you can necessarily present or put in writing in a VP meeting, like, " We're building an app for teens to flirt." That probably is not what you would present to a bunch of McKinsey consultants at. So I think that makes it really difficult to be completely intellectually honest about what you're building. And when the team isn't honest about it, then it's really hard to iterate toward the right thing in that context. Having said that, there's a lot of things you don't have to deal with as a product... I don't have to deal think about money, I don't have to think about paying legal bills or doing finance and accounting. So all that's abstracted away, but there is regulatory stuff that you have to deal with that I had zero exposure to as a founder of a small company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:20):
An insight you're sharing there potentially is the reason a company like Facebook isn't amazing at launching completely new product, zero to one stuff, is they might be a little too risk averse and it's hard to talk about stuff that people actually really, really want deeply. Is that kind of the sense there?

Nikita Bier (00:42:37):
It's hard to really verbalize some of the things that motivate us as people. There's a tweet I put out that's kind of dogmatic in terms of how I view why people download apps and it's very simple. It's like people download apps to make or save money. Examples of that might be like WhatsApp, where free texting. And then the other reason is to find a mate, so maybe like Tinder or Snapchat, find love. And the third is to unplug from reality maybe like Netflix or Fortnite. There's a bunch of other kind of subcategories that are very utilitarian like movement, Uber or Airbnb, like shelter. And so I think putting that in a framing document and the particular nuanced reason why people are going to adopt is difficult when you're presenting that to people that are seasoned professionals and care about how something might reflect on them personally.

(00:43:51):
And so that's really difficult inside of a large company. You'd certainly have distribution advantages. If you want to just inject your app into one of the parent apps and get density within a community, you could do that. But that part I think is probably solvable for a startup if you just want to pay for ads. Getting your app into a dense friend graph is overall trivial. As a founder, you should be able to pull it off after enough tries. So that advantage that a big company brings, I mean it makes it easier, but it's not something that I think is something that a founder can't solve for themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:38):
So an interesting takeaway it sounds like is many people feel like, "I'm going to build a social app." They probably often hear, "Facebook's going to do that. Instagram's going to copy you. Snap's going to do that." And what I'm hearing here is it's not as easy as many people think, that it might be actually a lot harder for them to try something.

Nikita Bier (00:44:54):
It's not only harder for them to identify these opportunities and to verbalize it internally and align the company around it. It's also hard to respond to signals in the market. A lot of people think these incumbents are going to steal your ideas. And for the most part, it takes a pretty long time for them to respond to even the number one app or charting in the app because it'll start charting in the app store, a PM will make a post about it. And then the market's strategy or market research team might do a study to follow up on it. It'll kind of float around for a few months. They might put together a framing deck saying, "Hey, we should go after this opportunity. Let's put together this team. It'll go through VP reviews. And then it'll start development. Development might take six to 12 months." Realistically, I think most companies, large companies take 12 to 24 months to respond to competitive threats in the market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:03):
Do you think this is solvable? Is there something a company can change to get better at this? Are there companies that are good at this in your experience, or is this just as you grow, this is just what happens?

Nikita Bier (00:46:13):
The incentives within large companies make this very difficult, because you don't want to present something that you have a hunch about being a good idea because if there's not market signals already, then it's hard to defend. People in companies are focused on getting their yearly bonus or they're focused on their performance reviews. It's hard to show up into a framing meeting saying like... And a framing meeting is a meeting where you are positioning the opportunity and everything, "Here's what we should go after." It's hard to just say, "Okay, by first principles, this is a good idea and here's some very vague market signals." In reality, you need to walk in and say, "Here's the number one app in the United States and we don't own it." If you present something like that, that's pretty defensible if you fail because there was market evidence. But if you fail about something that's more based on kind of vague abstract...

(00:47:19):
So you have to, generally, the only path is to copy existing products if you want to really get momentum inside of a large organization. And for completely new concepts, it's I think very difficult to present a lot of those ideas, either to verbalize them into a document or to even get rally the organization around it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):
That's a really interesting insight.

(00:47:45):
This episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports, and analytics within your product?

(00:48:57):
Before we move on to the next chapter, I want to come back to the very first thing you said where product management is not real. Is there anything else that you can say about your insight there? Or is it basically what you described where PMs aren't actually involved in design and a company like Facebook in your experience?

Nikita Bier (00:49:14):
The functional organization structure of big tech has kind of separated product managers from the product development process in many ways. They're not looking at data because data scientists are doing that. They're just parsing some of the reports that they get back. They're mainly just writing documents and then kind of being the team secretary and running around, getting approvals from each cross-functional team, legal privacy, everything like that. And yeah, you're actually very much separated from the product itself. And so I think what Snapchat has done, and I think Apple too, to the same extent, is that designers run the show. And I think that's led to some very novel-

Nikita Bier (00:50:00):
And I think that's led to some very novel products coming out from both of those companies. But I mean that is its own host of problems because actually rolling out a product inside of a large organization, it requires a sheer force of will because it's a lot of work. I mean, there's a lot of regulatory scrutiny, scaling it up. You do need someone to project manage. And so I don't know if it's the silver bullet as to give designers the reign to run the show, but I also don't think the current traditional like Google, Facebook style of being team secretaries is also the best solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:44):
To defend product managers, I think many product managers spend a lot of time in design, spend a lot of time with data science. I think probably what you saw is like the extreme big, big, big tech version of product management. I know even PMs at Facebook can if they want to spend time with design. I think it's just obviously very different from a startup world where you're just, that's all you're doing.

Nikita Bier (00:51:05):
Yeah, it's certainly an exaggerated view, but it's particularly relevant I think for all the zero to one initiatives because if you're a product manager on a standalone app inside of a large, like you should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything. And then yeah, it should be cleaned up prototype by a technical designer, but that's your idea. And products live and die in the pixels, like consumer products, so that's on you. And that's where I think for maybe larger growth initiatives, yes, you can be a little more detached from the pixels.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:43):
I love that advice. Okay, before we move on to the next phase of your journey of starting Gas, I heard there's an interesting story around where you were actually put within the Facebook office physically, where your team was put. Is there something there?

Nikita Bier (00:51:57):
Yeah. When we joined the new product experimentation group, we were actually seated I think at basically the same desk as Mark Zuckerberg. And that was pretty cool to see how the machine runs from Zuck's view. But we had a few artifacts that we had kept with us from our old office when we were running tbh, and one of them was this kind of pop art painting that I bought on the street when I needed to get something on the walls for our office. And it was this giant painting of Tim Cook. We had been carrying it between our orgs at Facebook just because it was a funny painting. And I kind of got it because it was kind of symbolic of who actually controls our destiny, is Apple. And so when we relocated to the area where Zuck was sitting, I put up the painting on the wall and it was basically a giant painting of Tim Cook was overlooking Zuck. And eventually one of the EAs there said, "Actually, do you think you could take that home?" And it kind of made sense because you can't really have a painting of another big tech executive overlooking us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):
What does it look like? Do you happen to have it?

Nikita Bier (00:53:22):
Yeah, I actually do. Let me go grab it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):
Amazing. Oh, wow. That's artistic. So that's Tim Cook. What is the idea there that he's peeking through this darkness staring at you?

Nikita Bier (00:53:36):
Yeah, yeah. He's the real boss of all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:41):
I could see why Zuck would not want that staring at him all day. That's amazing. And I like that you still have that with you.

Nikita Bier (00:53:49):
Yeah. One of the artifacts of that chapter of life. So good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):
Okay. So that was your Facebook journey, those four years. That's wild. You left Facebook. At some point, you started, I remember this, you started tweeting like, "Hey, I'm working on new app." Everyone was going nuts. "What are you working on?" And at this point, I think you probably in your mind thought, I am this one-hit wonder, I haven't shown that I can do this again and again. And so I think you probably have this motivation. Maybe talk about that, just like this drive of like, hey, I want to do this again. Is that where your mind was at?

Nikita Bier (00:54:19):
When that meme started, my intent was to start a venture-backed company and build something that would scale to be a big team and this durable thing that lasted many years and everything. And so I just made post that I was leaving Facebook and looking for some teammates. And I shared a couple of ideas with some people privately and there were some really crazy ideas that I shared. I'm not going to get into them, but then people started posting, "Oh my God, I just saw Nikita's app. It's crazy." And what happened was others saw that and then they started memeing it and it became this massive meme where they're like, "Oh, I just tried Nikita's app, it saved my marriage. Oh, I just quit drinking. My kids returned home after all these like," and it turned into this massive meme. And at the time, I didn't even have an app or anything. I wasn't even planning to launch it. It wasn't even an app, some of the ideas I was looking at. And so it just turned into this viral moment. I wasn't even committed to starting another company at that point. This was an exploration process.

(00:55:48):
But what happened was the market had crashed shortly thereafter, there was kind of the end of the Zerb era. The Fed started hiking rates. I think my portfolio was down like 30% or something and I was like, "Damn, this sucks. Maybe I should think about how to make money today." That's the reason we're in startups is to make money. And so there was always in the back of my head this question that I had, which was what if we had monetized tbh? Because the number one support message we received was can I pay to reveal who sent me polls? It was the number one question. And it was like, would it have made even more than the acquisition if we just monetized it? And I'm like, we could probably build this pretty fast, like probably in a month, month or two. Ended up being a lot longer, but we started rebuilding it. It was a new team. It was one of the engineers from a company called Paparazzi. His name's Zay Turner, and he started building it in my house and we had tested it to see would this new version of tbh actually resonate with kids five years later? That was actually the thing I wanted to know most of all was like would an anonymous polling app actually still be relevant five years later? And so we dropped it into the school just the same way I've always done it in-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:36):
Was it the Georgia School again?

Nikita Bier (00:57:38):
Yes, actually. We launched at the exact same school that we launched tbh on the exact same day five years later, in fact. And people sent a lot of messages, but it wasn't growing. So let me pedal back here a bit. So tbh grew through variety of things, people sharing their messages to Snapchat and text invites, and that was 2017. And the way you invited your friends on tbh was that you tap their name, your contact name, and there was a button that said Invite and then we used Twilio to send them a text message. And the regulatory environment actually had changed a lot over those five years. You really can't send texts from a server anymore. It has to be sent from the user's device. And just the point of clarification is a lot of people clone tbh over the years and they think that when you voted on people in the polls, it sent them a text. We never did that. That's egregiously illegal to do and also unethical at a user experience level to send texts when people don't even know what's happening.

(00:58:57):
But anyway, we couldn't send texts over Twilio anymore, and that led to people not sending as many invites when we created Gas because they had to pop the Compose window and hit Send. They're going to just tap Invite on five names. So we actually had to reinvent all the growth systems and it took about I think like nine launches including renaming the app, including features that just never existed on tbh. So it was actually just in many ways like yeah, the concept on the surface was the same, but it was very much a zero to one development cycle of figuring out how to grow this thing again in this climate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):
I know that point is really important to you. I think a lot of people are like Nikita just sold the same app twice. What a guy. And the point you're making here is not only was the infrastructure completely different, the team was different, you had to rethink the entire flywheel of how it worked and how it grew.

Nikita Bier (01:00:05):
Yeah. And there were so many layers of like we validated one thing and then the next thing we got stuck on. Like, okay, people send a lot of messages. Cool, great. The next thing was will it spread within a school? That took us a while to get right. Will it hop schools? Each of those was a very, very challenging problem in light of the new climate that we were operating in. And I always do things by the book when it comes to operating legally within the compliance framework. And that's something when I meet founders and they tell me some growth thing that they're doing, and I'm like, "You can't do that. That's going to cause way more trouble down the line. It's going to burn users too." And so we always wanted to make it abundantly clear how our growth system, how you are inviting friends and all that. You can kind of go on a whole diatribe on that because the thing that I see a lot of founders do is they in the background use user data in ways that it shouldn't be used. They invite people on your behalf and all that.

(01:01:21):
And I have this kind of crazy view that the internet is this living and breathing thing. There's Wikipedia article called the Gaia Hypothesis, which is about biology. And it's basically like the earth is kind of living and breathing and can respond to threats. Okay? And when you enter the rainforest too deep, Ebola virus will be released. Okay? So I think the internet operates on a similar paradigm here where if you do the wrong thing by users, the internet will come back and get even and defend itself. And so whenever I design products, I try to do right by users because it'll always come back much worse and I think you should always operate above board with how you design your growth systems. And with Gas, we had to do things the right way and we had to figure out at each particular moment or problem that we solve, will it spread within schools? Will it hop schools? Will people pay for it? All of these things was a whole reinvention of the original product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
I love that you shared that because I think a lot of people see you from the outside and they think you're doing all kinds of these skeezy growth hacks and making teens do things that aren't really mentally healthy for them. But it's clear that that's the opposite of how you think about it, that you're trying to stay very positive, like you only allow positive communication. You do things that as you just said, are going to be good long-term, the internet's not going to come and try to shut you down.

Nikita Bier (01:03:00):
The point you bring up here about wanting to build a positive thing, some people, sometimes I get criticism. It's not actually that often, but they say, "Oh, you're building an app that makes teens feeling insecure or anything." But with Gas, I think we received a message every single day from a user telling us that they reconsidered suicide or other forms of self-harm. The app sent you positive messages and affirmations. It made teens feel really good. And I think that is lost on a lot of people. Instagram can make you feel jealousy and a lot of other social networks are a mixed bag in terms of impact. But we were entirely focused on making teens feel better.

(01:03:49):
And some people might say, "Oh, what if someone doesn't get voted for something?" We actually built a system to ensure everyone got a vote. And what we did was we put your name in polls at a higher frequency if you weren't being voted on recently. So we wanted to spread the love in every way possible, and that's what really motivated me to grow this thing was watching how it was impacting 10 million kids in such a short period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):
I really appreciate you adding that. I didn't know all those things about the way you thought about these apps. Interestingly, I don't know how much you can go into this, but there is a lot of stuff going on with Gas around human trafficking and all this stuff where people thought people were being kidnapped through Gas, which is yeah, talk about that whatever you can because that's pretty crazy.

Nikita Bier (01:04:41):
We had this hoax started where people were saying the app was used for human trafficking. And I was like, "This is so strange." This is a anonymous polling app without messaging and the only thing you could do is send compliments to your friends. And I researched into it and I saw that this is actually plaguing a lot of apps and any app that has gone viral in any way has actually had this hoax started. And part of the reason it happens is it gets you attention if you say that about an app. As a teenager, if you say, "Oh, this app is dangerous," and then you get a bunch of followers and who doesn't love followers? So it's actually a really viral piece of content if you put it out. And so we had this hoax started and we were like, "This could kill the company." And I talked to a bunch of founders that it happened to them and they said, "Yeah, we had to shut down because of that."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:40):
Wow.

Nikita Bier (01:05:40):
And I was like, "Is this it? Is this the end of the company?" And I remember it hit number one when we started getting a few of these reports in our support channels. And I was like, "I'm just going to plant the flag on posts that we hit number one in the App Store because this thing's probably going to shut down soon." So I make this announcement on Twitter, "I just made the number one app and I thought it would just be dead in a week." And then I just had this sudden burst of energy and I was like, "I'm going to win. I'm going to fight this. This is not true. It makes no sense at all."

(01:06:20):
And so we fought it at every vector possible, this completely made up hoax. We met with journalists, reporters to make sure that the number one match every time you search Gas app human trafficking was Gas app is not for human trafficking. And so that ended up being The Washington Post headline. We insisted that that be the headline if we do the interview. So that was the first thing that showed up on Google anytime someone searched it. There were schools and even a police station that posted that this app is used for human trafficking. I called those superintendents, I called those police chiefs and have got them to publicly retract it. And we had some of the reviews on the App Store. We asked Apple to remove them because we got review bombed.

(01:07:07):
But the thing that actually was the most impactful was my girlfriend made a video, a TikTok video explaining that it's not true. And anytime someone deleted their account, they could watch this video explaining it's not true. And at the peak, we had 3% of users deleting their accounts per day. So it was like a catastrophe for an app and we got it down to 0.1% through relentless, relentless effort. And it was really just an unusual thing that happens when you grow really fast is this human trafficking hoax that starts. And you don't understand how crazy it is until it happens to your company, but it was kind of hilarious to think about. This app was the most harmless benign thing you could think of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
This is insane. I did not know this full story. And you were doing all this while you were trying to scale the app and trying to keep the servers up and try to grow it, right? What was that like to try to manage all these things at once?

Nikita Bier (01:08:13):
I was sleeping three hours a day for three months. It was extraordinarily difficult to do it all. Our team was also relentless though. They would come over to my house 9:00 a.m. stay until midnight and just do that seven days a week. So yeah, it was definitely one of the most physically draining things ever, but we were just so tactical. I remember investors were asking to meet with us and I said, "If you can't get a celebrity to post that this isn't true, then we're not interested." But yeah, we went after it on every vector and it ended up being okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:59):
I love how you took your brain to this other completely different problem and thought about all the levers you could use to change the conversation around the app.

Nikita Bier (01:09:09):
Yeah. I remember we had these TikTok videos that were made that were saying it was true and I networked my way all the way to the CEO of TikTok and I said, "Can you delete these?" And we got this information deleted. Yeah, so it was really a whole new test of our team's capacities was fighting. The key thing that you have to know though when you have a hoax spreading about your app is you really have to make sure the hoax is less viral than your app. And at a few points, the hoax was more viral than our app and we had to take this-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):
The K-factor of the hoax.

Nikita Bier (01:09:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:51):
That's absurd. Okay. So broadly, you built this app. Again, a big success. I saw a stat that you made $11 million in sales through the app, 10 million downloads. Is that right?

Nikita Bier (01:10:03):
Yeah. It was a blowout success in terms of like it grew bigger than tbh. We monetized it. We ran almost entirely on startup credits, so it was basically-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:17):
Like Cloud Credits? Like AWS Credits?

Nikita Bier (01:10:20):
Yeah. AWS Credits, Mixpanel. I remember when I saw the early data, I'm like, "Okay, now it's time for me to negotiate every bill down to the last cent of margin for every vendor." And I got credits everywhere, and so we really were tactical with that. And so we ended up being all just pure cashflow for the team. We had no investors. And it was just so interesting though that the way that I started posting about it on Twitter was it kind of captured the zeitgeist of the internet. And we didn't intend on selling it. We were just going to let this thing run its course and just be this app that kind of lives in the background of our lives. But once it started capturing the zeitgeist of Twitter, I was like, "Wait a minute, we could probably sell this thing." And that's when we started engaging with some of these, we ended up getting three companies that wanted to buy it. I won't be able to say them, but ultimately we ended up selling to Discord and we joined Discord.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):
Awesome. So before we move on to the next part of the journey and some of the other insights that I want to get into, is there any lasting lessons that you took away from Gas as a product that you take with you to advising startups in terms of building the product design? I know there's many, but any that stand out most that you think are really interesting to share?

Nikita Bier (01:11:50):
I think I kind of touched on this before, which was trying to validate things in a sequence of like, will people use the core flow? Will people spread it within their peer group? Will it hop peer groups? And what I think the most important thing that I learned is that's actually a really great way to do zero to one product development is execute at 100% for the thing you're trying to validate at that specific stage of the product development cycle. And then you can kind of half-ass the rest just so you can get 100% signal on that one part.

(01:12:25):
And so we made the polling experience just perfect. The questions were great. Push notifications, everything worked. And then the next stage was getting sharing and virality working. And so compartmentalizing those things because ultimately you'll have too much scope creep if you try to solve everything at once and validate. And also you're not going to get signal too, like you're trying to test one thing at a time. So the way that now I approach a lot of consumer product development is if this is true, then what next needs to be true for this thing to work out? And these layers of conditional statements. And the more layers you have, the higher risk your product is, so you should try to condense it to about like four things that must be true for the thing to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:06):
And this comes back to your advice of the thing you need to get good at is testing and learning and making it really quick.

Nikita Bier (01:13:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:13):
Okay. Maybe one last thing along this thread. I'm just really curious how this hoax came to be, like who's behind it? How does this happen?

Nikita Bier (01:13:20):
We got a original support message, which was a screenshot of a story on Snapchat and it said, "Do not download the Gas app. It's for human trafficking." Okay? And it was a screenshot that had like that mirror effect where you have like 10 people that screenshotted it. More, like 40 people because it had all the usernames. So I was looking at this and I'm like, "How many people have seen this?" And it looked like a viral thing on Snapchat. And then I went to the App Store page and I saw a review that said this app is for human trafficking. And I went to my team and I said, "This will probably kill the company. This will kill the product. I've seen this before with consumer apps and it's evident to me this is going to be 10 times bigger tomorrow." And they were like, "No. It's just one message. What do you mean?" I'm like, "No, no, it's been screenshotted 40 times and now it's on the App Store page." And we got another message four hours later.

(01:14:35):
And the next day, it was our entire App Store page was just covered with reviews saying that the app's for human trafficking. And we actually had to rebrand the app. We relaunched it once and we're like, "Let's just call it something different. Just relaunch it on the other side of the country." We did that, started going viral again. And the craziest-

Nikita Bier (01:15:00):
... again. And the craziest thing was it re-emerged and what happened was one user was friends with another person in another state and they got an invitation. And that user told them, "Oh, that was in my state. It's actually for human trafficking." And then it just completely started again and then it was too late at that point to relaunch again. We just realized, " We got to fight this thing." And ultimately, I don't think we'll ever know the true origin, but it was definitely a living, breathing like hoax.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):
That is insane. The story just gets more and more interesting. What were some of the previous names, by the way? Is that something you can share?

Nikita Bier (01:15:52):
Yeah, we went through a bunch. One of them was called Crush, one of them was called Melt, and another was... The interesting thing about Crush is we got a great domain. We thought this would be the name. This was between some of the re-brands. We tested it and we saw that invitations dropped significantly under the Crush name and we were like, "What's going on here?" And we found that actually when you invite someone to an app, regardless of the app, you generally... Boys invite boys, girls invite girls to apps. And boys didn't want to invite their friends to an app called Crush with a pink icon.

(01:16:35):
And then we looked at the data and the app. I mean this was true TBH too, which was the app indexed about 60 to 65% women. So we were just like, "Let's make the app more masculine and see what happens. We need balance on this." So we made the icon black with a flame, called it Gas and the invites rate jumped. And you think a name doesn't matter, but right at the moment of sending an invite... So that was one of the interesting insights on the naming process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:07):
Man, there's just endless stories that we could keep getting into, but we've also gone very long, so I'm going to try to move on to another topic. So I ask people on Twitter what to ask you? Just that question got a thousand likes just me asking, "What should I ask Nikita?" And the most common question, I'm sure you get this a lot, is just people wondering, do you ever want to build a durable consumer app? Is it possible to build a durable consumer app?

(01:17:30):
Scott Belsky asked this, Robert at Figma asked this, and Scott actually had a really nice way of describing it about why are so many quick sensation consumer apps proving to be more akin to summer songs than enduring standalone products and businesses? So there's kind of two questions here. One is, do you aim to build a durable consumer app? And two, how possible is it?

Nikita Bier (01:17:54):
A lot of the fundamental tools for communicating with our friends either messaging or broadcasting one-to-many like on stories or the incumbents have built pretty large motes in terms of network effects and to provide true an order of magnitude better experience is non-trivial because they've been actually improving these products so much over the years and there's not that many entry points.

(01:18:31):
Not to say that it's not impossible. Snapchat was showed that there was style of messaging that people wanted that the incumbents weren't serving. But I think there's these kind of edges that you can go after with a much higher probability of success and they might not actually be something that's durable necessarily. And I think finding durability for a communication or social product, that's a black swan event. Retention for consumer social is there's a tremendous amount of randomness. There's one every decade. If it was simple, I would just be printing $1 trillion companies.

(01:19:15):
I be printing Facebook's every time I sat down. But I think it's actually a lot of it is pure randomness. On the other hand, growing a product can be a science. With certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Now why haven't I tried to take the viral part and build something that has been durable or long-lasting? I'll tell you a little bit about my motivations. My favorite part about product development is you make this thing through the night. You build it and you watch it take over the internet.

(01:19:54):
That is the most thrilling drug I think you could ever experience. And just watching it spread all over the country is like you drop an app in the deep south in Georgia and then you look on your analytics dashboard and 40% of the high school down your street in Los Angeles has downloaded it one week later. That's a really profound feeling. It's crazy to have that sort of impact as a three-person team, and I live for that.

(01:20:26):
When I joined Facebook, here's an interesting connection. So I joined Facebook and I saw that many of my peers were looking up to VPs and they're like, "That's what I want to make it to one day. I want to run a large organization. I want to have lots of reports." And then I met with VPs and they were actually jealous of me because my quality of life was actually pretty cool. I got to build something high impact that made many teens feel better about themselves, made a decent amount of money. And then I wasn't in charge of this becoming a people manager that has to run this large organization for many years.

(01:21:11):
I think one day I will run maybe a venture scale business, but I will say that I kind of like the way that I've been doing things so far in terms of quality of life and being fun. Financially, it's been great. So I think that part is what motivates me. And yeah, I don't think running a large corporation is necessarily what I described as fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):
That's amazing, man. I am really happy we went here. So much of this resonates with the way I think. And obviously, a big part of this is also just it's very hard, as you said, to build a consumer app that grows first of all. Second, that actually lasts. But that is interesting that you do hope to one day build a venture funded business.

Nikita Bier (01:22:03):
I mean TBH was venture backed, but I just don't... I think I'm going to have to... Do I want to sign up for 10 years? And if you actually look at some of the numbers on the actual proceeds that some of these founders get after an IPO, after seven rounds of dilution, a lot of them are pretty comparable to what we get from our apps for 90 days of work. So yeah, the trade-offs there are pretty faithful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:36):
Actually, just on that note, so what would make you actually decide to go venture funded? You talked about how if you're going more mainstream, non-teens folks after 22 years old, is that why you would go that route?

Nikita Bier (01:22:47):
I don't think that it's necessarily that part. I think if I could keep the team lean and scale up... I think there's some actual founders that actually operate very lean teams and have reached very large scale in terms of the valuations of the company. Actually the most iconic example is Elon Musk. His teams are actually pretty thin overall and he's in the weeds doing product development. And so I think, yeah, if I was to ever do it, I would do it under very specific set of operating principles versus turning it into a big tech company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:34):
Queue investor is emailing you right now with term sheets. Okay. Nikita, this has been amazing. There's one last segment I want to spend a little time on, which is just kind of a rapid fire of pieces of advice you've shared that I think is incredibly insightful about how to build a successful consumer app. And so I'm thinking I'll just go through three to five and see what you think and see what you can add to the advice. How does that sound?

Nikita Bier (01:23:59):
Sounds great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:00):
Okay, cool. So the first is just contact permissions in iOS 18 changes the game and how people can grow apps basically makes it harder to invite your friends. Thoughts on how people should be thinking about this in their products.

Nikita Bier (01:24:15):
When I first saw it, I was really concerned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:19):
I saw your tweet about it. You're like, "That's the end. Game over."

Nikita Bier (01:24:23):
Just let me frame things up for you. The contact permissions screen, you average about 65% approval rate across all apps. It's higher for teens, lower for adults, but if you have a 65% consenting to contacts access, then the next step on this new iOS 18 change is you select which contacts you want to allow the app to access. And it's an alphabetical list. And that alphabetical list for me, I have 550 contacts or something.

(01:24:55):
The first 10 contacts are punctuation symbols from whatever dirty entry I put when I was driving or something. So you have to scroll down and find that name. So I have to find Lenny. I have to add you. And what if you're not an app user? So I just added you or three others. Assuming users are willing to even do that. You and then the three others never sign up, but maybe three of your friends do.

(01:25:24):
But I never get connected to them because there's no over... So my expectation is it's going to be very difficult to find friends on apps going forward to invite friends on apps going forward. And that founders will need to rethink how they do it. And of the companies, I'm working with on intro, we are looking at ways to reinvent what contact sync is or what purpose it served. It's not promising, but we have some good leads and I think we'll have a whole new set of apps emerging as a consequence. But if you're betting on contact sync as a company right now, you better start thinking about plan B.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:14):
So what I take away here is just it is now much different and there's an opportunity to think of something really clever that would give you a huge advantage if you can crack it.

Nikita Bier (01:26:23):
Yes, but most likely I think most apps will not have social graphs going forward and this will entrench incumbents even more. I don't think Apple acknowledged that. I think the person that designed the feature probably has never built an app or done contact sync before because the flow is egregiously bad and it doesn't actually even, I think, benefit the user's privacy because it just completely eliminates the feature altogether.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:53):
Okay, next topic. So you helped this product called Dupe succeed. It's doing incredibly well from what I can see. And I saw you tweet about one of the key things that you helped them through, which is to invert, I'm reading this quote, "Inverting the time to value so that the user experience is the aha moment in seconds." Talk about that insight and how important that is to building a successful consumer social app.

Nikita Bier (01:27:18):
This kind of concept of getting users to the aha moment is something I recurringly bring up to every company I work with. And you have to understand that in 2024, people's attention spans are like three seconds. It's really sad, but we are spread thin through so many notifications, products, everything that if you can't demonstrate value in the first three seconds, it's over. And this also leads back to the contact sync question that you talked about was you have to sign up and then the first night you have to see all of your friends on the app and experience it, otherwise you'll churn.

(01:27:55):
So this idea of inverting the value, when I was working with Dupe, they had this kind of shopping app that had a bunch of different features and there was one feature that I saw that was interesting called Deal Hop and it allowed you to just put in a product page and it would find the cheapest version of it online. Something I already do through a bunch of duct taped methods of Google image search, Google Lens. And I was like, "That should be a whole company. But how are we going to teach users to do it and how do we expose them to that aha moment as fast as possible in a memorable iconic way?"

(01:28:38):
I had this product I built a while back where you just type the domain in front of an existing URL. So I told them, "You should try this. It's very marketable, but you need to get a very short domain that matches what you're doing." And so he went out and bought Dupe.com for I don't know how much, but when he bought that I was pretty excited. I'm like, well, if this doesn't work, I'm going to feel terrible, but if it does work, it's going to be a blowout success.

(01:29:05):
So we put out a couple videos about it and then it was iconic, went viral, the videos. Users remembered to do it, to type dupe.com in front of a URL. Now I think they're making millions in ARR in a matter, and I think under 60 days of launching. And that was a blowout success. And of the companies I work with, I would say it happens about 50% of the time we hit that much success, but we hit success. I think 50% of the time it's outright failure because consumer is so random.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):
And so what I'm hearing is a big insight is just ideally get to three seconds time to value. Is that the advice?

Nikita Bier (01:29:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:52):
Sounds great. Easy peasy.

Nikita Bier (01:29:55):
Yeah. You really have to craft onboarding everything to ensure that that's where the design part comes in of being a great product person.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):
I imagine a big part of this is just cutting things you think... Like killing your darlings, cutting things you think people need and just being really ruthless with that,.

Nikita Bier (01:30:20):
Really ruthless, but also being extraordinarily creative with how you use the tools available to activate a user. I think extraordinary product people are deeply aware of every possible API and how it can be used in non-traditional ways. Like this URL trick was something that I think was non-traditional that people adopted very quickly. I have a whole laundry list of iOS mechanisms that people use for a certain way today, but you could invert them.

(01:30:59):
Contact sync is a great example because you sync your contacts and then it finds all the friends and then ranks the people who are not on the app yet but have a bunch of friends on it. So there's a bunch of ways that you can one tap, expose a ton of value to users that I think founders often neglect. A lot of founders will go and say, "Oh, they can just exchange usernames and that's how they can add each other."

(01:31:27):
That is the most unrealistic thing ever because that means you have to see the username, type it into the app. You have to do that what 50 times to get a 50-person friend list. So we're looking at 10,000 taps versus one. So that's what I mean by trying to get people to the activation moment, the aha moment and get them to value.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):
I love that advice. So maybe as just a last question along these lines. When you come to a founder, a relationship that you're a startup, you're trying to help, is there one more thing that you find often ends up being really helpful to them? Any common piece of advice that's like, "Oh, this is probably what's going to help you." You talked about this aha moment step, the contact sharing stuff. I guess is there anything else that's just like this is something that's probably going to help you with your app?

Nikita Bier (01:32:20):
Right now, I think I advise around 35, 36 companies and all of them are at different stages of challenges they're facing. Some of them are pure at the product concept stage. Some of them are venture backed billion-dollar companies and each of them faces different problems. The first thing I often do is I ask them to show me the analytics. We look at how people are distributing the app today, what is the milestone that a user must hit to become activated and what's getting in the way of that?

(01:33:03):
I also take a very deep look at every funnel that users come through. And I think a lot of founders separate marketing and product growth, like top of funnel growth from the actual products growth mechanisms, but they're both the same. They both should be treated as the same. If you're targeting a community and you want them to all adopt and get saturation, you need to build marketing that shows imagery of that community or whatever. And then when you get in the app, you have to be able to join that community.

(01:33:48):
When you invite people from that app, that community needs to be mentioned. You need to actually cover everything from the ads to the in-app experience. All of that needs to be aligned for a user acquisition and flywheel to spin. A lot of people really screw that up. That's my initial rough approximation of what I do when I come in and try to fix or try to help with some of the challenges these companies are facing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):
So this is actually a great segue to the final thing I want to make sure people understand is you help companies through this. Talk about how you work with companies where they can find you, what kind of companies you're looking to work with and how all that works.

Nikita Bier (01:34:29):
So I work across the gamut. Most of them are consumer mobile companies and there certainly are web ones too, but I work with companies across stages. Typically, I recommend that you don't book me unless you're venture backed because it's a little expensive. But my main goal when someone does seek my advice through intro is I try to make them 10 times back their money in the first 30 days. And so far I think I've managed to do that with anyone who's met with me. And that means get all the table stakes, grow things out of the way, at the minimum.

(01:35:11):
Then identify two to three step function changes that could change their growth trajectory. And these are higher scope fundamental changes to the product. So I try to couple both, explain to them which direction I believe they should go, and it's a conversation and we talk about it. And then once they settle on a direction, I tend to get in the pixels. I go into Figma and we do a live session together and clean things up. I identify, "Oh, that's going to convert at this percent." And then I just manage all that. But yeah, it's generally post-series A.

(01:35:49):
Some seed stage companies, and it's been really fun. It's kept my mind sharp on where the market is headed. I've also, over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about. And so I share those when it's relevant for the company and it's been great. Dupe was one of them. I was advising Saturn. I rebuilt their Friend Finder. I think believe they're number one in the productivity section above ChatGPT as of today. But I think I've generally invested in about maybe 10% of the companies that seek out my advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:31):
Amazing. Well, I know it feels expensive to some people, but if I were a company with cash, it feels like the best deal I could find someone like you to come in and actually help me think through deeply in the pixels how to make my thing work. So I think you're still undercharging and I hope you keep raising your prices because clearly there's a lot of demand. Nikita, this was incredible. I feel like people see you on Twitter and they're like, "Oh, this guy, he's such a jerk sometimes." But meeting you in person and talking to you, it's very clear. You're really a kind dude, really thoughtful. All your advice is based on real things you have done. It's not just you sitting around pontificating and I think that's incredibly valuable and I'm excited. People are tapping that knowledge and you're sharing it with people in a wider scale.

Nikita Bier (01:37:15):
It's been a pleasure. Thanks for having me. We covered a lot and there's plenty more. I hope to come back after the next viral hit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:26):
Oh man. So I was going to ask you, is there anything you're working on now or stages, what can you share? [inaudible 01:37:33]. Stay tuned.

Nikita Bier (01:37:26):
Stay tuned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:34):
Here we go. Amazing. I always ask people how can listeners be useful to you? So let me just ask you that as a final question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Nikita Bier (01:37:41):
Follow me on Twitter and enjoy my shit posts. And I hope you have as much fun as me on Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:49):
I do, man. I love your tweets. Nikita, thank you so much for doing this and for being here.

## Transcript

Nikita Miller (00:00):
And many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal, and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much.

Lenny (00:52):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikita Miller. A huge thank you to Camille Ricketts for recommending Nikita and for connecting us. Nikita is senior vice president and head of product at The Knot Worldwide. Before that, she was VP of product at Dooly, and before that she was head of growth and retention at Trello for over five years. In our conversation, we dig into how product managers and people getting married are similar, a bunch of advice on getting into product management, a really cool framework for how to align roles and responsibilities within your cross-functional teams, a bunch of advice for working effectively as a remote and distributed team, and the one question that Nikita asks constantly to get the most out of her teams. Nikita is amazing and I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Nikita Miller after a short word from our sponsors.

(01:51):
This episode is brought to you by wealth fronts. Anyone paying attention to the stock market over the past few years knows it's been a wild ride. Many people who made risky stock bets during the bull market are now facing big losses and wondering how to make better informed investments going forward. That's why I'm excited to tell you about Wealthfront's new stock investing product, which is specifically designed to help you make better stock investments. It has all the features you'd expect, including fractional share, zero commissions and $1 minimum. But what sets it apart is a unique feature called Stock Collections. These are groups of stocks created by Wealthfront's investment team that are designed around unique investment opportunities. You can think of Wealthfront Stock Collections like Spotify Discovery Playlists, but instead of helping you find new songs, they help you discover new companies and themes to invest in.

(02:38):
For example, some popular collections right now are dividend to blue chip stocks, semiconductor leaders, and rising interest rates, and each collection includes a summary of the opportunity and trade-offs to help you make more intelligent investing decisions. To start investing with just $1, visit wealthfront.com/lenny. And note, I'm a Wealthfront client and they arranged for me to share this product with you. Important disclosures and details can be found in the show notes. Are you hiring, or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand curated people who are open to new opportunities.

(03:21):
Thousands of people apply to join this collective, and I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a new opportunity, actively or passively, join the collective. It's free, you can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave anytime and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. Nikita, welcome to the podcast.

Nikita Miller (03:59):
Hey, Lenny. Thank you. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (04:02):
I'm excited to have you. So I don't know if you know this, but I'm actually having a kid in a couple months and I've been doing a lot of reading, as you do when you're going to be a parent. And I was reading a lot of stuff on The Bump, which turns out I realized was something that it was in your umbrella of products.

Nikita Miller (04:15):
It a part of The Knot Worldwide. Yeah.

Lenny (04:17):
And then I realized y'all have that for pregnancy, you have a site to help you with proposals, you have a site for obviously wedding planning and vendors and just party planning in general. And so is the general strategy to be there for every adulting milestone in life? Is that the plan?

Nikita Miller (04:34):
Yes. That's a nice way of putting it. We talk about it as being there for the big celebrations in life. We have these celebratory moments that mark adulthood, and so to be part of that journey, we primarily focus in the wedding space but yes, across the whole journey.

Lenny (04:52):
It feels like the two pieces you're missing are divorce and funerals. Is that the plan or do you want to stick to happy things?

Nikita Miller (05:00):
I think we're sticking to celebrations. I think we're leaning on the world needs a lot more celebration right now, so helping folks do that.

Lenny (05:07):
You're here. Okay, cool. It's a really smart strategy. It makes a lot of sense, once you get someone with their wedding and then they expand from there.

Nikita Miller (05:15):
And their friends too.

Lenny (05:18):
Interesting, right, because they register on The Knot and they'll know what's going on there.

Nikita Miller (05:22):
That's right. You register.

Lenny (05:24):
Genius. So we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned along your time there, but I wanted to start with your previous gig at Atlassian and specifically leading growth and retention at Trello. Many people listening to this podcast either use Trello and love Trello or are thinking about using Trello, and so I thought it'd be interesting to hear just who do you find Trello is the most ideal for? When is it good and smart to go with Trello versus Jira or Linear or Asana or something like that?

Nikita Miller (05:53):
A few things. So I think Trello initially started out as being the task management or planning tool for anyone as opposed to the others you just mentioned, which tend to be in software in our industry, and that's who we're geared towards. Trello when it first started was very much on being simplicity of design, being easy to use, tactile, easy to onboard. You don't need customization, you can use it in single-player mode or multi-player mode. And so that meant that at the beginning, we got a lot of people using the product that were small businesses, that were families, that were people planning their weddings potentially. 

(06:32):
And then over time, as our users became more sophisticated or had more problems to solve, that's how I think we evolved and grew with them. So some of it's around this concept of progressive disclosure where you start with a small problem and as it gets more sophisticated, Trello grows with you, whereas I think some of the other products, they start with complexity and if you want something simpler, you kind of have to pull things away or tease things apart. And that was definitely something that helps Trello stand out. I think now, many years later, you'll find that Trello is very fully featured and fully powered and they now lean into that a lot more, but that wasn't always the case.

Lenny (07:14):
So it sounds like Trello broadly was meant for a lot more than just software teams building product?

Nikita Miller (07:18):
Yes. It started off I think being inspired by software teams and wanting to understand how to move and manage tasks easily. That was the origin story, but then very quickly became the kind of tool that anyone could use to manage anything. And now I think we're back more the product is way more towards the software development and that's a lot more of the competitive advantage, but I think the people that are excited about Trello and the ones that made Trello really impactful weren't necessarily software.

Lenny (07:50):
Got it. When you think back to your time helping grow and retain folks on Trello, is there a big win or something you're really proud of that you think back to that was a huge success in that time to help Trello grow more or be more successful?

Nikita Miller (08:07):
That's probably not what you'd guess. So when I started Trello, I actually joined to build out Trello's enterprise business. And so a lot of our growth and retention was actually about how to get more teams into the product and then spreading it throughout the org, so not only software teams but sales teams or marketing teams. And so the big push there was around collaboration. How do you create a shared perspective for everyone working on a project, not just a software team?

(08:38):
So we had a good time thinking through what's the customer experience, but obviously in the context of enterprise, which for Trello at the time was really tricky because it's such a customer first product, I think shifting our mindset to understand enterprise and teams specifically as a cohort was very different. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that or the team did a good job of that, and I think being a part now of the Atlassian suite definitely leaned into that even more.

Lenny (09:09):
Was there a specific feature that unlocked a lot of opportunity or is it just broadly, there's a bunch of little things you have to add?

Nikita Miller (09:15):
I think it was broadly a bunch of little things. So all the enterprise features that you can imagine that all products need to operate at the enterprise level, smaller features around labels like how do you color them? How do you name them, when do they appear? When you invite people, do you invite individuals or do you invite teams? So a lot of the work was around going from single player or two, three player mode to 5, 10, 20 people.

Lenny (09:41):
Got it. Coming back to the question of Trello versus Jira, because I think this might be interesting to people. Just if you're trying to decide should we use Trello or should we use Jira, what's a simple way to think about which way to go as a founder maybe or as a product team?

Nikita Miller (09:55):
I think that smaller teams, especially folks that are ideating, when you haven't landed on what you're going to build yet, I think Trello's a great product for that. For pulling ideas, for prioritizing them, for tracking how we're progressing through discovery, I think Trello's really great for that. For things that have been decided and are ready to go and are really in the breakdown these tasks and assign it to people, then something like Jira is probably a better use case, but I'm sure there people that'll disagree with that.

Lenny (10:29):
Cool. Building for PMs is what you were doing while you were working in Trello. I imagine that's kind of a bittersweet experience. I imagine in some sense they're an amazing market to sell to, on the other they're probably really annoying. What's a surprise maybe or a lesson about working on building products for product managers?

Nikita Miller (10:46):
I think you're right, it is a bitter sweet place to be. I think I less thought of it as building for product managers and just thought about it in the context of productivity overall. And productivity software in itself is really what's bittersweet because there are a lot of trade-offs and when you're dealing with a software team, for instance, how you measure productivity or define it for a PM or a designer or engineer and a data scientist is probably really different. And so the impossibility of solving for all of those use cases I think is always what's challenging, and we know that no one product is actually going to solve all of those use cases, no matter what the marketing taglines are out there.

(11:29):
And so it was really challenging to figure out what are the core things that a product manager might need to see or a designer or a developer, and how do you make sure that that core is there? So you get the 80% and then you spend time on the 20% that you know a very small segment of users are going to use, but they're probably your core, so maybe you spend some time there. But the answer is no one's going to be happy, and with Trello in particular it was challenging because for a while we built a product that was easy to use for everyone, and so then trying to really narrow in on well, what is a software development use case and what do we really need for that? And that might be very different from what a mom-and-pop shop is going to need or someone planning their wedding is going to need.

Lenny (12:15):
That's a good segue to something else I wanted to ask about. You used to build for product managers and now you build for people getting married. I'm curious what is similar about those two groups and what's maybe most different?

Nikita Miller (12:26):
A lot of similarity. So folks planning their weddings, think of it as an emotional, high stakes thing that you're hopefully going to do once, and so the pressure is really there. The pressure and expectations are really high, not unlike product managers or other folks in software, and ultimately wedding planning is this huge project where you have a bunch of stakeholders, friends, family. You need to manage multiple vendors, and the time horizon for a wedding once you're engaged is anywhere from 12 to 18 months, so it is a longtime project. I think there's a lot of similarities there. 

(13:06):
Some of the things that are a little bit different in terms of how we're building the product is the amount of decisions probably that need that go into wedding planning are far more than you'd imagine. So one of the reasons being at the Knot is so interesting is we go all the way from planning tools, so actively, how do you help people find inspiration and plan their wedding day-to-day to two-sided marketplace. We have our e-commerce business that's supposed to be registry and paper and obviously our affiliate businesses and the ads businesses, so it's a little bit different from a SaaS productivity tool, the business that we're in, but a lot of the problems that we're solving for users are actually really simpler.

Lenny (13:48):
Which one's more, I don't know, stress inducing.

Nikita Miller (13:51):
That's a great question. I think that couples, it's such an emotional thing for people, for individuals and their families and their friends, so I personally feel like I empathize with that in a way that I don't do the same for product even though I'm a product manager, because there are many projects and there're always things that we need to manage and that's just part of the gig. Whereas planning your wedding, for couples this is for many the most meaningful time of their lives, and everyone does this differently. So we have folks that are planning their multi-hundred person weddings and then there are 10, 15 closest friends weddings, but the emotional side of it is the same and you don't want to let them down because most aren't going to do it again.

Lenny (14:38):
Yeah, okay. That's what I would've guessed. It feels like wedding couples are more stressed. I just had an idea. I imagine you think about this. We're doing a baby shower right now and it feels like you're missing a opportunity to do the baby shower invite platform.

Nikita Miller (14:51):
Yes, we've thought about it.

Lenny (14:54):
And also registry, a registry platform.

Nikita Miller (14:56):
Yes, also that.

Lenny (14:59):
Okay, okay. So many opportunities.

Nikita Miller (15:00):
All the life moments.

Lenny (15:01):
Oh my God. One last question about Trello. Do you have any just tips for someone using Trello and may not be aware of something they could do with  Trello?

Nikita Miller (15:09):
I think the biggest that people probably know about but are often underutilized are Power-Ups, which is basically our integrations. And Power-ups are folks that are usually doing things that are more complex, often. But Trello, when you think about it with other products like Asana, as you mentioned, Linear, some of what people are worried about is that it's just not powerful enough, and Power-Ups are a way to do that. And there are dozens and hundreds of integrations that you can use it for. So that's worth checking out.

Lenny (15:39):
Awesome. Great tip. Shifting a little bit and zooming out, you've worked at a lot of different companies at a lot of different levels, also a lot of different geographies and I want to chat about that last piece. But maybe just broadly, what are a few of your biggest lessons about building successful and impactful teams?

Nikita Miller (15:59):
This is kind of my jam.

Lenny (16:01):
Excellent.

Nikita Miller (16:02):
It's kind of what I spend a lot of time thinking about, and I think every company go into you approach it slightly differently. For me, it usually starts with individuals identifying very clearly early on roles and responsibilities, like what are the expectations of a role? So in software, for most of us one of the things that I think I've seen done well or contributed to and multiple companies is the triad, product, design, engineering, data. And what does it look like for these roles and data science that's like other?

Lenny (16:38):
I see you put data in there.

Nikita Miller (16:42):
I'm trying pull that in. That is my mission. I love that. My mission is product, design, engineering, data.

Lenny (16:47):
It's not a triad anymore though, but I love it.

Nikita Miller (16:50):
I know. It's a quartet something.

Lenny (16:50):
It's just a chair.

Nikita Miller (16:53):
It's a chair. Great. So I think about that a lot. What are the roles? What do you expect for each of them and how do you define the responsibilities that we have to each other? I know it sounds maybe on the softer side, but I think a lot of what we can solve for in creating strong teams is exactly that. The exercise that I often do is I generally have an idea of what I think the roles and responsibilities are and the expectations across these four roles, but the exercise especially with leaders in an org is to have them sit down and write them for each other.

(17:29):
So Atlassian has some of this that they do in the form of playbooks, but it's basically I as a product leader, I'm going to write down what I think the expectations and the role and responsibilities of my engineering manager, of my designer, of my data. And then we look at it together and then we arrive at essentially a contract with one another about what we think that looks like and what that responsibility is to our teams, and from there, we cascade it throughout the org. This is very time-intensive, as you can imagine, and often leads to a lot of debate because depending on the kind of orgs or people's backgrounds, our expectations might differ, but I think that contract early on is really important.

Lenny (18:08):
This is super interesting and I want to go two levels deeper. Is there a template that you have? Is there specific questions you're answering? Is it freeform? How do you actually know what to write in one of these?

Nikita Miller (18:21):
There is a template. There are templates we can probably share after this-

Lenny (18:24):
Awesome. Great.

Nikita Miller (18:25):
... to run the roles and responsibilities, and it usually comes in a couple of forms. It's what the expectations as an IC? What's the expectation as a manager or with your team? And then what is it to each other and what are the things that are shared? So when we're running an experiment, a product manager's likely to write a product brief and go into the details of what that means. The data scientist is likely to help write the actual experiment brief, but we're all putting inputs into it. But then when it comes to data and analysis, my expectation is that both of you are doing that together.

Lenny (19:01):
And is the idea the PM writes, "Here's what I'm planning to do," is it the data scientist writes on behalf of the pm, "Here's what I expect you to do?" Who's taking the charge in each of these?

Nikita Miller (19:11):
You write your own. So I as a product manager, I write what I think my role is and also what I think what my expectations of my counterparts are and they do the same, and then we review it together.

Lenny (19:23):
And you encourage every team within your domain to do this amongst themselves. 

Nikita Miller (19:28):
Yes. 

Lenny (19:29):
That is very cool. If there's an example you could share that we could put in the show notes or a template, that would be great.

Nikita Miller (19:35):
Yeah. We'll do that.

Lenny (19:36):
What have you found as impact that comes from doing this a before and after? What kind of difference do you see having done this on team?

Nikita Miller (19:45):
So I'd say recently, I'd say in the past maybe five years, one of the things that has shifted and has caught some people by surprise, I don't know if it should or not, is around project management. So I think 10, 12 years ago, everyone expected that they would have Scrum Masters, and Scrum Masters have largely in many companies just disappeared. But then you think well, where did that responsibility go, because someone has to do project management? And this is different from program management internal to a team. 

(20:18):
And from my perspective, a lot of that now sits with engineering managers, which is a little bit different from how it was when I started in product where actually, a lot of that was put on PMs. And some of you might recall, it caused a lot of issues with product managers because they were the ones that were constantly like, "What's happening in the sprints? What didn't make it? Why didn't it?" Doing a lot of that work. And I think PMs are still responsible to keep track of that, but engineering managers are increasingly expected to be the ones that are actively making sure that sprint goals, for instance, are met. And that's a shift that I've seen recently that we do have to debate often.

Lenny (20:57):
I think one of the most interesting elements of this approach is that the product manager role is so I ill-defined and so different in every company, and so I imagine much of the benefit here is just what the hell is the PM's responsibility?

Nikita Miller (20:57):
100%.

Lenny (21:10):
Is there anything that you find is surprising about what teams end up taking off the PM's plate or putting on the plate that maybe other companies don't?

Nikita Miller (21:18):
I think a lot of people end up putting a lot on the PM's plate because of that misunderstanding. And so you end up looking at something as a group and saying, "Well, no one human can do all of those things all the time, so let's talk about what the shared responsibility looks like." And what I think is really powerful about the triad is that it's a recognition of there are shared responsibilities. Who's responsible for making sure that everyone understands what we're doing and why, the PM leads that, but evangelizing that is something that would be expected of designers and engineering managers and data scientists as well.

Lenny (21:57):
On the data scientist piece, you talked about how you're trying to embed that more and more into product teams. At Airbnb, data scientists were embedded in every team, so I totally get that.

Nikita Miller (22:05):
It's not everywhere.

Lenny (22:07):
Yeah, exactly. What more can you share there of just why you found that to be important and how you're approaching that?

Nikita Miller (22:13):
From my experience as a product manager, it was always a blocker. Getting your hands on the data, maybe having someone to troubleshoot with if as a PM you couldn't kind of understand or figure it out yourself, it was just always a blocker. And so then you'd also then have to go and negotiate with other teams about getting someone's resources to look at this problem, so that's one. The other is just that data scientists, as with most humans, we get better the more focused we are and the more in depth we are in understanding the product itself. So if you have someone that's dedicated to a zone or an area of the product, then it's much easier for them to spot patterns as opposed to attempting to understand what's happening every time a ticket comes in.

Lenny (22:58):
And so the shift you push for is instead of a centralized data team that you convince to give you resources, you embed the data scientist into the team.

Nikita Miller (22:58):
Right.

Lenny (23:07):
And do you call them data scientists, do you call them analysts? How do you think about that?

Nikita Miller (23:11):
That also varies per company. That depends on the organization and the work. Some teams require data scientists, not all. Some require analysts, so that just depends on what the team's working on, what's needed.

Lenny (23:27):
Got it. Coming back to the roles and responsibilities framework, do you encourage teams to revisit that every once in a while or is it like this team's done this thing and we're good for a while?

Nikita Miller (23:36):
I encourage them to revisit it and it's usually because something's fallen off the rails. I think if they were really great at it, I'd say every three months or every six months, let's have a look and see how this is going. But often it happens because there's some conflict or tension or something was missed and someone thought it was theirs or not and we have to do a quick retro.

Lenny (23:59):
What do you find is often that thing that is maybe missed or often causes tension?

Nikita Miller (24:04):
Execution. It's usually around execution and velocity.

Lenny (24:10):
Not moving fast enough?

Nikita Miller (24:11):
Not moving fast enough.

Lenny (24:13):
What do you find often is a way to help with that as a leader of teams?

Nikita Miller (24:18):
Well, one, just identifying what the velocity issue is. It can vary, so for PMs it's often around the velocity of decision-making. How long does it take us actually from saying we need to do a thing to defining it potentially, and then deciding are we actually going to do it or how? And that I think takes a long time for most companies, most people. So velocity of decision-making, so I think that tends to fall on the PM most often. The actual execution of it, the development tends to fall on both PM and engineering. So in engineering I find that depending on the org, some folks understand breaking up tickets into small pieces and why that's valuable and how to do it, and that's something that I think everyone in industry probably needs a refresher on, why that's valuable and how it works. And some of that is also shared by the PM because if you haven't articulated clearly or well enough what we're trying to do, then it is hard to break that apart. So those are the two things that are on my mind a lot.

Lenny (25:27):
Is there anything else along the lines of what you've learned about building successful teams? I really love this roles and responsibilities approach.

Nikita Miller (25:35):
Outcomes and output also comes up a lot, and many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. 

(26:10):
So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much. So that conversation is one that I think we often have to revisit on all the teams I've ever been on that yes, outcomes are important, but also the indicator is around execution and velocity. So if that's not in line, then a lot of the other things don't matter that much.

Lenny (26:50):
And so when you say outcome, you're saying here's the goal they're achieving or the impact they're having, or is it just the idea we know what our outcome will be but they're not actually shipping anything? When you say output and outcome, what are you referring to specifically?

Nikita Miller (27:04):
The outcomes are understanding what the goals are and what we might do to get there. So OKRs is one way to talk about that. Great. But embedded in that is and how are we going to get there? And the fact is, the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right. So we're not actively monitoring how fast does it take us to ship things to market.

Lenny (27:28):
I see. So if I can rephrase it, a lot of teams know and talk about what they should be doing. They have a strategy, they have a goal, but what you're finding is that there's just not a lot of action a lot of times and there's a huge opportunity just to get a team to actually ship more often and move faster.

Nikita Miller (27:46):
Yeah. There's not a lot of understanding of our role and urgency. It's urgent, and software in particular. You probably can't forget that because someone else is likely doing something similar or better and faster.

Lenny (28:02):
Makes me think of I think Frank Slootman is his name, the Snowflake CEO. He wrote this book called Amp It Up, where he talks about how to build thriving software companies and businesses in general. One of his three most important recommendations is always have urgency, to never let off the gas of urgency. That things always need to feel urgent.

Nikita Miller (28:22):
I'll check that out. But I think product managers, I consider product to be the ones that really need to drive urgency.

Lenny (28:33):
Say more about that. What have you found helps in creating that sense of urgency and continuing to increase output?

Nikita Miller (28:39):
Mostly reminding people often. And I don't think that's a question of, "Well, show me list of everything you ship. That's never going to work." Well, that doesn't make people feel good about the work that they're doing, but let's talk about our experimentation backlog. What do we have in there? How quickly are we getting those things out? Those are the kind of conversations that I think help. I think that having a good pulse on competition helps as just a friendly reminder that there are others out there doing this and thinking about things very similarly, possibly, to how we're thinking about it, so how do we differentiate ourselves? And a lot of that is about how quickly are we getting many ideas to market? Small tangent. The competition side is interesting to me because I've worked at a few companies where I've worked with founders who are like, "We don't have competition, we're the only ones doing this," and then fast forward a few years and you're like, "Here are all the companies that were your competition that you didn't recognize then that are shipping great product now."

Lenny (29:52):
This might be a tough question, but I think there's always a sense of we can move faster. It's rare that no, we're moving fast as we can. Do you have any kind of heuristic or I don't know, gut feeling of knowing and sensing where this team's doing fine versus this team isn't moving as fast as they can?

Nikita Miller (30:09):
How much time do we spend on what I'd consider optimizations versus bigger bets, and how long does does it take for that to happen? Right? Because you know you've talked to the folks or been in the companies where you talk about something that by most measures is pretty simple. Someone goes heads down for a week or two and gets it done and you talk about it and then two quarters later, someone mentions it again and you're like, "Oh, okay. So what are all the things we did in between that time to now why that seemingly simple thing didn't get done?" And I think that's hard to say as a product manager because everything we do is all about prioritization, and I'm sure there are a bunch of other things that were prioritized, but they're these little things that come up periodically, or bug fixes. Something is broken. How long does it take us to recognize it and actually fix it?

Lenny (31:03):
Do you have a heuristic, speaking of big bets versus optimizations, of just how much time/resources to put into each bucket?

Nikita Miller (31:11):
Unfortunately, the answer is it depends. If you're working on a business that is 30 years old and has many acquisitions, it is very different from a startup or a growth stage company.I think it just varies.

Lenny (31:27):
Yep. That's often what I find. One last question along these lines that was on my mind as you were chatting. When you're finding that a team is not delivering as much output as you would think, what have you found works in helping them recognize that and not get defensive and not have all these excuses for why it's happening, just help them see what you see?

Nikita Miller (31:46):
I'll tell you what I do. I don't know, I think folks might get defensive sometime.

Lenny (31:52):
Yeah, I think.

Nikita Miller (31:53):
But I'll tell you what I try. For me the biggest thing is just if folks are working on a sprint, it's very simply, "What did you deliver this sprint?" That's it.

Lenny (32:04):
Just asking questions.

Nikita Miller (32:05):
Just ask a bunch of questions. "What did you deliver?" And more questions, "Okay, fine, but what did you deliver to production? Great. And how long have you been working on that? How long? What was the cycle time?" So these questions that are really just I think seeking to understand because I understand complexity and so that exists everywhere, but maybe helping folks see that as they're reviewing their own work or their team's work goes a long way.

Lenny (32:35):
And it comes back to your approach of just focus on the output, not what they're planning to do, what they've actually done. This episode is brought to you by Ahrefs.

Shifting a little bit, you've been a PM for a long time, since 2010 I believe, and a lot of people move out of pm and so it's really cool to talk to someone that's been in the field for a while. What have you seen in terms of how product maybe has changed? The role of product management, the role of product leadership, and also maybe other functions like designer engineering?

Nikita Miller (33:51):
I think the biggest change for product at macro is how mainstream it is. I still find fascinating getting degrees in product management and going to business school to transition into product management and the whole discipline. And there's a whole business, honestly, around the business of product management, which I find really fascinating and it didn't exist. And I think for better or worse, that comes with a lot of good and in some ways might have removed some of the quirkiness and creativity that probably is required of product, but that's probably a different podcast. So that's one, just macro. In terms of the roles, I think that what we were talking before about roles and responsibilities and defining those for product managers, I think product managers are increasingly I think a bit more technical or expected to be. I think there was a moment where they were technical and then it was, "No, no, we're all generalists," and now I think we're going back to PMs need to be more technical.

(34:54):
I think designers, the expectation is that they'll be more business-oriented, design as a means, honestly, to an end. I think that's trending and probably for the better. I think the best designers I've ever worked with are also exceptionally savvy business people. And I think engineers are increasingly becoming what more product-focused, more user-focused. So product engineers is something Trello I think did really well. This idea that great ideas can come from anywhere in the org at any function I think is really magical. So as you're seeing PM's becoming more technical, I think designers becoming more business-oriented, engineers are becoming a lot more product/user-focused, to me that's amazing because it means that we're getting closer to what I'd consider really deep collaboration. And it's not to say that we're not experts. There are expertise within that that we expect of folks, but that care for other disciplines I think is where a lot of magic happens.

Lenny (35:57):
That's really interesting. When you say PMs  getting more technical, when you're hiring, interviewing, what are you looking for? Do PMs need to learn to code? How technical do you find they need to be?

Nikita Miller (36:08):
I don't think so, necessarily. I think a lot more PMs are. A lot more PMs are taking boot camps or coding classes, which I think is all to the good. I don't know that it's a requirement, but there is more of that and I think is very helpful. Similarly, a lot more PMs are taking more classes or digging more into data analysis, also really valuable. I don't think it's a requirement. I am not a technical PM, I don't have a tech background. I think I've been doing it long enough at this point to do okay, but I think it's a benefit.

Lenny (36:42):
You said that the PM is becoming more of just a thing with training classes and courses like that? 

Nikita Miller (36:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (36:48):
I did a search once on LinkedIn for how many product managers there are. Guess many PMs there are in the world, that have the title PM in their LinkedIn profile?

Nikita Miller (36:57):
A lot. I'm guessing a lot.

Lenny (36:59):
2 million.

Nikita Miller (37:01):
That's wild. 

Lenny (37:02):
That's wild. And there's 800,000 just in the US.

Nikita Miller (37:05):
Wow. 

Lenny (37:06):
That's a large group that I didn't expect.

Nikita Miller (37:10):
Back in my EdTech days, a friend of mine, her kids were in school and she came in one day, her son was in grade school at the time, in elementary school and he had this match to what careers, what you see, and they had a person at a computer, this image, and it was product manager. There was an option for product manager. And that's when I knew, I was like, "Okay, this is mainstream. We're about to become consultants."

Lenny (37:37):
I always used to joke, no one grows up and is like, "I want to be a product manager when I grow up," but I think that's starting to-

Nikita Miller (37:41):
It's a starting. It's a thing.

Lenny (37:45):
While we're on that topic, I imagine people often ask you for advice on how to get into product management. Do you have any advice there for folks that are listening that maybe want to get into that?

Nikita Miller (37:54):
There are many ways now. I think there are a lot of the typical programs that a lot of the big tech companies have, I think is one way. I think getting into startups as a product manager is a pretty awesome way to get into product because it's just a lot of problem-solving. The problem with that is you don't have anyone to teach you the right way, but the product will teach you the right and wrong way if you're with a team that is moving quickly. I still think working on smaller products and companies is a way great way to get into product management in part because you'll get to touch all of the functions that are required parts of the product discipline, and I think it's hard to get that experience otherwise.

Lenny (38:40):
The PM role, we haven't talked about this, it's just very hard and very stressful and mostly sucks in many ways. 

Nikita Miller (38:48):
Yes.

Lenny (38:48):
And we could talk about that if you want, but it was more of a segue to work-life balance, which I know you have some strong opinions about. So I don't know, you could take it either direction, but just thoughts on work-life balance/how hard the PM role is.

Nikita Miller (39:01):
The PM role is really hard. I feel especially now that I'm managing a lot of teams and PMs at a lot of different levels, I do find that periodically I remind them with the core of my being that, "I know this is hard." It is hard. There are a lot of expectations. You're expected to be competent across many areas all the time, you're expected to have an answer and you're expected to keep your calm and not lose your shit, and that's really hard. It just is. It's stressful. So I think I spend quite a bit of time with my team, my PMs, helping them understand that I understand that. And so when we're problem-solving, let's probably not solve for everything. Let's focus on one of many things that are expected. It's really hard. On work-life balance, as I mentioned to you I think about this a lot, I'm currently a mom and as you can imagine, that's a lot to manage at any given time.

(40:05):
And so recently, when I think about work-life balance, I don't use the word balance, I use optimization. It's this question of what are you optimizing for right now? Whether it's today or this court or this year, with the understanding that I don't think you can have it all at the same time all the time. And so I'm increasingly coming to peace with that. Where that's been interesting over the course of my career, I was chatting with my husband about this yesterday and was thinking about, early in my career I remember when we had big releases, folks would just work nonstop for a couple of weeks. We would stay in the office late, we would come in early. If it was international, we just probably wouldn't sleep because we wanted to make sure we QA'd everything before we released it, and that was an expected part of the product development life cycle.

(40:55):
And that was a lot of my early product years and I just did it and it was very exciting and I quite enjoyed it, but even then, the flip side of it for me was I also was a runner back then, so if I was training for a half marathon or a marathon, then the next week I'd probably do my long run in the morning and not start work until 10:00 AM. That was my version of balance. And I think many of us are lucky enough, especially in tech, that a lot of companies get that form of flexibility. So now fast forward 13 years, it is very similar. I don't do all of the drop-offs and pickups for the kids, but there are some weeks where I'm like, "This is the week I'm going to do all of the drop-offs and pickups," or, "This is the day," and that's felt much healthier for me than this expectation that I'm somehow going to balance it all and everything is going to be equally great or cared for all the time.

Lenny (41:56):
I think what I'm hearing essentially, which I really like and agree with, is sometimes you're just going to have to go sprint and go hard and work really hard and go long hours and then that doesn't need to last forever. And then when it's not, enjoy that extra time and build and recharge and do the things you got to do.

Nikita Miller (42:18):
Yeah. That's about right.

Lenny (42:18):
I find the same thing. I find that just working hard is very correlated with success, and a lot of times that's just a lot of long hours and sometimes you can't balance it for periods of time.

Nikita Miller (42:30):
Right. And it can also be at different points in your life, right? So right now at this particular moment in my life, I'm probably not going to go hard at a super early stage startup because I believe that you probably need to be in person and working really hard together for long periods of time. And not everyone feel this way, I know that. I've had these conversations with lots of friends and colleagues. So personally for me, that's probably not the decision I would make at this moment in my life.

Lenny (43:02):
I get that. Another area I wanted to touch on is remote work and distributed work. I believe most of your career, you were remote or you worked with remote teams and distributed teams and that's such a on-trend thing now where a lot of teams are working hybrid, working remotely, working with distributed teams. What have you learned about being successful working with distributed and remote teams?

Nikita Miller (43:23):
Yes. My entire career has been with remote or distributed teams. That's right. When I started early my career, I lived abroad for a while. I lived in Shanghai. I had a core team there, but also worked for the distributed team in Europe and Latin America, which meant all kinds of crazy hours and lots of sprints like we just talked about. Things that worked well, one, documentation. It's a thing. Asynchronous communication, everyone just has to get used to it and better at it, so increasingly just being better communicators, whether it's on a video or written.

(44:00):
I think that's just really important, and everyone building up that muscle is really important. For all of the roles I've been in, this notion of what does it mean to have really meaningful and valuable in-person time that can sustain you for the remote and distributed time is a really important. I think a lot of what's happened now in COVID and even now, a lot of teams have never met their coworkers. They don't onboard in person, they don't have events or offsites as frequently. And I think flexibility is really great, but I think that really, that makes it really hard, and to me, what I've figured out I think is that it especially makes it hard to solve hard problems.

(44:43):
Solving a hard problem remotely with folks that you haven't spent in-person time with, that you haven't broken bread with, that you haven't disagreed with in person and built that trust is just really hard. In fact, it's much harder. So some of the things I've done even here at The Knot Worldwide is periodically when there's a really gnarly problem, I wave the flag and I say, "Hey everyone, why don't we try and get together for two days and hash some of this stuff out, and then we can go back to our remote lives?" And I think folks have been maybe unsurprisingly very open to that because I think they see not only the efficiency but the camaraderie that can happen there as opposed to what was happening potentially on a Hangouts or a Zoom call.

Lenny (45:28):
What does that event look like? Where do you do it? What's roughly an agenda?

Nikita Miller (45:32):
One, the agenda is pretty tight before we get there. Myself or someone else are responsible for making sure that that's a well-articulated agenda that we all kind of agree on before we even get there, so I think that's one. I think 48 hours, two nights, and that's important to me because it tends to still just be hours in a conference room or a meeting room during the day, but you do need to build in the, "And let's go have dinner since we're all in person anyway, or let's have an extended lunch and maybe an extended day." I think that's just really important. And even early in my career when I was working more internationally, the company I worked for was pretty amazing because two or three times a year, the entire company globally came together for a week or two and it made a huge difference, and many of the folks that I worked with there are still friends and mentors.

Lenny (46:29):
Are you able to share what was the challenge you're trying to overcome in one of these times? 

Nikita Miller (46:34):
I can speak about it generally, which was just we had a change in strategy and we needed to land a couple of core decisions about what we might build. And there were lots of documents and lots of conversations, and back to the velocity of decision-making, remotely that can be really hard because with time zones, someone sends a doc, you comment on it, you get to the other day by the end of the week. And so days and days have passed and we still haven't landed it, and people have really strong opinions obviously that's something that big, so it's like, "Nope. Okay, great. Wave the flag." And not everyone could make it. Most people could, and the folks who could not were, yes, on a screen.

Lenny (47:15):
Was there anything specific in that offsite that helped you get to a resolution?

Nikita Miller (47:21):
In that particular one, it was one, very cross-functional and the unlock there was giving the data person the space to educate all of us. That was it. It was like, "You have the floor, educate."

Lenny (47:40):
I find that's often the solution is people just don't have all the same information that they're basing their decision on, so make sure everyone starts with the same foundation. Awesome. And that comes back to your push to get data integrated into every team and make that part of the four quad triad.

Nikita Miller (47:57):
That chair. It's the chair.

Lenny (47:59):
Anything else around remote work or distributed work that you found to be incredibly impactful or important?

Nikita Miller (48:04):
Well, the flexibility of it that I'm sure you've talked about with others, that is really important. I do think that Trello and Atlassian did this really well, is having standards around a couple things. The biggest one I think was overlapping work hours. So everyone had general flexibility, but there were some set of hours where everyone needed to be online at the same time for the most part every day, and that made a big difference. Onboarding happened in person. I think that in-person onboarding for new folks is really important for everyone. For any new person to an organization, I think how we work culturally, having a contact that you can reach out to, all of that I think is really crucial. I'm definitely of the so much of my early learning was in person and I have no idea how we're going to replicate that in a non-office setting. It's just really hard.

Lenny (49:04):
How long do you try to have that person in the office for onboarding? Is it a week? Is it a few days?

Nikita Miller (49:09):
A week.

Lenny (49:09):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, just a few more questions. You mentioned you worked in China, you also worked in the UK for a while, obviously in the US now. What have you found to be some of the biggest differences in maybe the product culture or just culture in general working in these different areas?

Nikita Miller (49:26):
The confusion around what product management is is universal. That's not specific to US I think, and the fact that it's changing, that I think was the same. I don't know that I've found that many differences in terms of how we approached goal-setting, all very similar. The need for urgency, all those principles I think this are the same no matter where you are. Part of what I experienced when I started in Shanghai was the feeling that the product manager was expected to have all the answers, which as you can imagine was really overwhelming. And so I remember because I was young and I didn't know that much about product management, and I definitely did not have all the answers, I spent a lot of time helping the team help me get answers and that was a little bit of a culture shift in our team at the time. 

(50:25):
And I actually think that's kind of carried me through my entire career, which is trying to figure out how to share the product management load so we're equally responsible for what we're building. So that was a good unintentional learning that I think has been really important for my career. I think that part of that learning that I've had obviously here and in London as well was the figuring out how to make room for creativity. So in Shanghai and also in London at the time, this was a decade now so many things have changed since then, there just didn't seem to be as much room for ideas to come from anywhere, which I think is also related to what I've seen before. 

(51:13):
So making space for people across functions to share ideas and then across geographies to share ideas, especially in companies where English might have been the primary language but most of the employees were not native English speakers, there was a lot of time I think that I felt that I wanted to spend, and I did, on just creating space for people to comfortably share their ideas honestly. And that for me was really formative because I think it's really impacted how I've approached my entire career and I don't know that I would have, had I not had those experiences.

Lenny (51:52):
I was browsing through your LinkedIn post and you said something just like that on LinkedIn of just how formative that experience was for you. I know it's not something people can just say, "Hey, I'm going to go to China and work for a startup," but it sounds like you recommend working at companies of different cultures because it feels like it is a lens.

Nikita Miller (52:10):
Yeah. I do. I also think my family, I'm Jamaican, I'm a Jamaican immigrant, and so all of our experiences inform how we perform our jobs and how we think about problems. And being able to expand that, yes, I would recommend it to every and anyone that gets the opportunity. And I think it's really important as product managers because I think it's really hard to be a product manager if you cannot empathize with the people and problems that you're solving for, and being out of your comfort obviously is one way to learn empathy.

Lenny (52:50):
I love that. One final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round, not to not count those questions. Are there just any frameworks or processes or methods that you found to be very valuable in your career as a product leader that you would want to share?

Nikita Miller (53:08):
The question I ask myself and I ask everyone in my life probably, whether it's on my team or when folks, friends talk to me, I always ask, "What are you optimizing for?" That's the question, it's what are you optimizing for? And it's the short, medium, lon-term in product, but it's what are you optimizing for today, this quarter, this year? Whatever time horizon. And I think that can be just a really illuminating way of thinking about obviously just how are you spending your time? And I think it works for product as well. Every time we talk about OKR or goal-setting, ultimately it is what are we optimizing for some period of time. And I think that always for me, whether personally or in product, is very illuminating.

Lenny (53:53):
I love that. I'm pretty sure I've asked that question 1,000 times myself. One thing I find though is people get annoyed with you just like, "Okay. You're such a PM."

Nikita Miller (54:02):
I know, but it works.

Lenny (54:05):
It does work. What are some instances where you deploy this question? Is it in a meeting where someone's asking a question where you're just like, "What are we optimizing for here?"

Nikita Miller (54:14):
I ask this question all the time. I ask this question to my husband. What are we optimizing for?

Lenny (54:17):
I'm sure he loves it.

Nikita Miller (54:19):
He was a PM too, so he gets it.

Lenny (54:20):
Okay, okay. That's helpful.

Nikita Miller (54:23):
I ask this to my five-year-old, honestly. We talk about it a lot. Now we're going to quarterly planning, all of us, and now we have information from Q1 so let's look at it and say, "Given what we know now, what are we optimizing for? Because it might not be the same thing we did before with new information or it may be," and that's usually just then helping us get better at figuring out obviously how we're doing trade-offs-

Lenny (54:55):
That's awesome.

Nikita Miller (54:56):
... because if the first point isn't clear, then the trade-offs aren't going to be clear.

Lenny (54:59):
Yep. The other question is what problem are we trying to solve here? I feel like I need to make mugs and put these some mugs for product managers. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Nikita Miller (55:13):
Yes. I don't think I prepped this, but I'm ready. Yes.

Lenny (55:16):
Okay. Well, it'll be the most fun then. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Nikita Miller (55:23):
These are not product books. I recommend Anna Akhmatova's You Will Hear Thunder, a book of poetry that is excellent. I recommend almost anything by James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time I most recently reread, and back to software, High Output Management.

Lenny (55:43):
What are some favorite movies or TV shows they've recently watched that you really enjoyed?

Nikita Miller (55:49):
I am really into K dramas right now, and actually-

Lenny (55:52):
Is that Korean?

Nikita Miller (55:53):
... Korean dramas right now. Crash Landing on You, it's great. It's a love story.

Lenny (56:01):
That's wonderful. Very out of the box. I love it. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Nikita Miller (56:08):
For product managers, we think about product in the context of artist, scientist, general manager. Where do you spike?

Lenny (56:15):
Artist, scientist, general manager. Interesting. And is there one you ideally look for the answer or it depends on the role you're hiring for?

Nikita Miller (56:23):
It totally depends on the composition of my team.

Lenny (56:26):
Interesting. Cool. I like that. And a different triad. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Nikita Miller (56:33):
Arc by The Browser Company. I think they're a product that's clearly having a lot of fun and you can feel that in the product. When I first opened it, they have an unveiling experience, which isn't something you'd expect of a browser, and there was something really delightful about it.

Lenny (56:51):
Yeah. I imagine you've heard the interview with Josh. 

Nikita Miller (56:55):
I did.

Lenny (56:55):
What a guy. What a cool product. I love it. We have a whole hour and a half on it, so check that out if anyone wants to learn more about Arc. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact in your team's ability to execute?

Nikita Miller (57:11):
Helping product teams try and use product, design, engineering and data to understand their shared roles and responsibilities.

Lenny (57:19):
Awesome. Call back to our previous discussion. And final question. What's a pro tip for someone trying to use The Knot and or one of the other properties?

Nikita Miller (57:29):
Ooh, good question. Two things, but the big one is probably checking out The Knot Worldwide marketplace. It is the most comprehensive two-sided marketplace to find your wedding vendors to create your wedding team, and you'll find that they're really cool small businesses on there.

Lenny (57:47):
Awesome. I'm going to go check that out. Nikita, thank you so much for being here. I'm going to go and ask my wife what she's optimizing for and read some stuff on the phone.

Nikita Miller (57:56):
Good luck.

Lenny (57:57):
Wish me luck.

Nikita Miller (57:58):
You said she's pregnant, right? She's optimizing for creating a human probably.

Lenny (58:02):
Yeah. That seems right. Okay. I'm not going to ask. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nikita Miller (58:13):
You? I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn, easy enough to find me. I am very responsive actually, or at least I try to be when folks reach out on anything product related. And ask me questions. I think that's always helpful. If you have other ways of doing things, I'd love to hear about it.

Lenny (58:29):
You mentioned also that you're doing some angel investing. Is there anything you're looking for specifically that you'd want people to ping you about?

Nikita Miller (58:35):
I am doing some angel investing, maybe a little bit less so recently, but I'm starting to ramp that up again. So if there are any early stage seed or pre-seed companies out there, you can ping me.

Lenny (58:47):
Amazing. Nikita, thank you again so much for being here.

Nikita Miller (58:50):
All right. Thanks a lot, Lenny.

Lenny (58:52):
Bye, everybody.

## Transcript

Nilan Peiris (00:00:00):
Some people focus on conversion rate, like, "I'm going to make this really, really slick." And that's cool. You get a bit more growth. But to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your user socks off. You have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's when you get it.

Lenny (00:00:23):

Nilan Peiris (00:03:32):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:33):
So you're chief product officer at Wise, which I don't know if you knew this, but I'm a very happy weekly active user of. To give folks a little bit of context on Wise, could you just explain, what does Wise do? And also share maybe a few stats to give people a sense of the scale that Wise has reached at this point.

Nilan Peiris (00:03:51):
We're looking to solve the problems associated with cross-border money movement, which is that moving money across border is pretty slow. It's actually really expensive, and it can be really hard to do. We solve it with three products, our money transfer product, which is what we started with, our account, which would be like, think of trying to solve the problems of international banking with our account for people, and for businesses. And then finally we've also got an enterprise product where we take the underlying infrastructure that's powered those products that we've built, and embed them in the banks, and products that people use every day, and then zooming into the numbers. So, we've got to come a little way on the journey. So today we're now moving about $12 billion a month, growing between 30 to 40% year on year. We take about 0.65% on average across all our routes as price, and we've been profitable for about more than four years now, with 20% EBITDA margins.

(00:05:05):
But probably the stat I'm most proud of, and the hardest thing to make happen out of all of that was we acquired 70% of the users that found out about Wise last month through word of mouth. So, contextually, we have 16 million customers, and we're acquiring about a million a quarter, about 10 million actives, and yes, so out of a million that joined Wise the first time, 700,000 found out about Wise from a friend.

Lenny (00:05:36):
There's a couple stats there that really stand out to me. One is you're gaining a million new users a quarter, which is insane. Just like a million new people joining Wise every quarter. That's an astounding number. The other number is what you just shared around word of mouth, that basically more than two thirds of people are discovering Wise and joining Wise through word of mouth. Mouth. I want to spend the bulk of our conversation on this topic of word of mouth. I think it's extremely rare how you've been able to increase word of mouth, and just how much of your growth comes through word of mouth.

(00:06:08):
You've essentially developed a system for how to drive word of mouth, and how to basically structure your team, your goals, your priorities and things like that in order to lean into this growth channel. And so, I just have a million questions around how you think about word of mouth, and the first is just, how do you measure word of mouth? How do you know that say, 70% of your growth is coming through word of mouth?

Nilan Peiris (00:06:28):
We ask customers, is the short answer. So, we have an attribution model, as you can imagine, and we've had one from the early days, and it overlays all the referrer data and cookie data you have on visits comes to the website. So you kind of know that. And then you obviously have the soundtrack stuff, and we sample, and ask customers a set of questions on this, and then overlay that onto the... What turns up in your web tracking as direct traffic to give us a sense of how big that word of mouth number is, and that's what gets us back to the 70% stat.

Lenny (00:07:05):
And very practically, how do you actually ask people? Is there a little pop-up on the website?

Nilan Peiris (00:07:09):
It's actually integrated into the flow. So when we built it originally, we thought it's quite cool, marketing and acquiring customers is part of the product, and we should actually stitch that into the experience seamlessly so that we're able to do this more effectively going forward.

Lenny (00:07:26):
That's actually, at Airbnb, exactly how the team did that, to understand what percentage of growth was word of mouth. It's just a little interstitial popup when you visit say, airbnb.com, "How'd you hear about us?" You think there's some fancy ways to understand the stuff, but it's just like, just ask people, they'll tell you how they heard about it.

Nilan Peiris (00:07:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:07:41):
Awesome. Okay, so just to kind of dig into the meat of it, what has been the biggest shift in helping you significantly grow word of mouth, and make it such a huge lever of growth for Wise?

Nilan Peiris (00:07:53):
Yeah, before I launch into this, let's just also take a step back, and why even focus on this? So in the early days, when I met the founders, Kristo and Tyler. It was quite funny, I got introed to them when they were just the founders, and without a team really, and with the beginnings of a product, and they said, "Nilan, you've got to meet these guys, they've got a great product, they just don't have any customers." And I sat there with them, and we kind of launched the first Google ads, and in the early days you try everything, hoping that something works. But taking a step back, think of money as the ultimate commodity. It's pretty hard to build an expensive business that moves your money somewhere, and it costs a lot, so there's less of it afterwards.

(00:08:48):
So building a brand led money transfer business, the brand's got to be pretty damn good, right? You're going to feel pretty special afterwards, in order to have less money afterwards. So what we're looking for always, but what channels out there are super scalable, and can reach our entire audience, but have an incredibly low distribution cost. So, that's one thing that led us to word of mouth and the other bit, when we get on to talk about marketing later, the other challenge with marketing which is unique is because we are lower price, but a superior product, we have less margin to spend on marketing than others in certain paid channels. So that's another reason why marketing is inherently hard. Our marketing team does amazing work at Wise, in order to work within those constraints.

(00:09:36):
But back to your question, which was like, what's the biggest thing we've done to shift word of mouth. When I joined Wise, and started wrangling with word of mouth, I spent a bunch of time with friends of mine in the US and around the world, Andrew Chen, some of the other growth gurus, this is going back 10, 12 years. It's like what mouths, who's done it? What's the system? What do you measure? There wasn't really anything out there. So we kind of had to figure our way out. So, first step was asking it, and the second step was kind of figure out how do you know what's driving it? And the best proxy we found for this was something that most people have heard of, that we actually used quite a lot is net promoter score.

(00:10:26):
So from the very early days we'd start asking customers, and you probably have seen this survey, "Would you recommend Wise to a friend?"

Lenny (00:10:34):
Never seen that ever in my life. Never been asked that question.

Nilan Peiris (00:10:39):
Exactly. There's [inaudible 00:10:41] you said. And then in the end you've got the scale, zero to 10, and the theory is nine to 10 there are promoters, and zero to seven are detractors. Zero to six, detractors, and seven to eight are kind of neutral on your product. The intriguing bet was when we overlaid this... So we have word of mouth, it's about 50 odd percent, and then we have a referral program. When we overlay the referral data over the NPS survey data, we saw something really interesting.

(00:11:13):
There's very low invite rates at one to six, and not just invite, conversion rates of users that joined for invites. But when we've got people from sixes to this seven and eight group, they doubled the number of people they told. Eight to nine, they doubled again, and nine to 10, they doubled again. So, this is pretty crazy when you see it for the first time. I'm going to get back to your question in a sec, but it's quite core buildup to it, because when you are a product manager, like you've been in your career, one of your jobs is to figure out what metric are you going to optimize for? What are you going to try to get the business to ground behind? And if you optimize for something like conversion, rate and you move conversion rate with 10%, you kind of get this one-off hit.

(00:12:00):
But if you move the NPS from 30% to 50%, you increase the viral coefficient of your customer base. So every customer that goes through tells X many more. When you model this through, the ROI on NPS increases is absolutely huge. So, it's got to say, "Okay, this is the thing to zoom in on, so how to move it?" So, then the second magic of NPS is you get the numbers, but you also get the comments underneath it. I remember in the first year we built the NPS survey, and we emailed out every week all the comments to the whole company, which was pretty small, and we kept doing that, I think up till about three or four years, everyone got the NPS comments.

(00:12:51):
And when you read the comments, and now obviously we've got all kinds of fancy models sitting on top of these things, customers kept telling us the same things, "Make it faster, make it cheaper, make it easier to use." Do you know at the beginning, when I said, "Price, speed, ease of use," we kind of figured this out by thinking hard about this question. How do we make this product so good that people will use, it but they'll recommend it?

(00:13:20):
And customers were pretty clear, the ones that were evangelical, is the word we use, are the ones that had a much... Had this cheaper experience, the ones that were talking about it had a fast experience. So it's about price, about speed, it's about ease of use. And when you generalize and take a step back, and look at consumer product companies, they have these product pillars they call it, and they usually have KPIs around them. The second insight we got, found, is when we entered markets, like when we entered the US for the first time, if we entered with a product that was priced at say 5.9%, and the alternative was six, customers would use us, but they wouldn't talk about us. We only got the advocacy when we were eight to 10 times cheaper. That's when people started talking about it.

Lenny (00:14:11):
Let me actually interrupt you here a bit, just to kind of set a little frame around this, because this is extremely interesting, and I think people may miss, I think, some of the really interesting insights here. What I'm hearing is essentially there's this clear sense that you had to grow through word of mouth because of the business model. You didn't make a lot of money per user, and you didn't have a lot of money to spend thus, to help grow. So essentially it's like. "How do we grow the word of mouth?" And then it's, "Okay, what do we need to convince people to share this product?" And used NPS, which I think a lot of people use, and also a lot of people probably know, "Let's make our product more awesome so that people talk about it." Those are kind of like, "Oh yeah, of course."

(00:14:49):
But I think what I'm hearing is that you did that's really unique, is one, you found this huge delta between these detractors, and even seven or... I guess it was six and below, and then seven or eight, and then nine, 10 kept kind of doubling. So one is just this focus on, how do we get someone from there to there? Two is this really big focus on the comments of the NPS survey, not just like, "Oh we have this percentage of detractors." And then also I love how you just create these pillars, essentially, of like, "We're going to work on these three things. These are the three levers to help grow word of mouth for this product." Does that sound about right?

Nilan Peiris (00:15:25):
That all makes sense. Obviously at the time, it is also way more chaotic.

Lenny (00:15:33):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:15:33):
So, at the beginning, everyone thinks it's 20 different things, and then over time, slowly, you understand that it's these things again and again. And a lot of building a successful businesses kind of building conviction that these are the things that matter. So, now I'd say price, speed, ease of use, it sounds... Like, but yeah, go back to seven, eight years. But we were arguing with each other around what, "Is it trust? Is it this? Is it this?" Trying to get clear on what are the things we missed there.

Lenny (00:16:00):
That would be useful actually to know. It sounds like, of course, it's going to be price and speed, but what are the things you kind of realize you don't need to focus on as much, based on these surveys?

Nilan Peiris (00:16:09):
Oh, wow, that's a really hard one. So, then the challenge, is as you know, everything is important.

Lenny (00:16:17):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:16:17):
Yeah? And that things that we use... We have a bucket called convenience. And inside the convenience bucket, there are many, many things hiding in there. And actually, you can measure this on contact rate, conversion rate, whatever, many different ways, and get many slightly different answers. So, I think I've learned there isn't... I haven't got a good answer on things we haven't-

Lenny (00:16:42):
Well, as you said, trust, which is interesting. Obviously trust matters, but maybe it sounds like-

Nilan Peiris (00:16:47):
Trust certainly matters. Yeah, trust's a good one. Let's talk about that one bit. I'll talk to you through the trust problem. So I ran into the trust problem hardest in marketing. So, just imagine, you just started out, you've got a money transfer company, it's good, your product's really good, it's really cheap. So, you put an ad out, and it says, "Move money with Wise, and really cheaply," is anyone going to click that? People did, right? Is anyone going to use it? Yeah, people did use it. And you did work all the usual trust elements. But the bit I found that really helped, the way I got my head around this, was what people trust is their friends. And this really was way stronger a trust signal than anything I could put on a landing page.

(00:17:40):
And even when people came in through marketing, they'd been told. So marketing can aid recall, and all kinds of things, because people are told by their friends. They'd have a use case later on, then Google, and like, "Ah, I remember, this guy used this." And we do definitely get users, especially today as we've got a larger brand, through marketing direct. But trust in isolation is a really hard problem to solve. You need to get under the skin of what it means. People don't think my money is safe. "I don't know if this company is reputable," to unpick each of these problems and figure out systemically how to solve them. And we've done this to some extent, but really there's a massive shortcut, which is if you deliver your customers a good experience, then figure out, how do you make it so good they'll recommend it? Then that kind of shortcut a lot of really hard trust problems.

Lenny (00:18:28):
What did you find most helped increase trust in that way? Is it just get more people using it and then they'll share with their friends, or is there something you did there to...

Nilan Peiris (00:18:36):
No, it was literally get more people using it, and they'll share with their friends. There's obviously a bunch of learnings we've had around what specific trust sentiments matter, especially geographically, but less powerful in the macro than get more people to use it.

(00:18:52):
So coming back to that, and I'd love to get your thoughts on this one. So, as you said, lots of people go up to NPS, and they kind of heard people talk about it, heard people talk about recommendations. So my learning on this is you've got to work really hard to get recommendation. So, to get a nine or a 10, so our NPS is 70%, so it's really, really high. So it's kind of higher than the iPhone, and Google search. So really, really high, so off the scale high.

(00:19:25):
And when we launch a market, or at the beginning it was much lower, so 20s and 30s. So instead it in context, like banks and financial services NPS is -30. So, most people don't recommend banks. So it's like, comes from a low base. But, what I've found is when you build a product, most founders, and most teams kind of stop when it works. As their next step, some people focus on conversion rate like, "I'm going to make this really, really slick," and that's cool, you get a bit more growth.

(00:20:02):
But to get to recommendation, you're going to blow your users' socks off, and the phrase we use is, you have to give them an experience they didn't know was previously possible. And when you are in that place of doing something that no one has ever done before, that's where you get it.

(00:20:24):
So the bar is all the way up there. And to put that in context, that means figuring out how to move money instantly. That means figuring out how to drop the price all the way from six all the way down to 0.35. And that's because there are systemic infrastructure issues in moving money around the world, which some people haven't solved before. And these problems are just really hard to solve. They take years to solve, but they have huge kind of returns when you do it.

Lenny (00:20:52):
I love that just as a framework, is how do... We need to blow our users' socks off. And again, it just comes back to how you can get people to want to share this product, and drive word of mouth, blow their socks off.

(00:21:02):
I want to dig into how you actually just figured out what these attributes are. Obviously you talked about this NPS survey highlighting things. How did you decide it was instant money movement, and some of the other things? Is it just basically looking at these survey results, and picking the things that come up most often?

Nilan Peiris (00:21:20):
Yeah, it was talking to customers, and looking at the survey results, and then through that, in many different ways, price will come up, speed will come up, ease of use will come up, and they kind of aggregate up to that.

Lenny (00:21:31):
I think a lot of people listening are still going to be this like, "Okay, we're just going to make our product awesome, and it's going to grow." And in a sense, yeah, in another sense what you're sharing is essentially kind of a really simple framework for how to actually do that. To kind of go a little deeper there, when you see other people trying to drive word of mouth, trying to drive virality, is there anything you think people often do wrong? Is there other missteps you've taken in trying to drive word of mouth?

Nilan Peiris (00:21:59):
It's this thing around growth rate. So, especially product net growth, which is what we're talking about. So you can imagine, we're going to open a new market to Indonesia, and the fastest way to do it is to take... Someone else has figured out how to move to Indonesia. We take that infrastructure, and we'll plug it into Wise,

(00:22:18):
You know what? We can do this, we'll get some users. But it doesn't grow like a hockey stick. It doesn't grow like a hockey stick because we haven't fundamentally changed the problems in moving money internationally. So, got this mantra, you've got to build a 10x better product than what's there. And if it's 10x product better, basically it doesn't exist already. So if you're plugging in something else, that's kind of a misstep.

(00:22:45):
So it comes from a very logical place, how do I get users quickly? I can take a shortcut in doing this, but that, you kind of realize is wasted effort. So the step then becomes this much harder question of these types of questions. Like what is the theoretical minimum cost for moving money into a market? What is the theoretical maximum speed? Not just make it instant, make it cheap, but what actually is the lowest it could possibly be? And instead of incrementally going, doing a jump to make it a little better, a little better, a little better, you can never get there. How do we take two years, and end up there?

Lenny (00:23:24):
I love that. It's something that I talk about a lot. Something I learned at Airbnb is this idea of working backwards from the ideal, instead of working forwards from how do we iterate and make this better, and better, and better. It's like, okay, if we could start again, and we could create the ideal experience, what would that look like? And then work backwards from what would it take to get there?

Nilan Peiris (00:23:44):
And what's an example of that at Airbnb? What was an ideal that you guys went for and then built?

Lenny (00:23:49):
The ideal was, there's this whole process where the founders hired this storyboard artist from Pixar to draw out the ideal experience of a host and a guest. So, there's these storyboards sitting in the office. I think there's 12 kind of... They call them key frames of, it's just like the booking experience being really seamless, arriving in the home, and being really amazed. Going out and finding things to do.

(00:24:13):
So, this became essentially the vision of the company is let's make each of these frames, these key moments of a journey for hosting a guest as incredible as possible. That was one, and that became essentially the strategy for a few years is just make each of these frames awesome.

(00:24:29):
And then there was another project that they were working on around booking at Airbnb. I don't know if you remember this, if you used Airbnb much, but most of Airbnb back in the day was you request to book with a host, you're like, "Hey, can I stay in your home?"

Nilan Peiris (00:24:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:42):
And turned out 50% of the time the guest was ignored, or rejected, and the host was just like, "Nah, no thank you." Now, over 80% as far as I know of bookings are instant bookings, where you just book and it's done, just like every other place you book online. And so that was a huge transition that I worked on, and that came from, if we were to start Airbnb again today, or if someone were to disrupt Airbnb, what would it look like? And obviously it'd be you just book. You're not sitting around hoping someone is cool with you. So, that came from that idea of just like, what would be the ideal Airbnb experience?

Nilan Peiris (00:25:15):
That is incredibly inspiring. I'll try and share a couple of stories, analogies from Wise. I'll talk about two things. Let's talk about price first. So, it's a good question. So, Moneytrans has been around since the [inaudible 00:25:32]. How does a few people get together? And it's evolved towards moving trillions around the world, and generally retail consumers paying about six to 7% around the world to do it. How do a small team in Europe start out and figure out how to move it? We launched at 0.5%, and now we're down to about 0.35%. So what changed?

Lenny (00:25:57):
Yeah, I was going to ask, how did you do that? That sounds like everyone would want to do that.

Nilan Peiris (00:26:02):
Yeah, so let's try to unpick it a little bit. So, first question you'd ask is, "I know what you're doing, you're losing money on every transfer." It's like, "Especially what you're doing," but we've been profitable for five years. And one of the magical things here was we're actually profitable in every transaction. So it's probably about four or five years ago, I led this project to start to pull together our pricing.

(00:26:30):
So, every month you get bills, and they turn up in your P&L, but every single bill we got, we allocated the cost back to the customer, or the transaction that generated it. And then we add our margin on top, and that's our price. And when you look at this and you analyze it, you'll find obviously there are 20% of customers generating 80% of the costs. And what you do is you get those 20%, you give them a raise, because they should cover their costs, and you drop the price to everyone else. And then the team works really hard on reducing these costs down, and then you move into a different segment in the market as the price costs come down. Does that make sense, Lenny?

Lenny (00:27:13):
Yeah. Essentially charge the heavier users more to counteract less frequent users. And essentially that drives word of mouth.

Nilan Peiris (00:27:22):
Totally, but it's down to this level of, if an Australian customer calls up asking, "Where is my transfer?" That cost of that call gets allocated back to the AUD/GBP route. If a Brazilian business needs like 20 documents in order to be verified before we can give them an account, the cost of verifying check those customers goes back there, so that at a very atomic level starts happening. So yeah, as you said, the more expensive customers end up paying what they cost.

Lenny (00:27:51):
And it sounds like the more expensive markets.

Nilan Peiris (00:27:55):
Indeed, and the more expensive, systemically expensive markets. But let's get to that. So, what are the costs? So if you look at our P&L, there's just three costs at transaction level. You've got people costs, you've got the cost of risk, realized risk, and then you've got partner fees.

(00:28:16):
And so if you've got this mission of moving the world's money for almost nothing, or zero, as close to zero as you can, you've got to invest as much of your cashflow in engineering to try to engineer away these three problems. So just to take them through briefly a bit, and remember, we're trying to do this 10 times better than anyone else. So how do you really change the experience on each of them?

(00:28:40):
I'll cover a couple with you. So let's do the risk one first. There's two risks we have. We have have FX risk, you come to Wise you see your rate, and then you may send us the money a little later. If you're moving a million dollars, you can't usually move it instantly. It might take you two to three days to move it. The rate's locked, could move against us, we'd lose some money.

(00:29:01):
So that cost, if you look back, so we've halved that cost over the last few years, and you can imagine through understanding the bits of the product, they generate exposure, and limiting it, and a bunch of algorithms behind that. But the more inspiring stuff is the people costs, and the partner costs, go through each of these one at a time.

(00:29:25):
So the people costs are our customer service team, operations teams. But I like to think of that as the cost of poor quality. So you bring up customer support if the products are clear, you hire lots of people in the back office. If you haven't automated it. We get like 20% improvement year on year as we're doing that. But come back to your question, how do you step change that? How do you do a 10x better experience?

(00:29:49):
I'll share with you a story from Singapore. It's quite a fun one. Because we went to Singapore about six, seven years ago, and [inaudible 00:29:58], we asked for a license. We had 20,000 people on the wait list, or so, saying, "Wise, please come to Singapore." And we went there, we asked the regular, "Hey, can you give us a license?" They gave us the license, but they said, "You have to physically meet every single customer."

Lenny (00:30:13):
Great.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:14):
Face-to-face. And this happens, this is... Remember, they're banks that people use. So people go into banks usually, and you get face-to-face verified when you open a bank account. We're like, "You don't need to do this in Australia, in the UK, in other countries around the world." They're like, "In Singapore, for your license, you need to do this." So we actually sent a small team out to Singapore, and we opened an office through [inaudible 00:30:43], and customers... You went through this really slick flow, and then you got invited in to come see the team.

Lenny (00:30:49):
Amazing.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:50):
And customers hated it, and it was really expensive, obviously.

Lenny (00:30:56):
Yeah.

Nilan Peiris (00:30:57):
But the magic was we got the customers not to complain to us, but to complain to the government. And it took a year of lobbying, and a year of building, doing something unscalable effectively, before we got the world's first EKYC license in Singapore. So you could take a selfie, picture of your ID, and then you could get verified.

(00:31:21):
And that's what I call a 10x better experience than anyone else in the market, and that led to advocacy and word of mouth off the back of it. And that loop of getting your customers to help was also one of the learnings of word of mouth.

Lenny (00:31:35):
Was the product team involved? Were you involved in that on the ground stuff? Or was it like [inaudible 00:31:40]?

Nilan Peiris (00:31:39):
Yeah, yeah. Generally when we go [inaudible 00:31:43], we're running cross-functional teams, but this is a verification team. The team actually would verify the docs when you sent it to us. They went out to Singapore, verified them onsite, face-to-face.

(00:31:54):
So the fun bit here is why would customers help a company? And this is one of the other learnings on word of mouth. The way I think about this is that there are the rational reasons why people recommend, which we've covered. But there's these emotional ones as well. Softer ones people would call brand. I prefer to call it on the mission.

(00:32:19):
So we do our mission, which is to make the world's money move instantly at the touch of a button, for almost nothing. It was a very personal thing, it was like an internal company thing, to think our customers cared about it. And then we rebranded like eight, nine years ago, our first rebrand, and we wrote our mission and sent it to our customers.

(00:32:41):
We got more new customers from that email being forwarded around than any other kind of marketing. And I show this when I talk at conferences. This email broke all the rules of marketing. It didn't have a call to action, it didn't have a button to sign up, it didn't have anything in it, but people just forwarded it around saying, "You should check out Wise."

(00:32:59):
And it's not all the customer base, but there was a proportion of the customer base that this resonated in. And I think it's the authenticity within which they could see that we were genuinely trying to.... Trying to bring the prices down was a scheme to help us grow faster, which is kind of where it started out, was actually genuinely because founders, they were really upset about how much it cost to money.

(00:33:27):
They found good ways to solve that problem, and they're still really passionate about solving that problem. And they could see that authenticity flows through the whole company, because we got a... When you look at Wise, we're full of people on visas, and immigrants, and people that have worked, and live around the world, and struggled with this problem, and are passionate about solving it. And so they wanted to help us solve it. So the second part of this word of mouth engine is for us, we managed to get this mission thing to work.

(00:33:53):
So somehow we emotionally connect our cause, and then I see going, taking a step back, getting 10x better on price is through our customers helping us do it, which gets us even cheaper, which then brings more customers, that then creates this flywheel that's spins around.

Lenny (00:34:11):
What a flywheel you guys have built. This reminds me of a lot of different things. One is you talked about how there's the reality of the things people need, and then there's this soft, fuzzy stuff that's harder to quantify. I actually is the framework just like that on that product I talked about of instant booking.

(00:34:27):
I kind of built a roadmap around the reality of what people actually need in order to feel comfortable, guests booking instantly. And then I call it the perception, what are their fears about letting guests book instantly? And there's a lot of work to just convince them, you think you're going to get all these guests that are really scary or whatever, but in reality it never happens. It's really rare something bad happens, and if it does, we're going to cover it.

(00:34:50):
So, I think that's a really cool framework when you're trying to get people to adopt something, is think about what do they actually need? And then how do you convince them of the things that are just in their head? And it sounds like the win there was kind of this sharing your mission and your values as a business.

Nilan Peiris (00:35:05):
Yeah, it just sounds, again very tweedy, right? Tweedy, like sounds very corporate, sounds like it's never going to work, but I think it's also... I mean, Airbnb, the authenticity is there. People are passionate about making that experience work for both sides of the marketplace. It's kind of clear. So, I'm kind of taking a step back, personally very passionate about customer-led growth, and how that turns into shareholder value.

(00:35:32):
So, taking a step back, where every business I've ever worked in, it's always got these two lists, a list of things to do for your customers, and then it's got a list of things to do to make money. And you generally do everything you need to do to make money, and you do two things with the customer list, and you go, "Customer led business." And then, neat thing about wise, and I'm pretty sure you'll see the same thing on Airbnb is, we just had one list, which is this list of things that you need to do to make customers happy, and it's prioritized by impact on the really hard things. And if you do these really hard things, they have an incredible impact for customers, but hence on your growth, and on your shareholder value.

Lenny (00:36:11):
That is really interesting. Airbnb is not quite like that. It's actually become more like that with a lot of just like, "Let's build awesome products and not focus on experiments as much." So that's really interesting that prioritization basically at Wise came from, "What are people telling us?" I guess let me ask actually, how did you know what the impact would be on customers? How did you decide? Is it frequency of how often people request it? Is it, "We need to lower the cost, and so we're just going to prioritize the things that will lower prices most?"

Nilan Peiris (00:36:37):
Definitely on the journey at the beginning, you are into split testing, right? Let's try to take apart a split test on price. So, you've systemically dropped the cost. Imagine we drop the cost. The question is, do we drop the price? Do we pass that all on to customers? And do we keep some of it? And split testing on the price thing, if the split test is going to mean you end up with more revenue, it means you drop the price by 10%, and there happened to be that day, more than 10% more customers in the market who, they saw the price at one pound, but they see the price at 90p, at 10% lower, and they're like, "I wasn't going to shift at buy at one pound but I'm going to buy it 90p."

(00:37:23):
So this is pretty hard to do this. This word around conviction is one I use a lot, where you build this conviction that price is what matters. And through this incremental split test, you will take a long time to go there, but at some point you kind of go, "Actually I've got enough conviction." So there's one kind of strategic bet at the heart of Wise. That is if we have the lowest cost platform, and it's really fast, and really high quality, the world's volume will switch to us. And just marginally getting there step by step by step, and trying to track the incremental return is actually slower. And there's a point that comes that you go, "I feel really comfortable investing in price. I feel comfortable investing in speed, because I know it's going to pay back, and not necessarily this month, but eventually it will, and I need to make gains on all three levers in order to get there." Does that make sense?

Lenny (00:38:13):
Yeah, absolutely. So essentially, in that track of work, instead of everything that you did to reduce price, there wasn't an experiment to see, "What impact does this have on growth, or revenue?" Instead, it's just, "We know reducing price is going to help us grow, and so we're just going to track how much we're cutting price." And that's essentially the goals, I imagine, were just cut the price by some amount, find a way to make it this much cheaper every, say, quarter, or year.

Nilan Peiris (00:38:37):
Yeah, that's it. You got it. And that conviction is core. That extends to our product management approach on the UX. So this is a great line for use internally, I'm sure you've heard it, "You can't split test your way to love." So, this experiment led product management approach, where you throw a bunch of things on the wall, and then you kind of see what sticks, and generally we don't advocate this. Obviously there's a bit of it that happens, but generally don't advocate it. Mainly because engineering is expensive, and you can actually figure out what matters to customers through other means. Some of the techniques we've talked, and build it.

(00:39:21):
There's a story I like to share. I had a product manager join our refer a friend team, viral growth team, and invite team, and after a quarter, I said, "So what are you going to build?" And he's like, "I'm going to test everything. I'm going to test the landing page, I'm going to test the subject line, I'm going to test the program so I don't know yet till run through all the tests, then I'm going to come back and tell you what I'm going to build."

(00:39:47):
I said, "You're not going to do this. I'm going to give you three weeks and you're going to pick one thing to change, but you're going to go talk to people, and get quantitative insights, and build your own gut feel around what matters, and then launch it, and submit, test it, and see if it works." But this thing of building conviction on what matters, and I watch how teams slowly build this and you need the data there to make sure it doesn't become a hubris, right? That enables you to make much bigger changes than just experimenting away, and it forces you to get clear on what actually is the problem to solve here, and how do I solve it really, really well? Does that make sense, Lenny, Do you disagree? It's a bit provocative there. Some people are pretty strong in the expert led approach.

Lenny (00:40:30):
No, there's many ways to do it. There's no right way, and it's working. So I'm not going to argue.

(00:40:35):
This episode is brought to you by Masterworks, the premier art investing platform, where some everyday investors have earned a 35% net return. Yes, a 35% net return alongside 16 other exits, including 10 and 17% net returns. Contemporary art has outpaced the S&P 500 by 136% over the last 27 years. Citibank and Deloitte have reported that contemporary art has performed well as an inflation hedge, and the appreciation is almost entirely uncorrelated to other financial markets. Even the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, has said it's one of the greatest stores of wealth internationally. However, there's never been a way to invest in it practically without spending millions. But now Masterworks allows almost anyone to invest in works by artists like Banksy, Basquiat, and Monet.

(00:41:22):
In fact, Masterworks latest exit just last month delivered another double-digit annualized net return for their investors since the New York Times first reported on them in 2019, they've grown to over 800,000 users, and had some new offerings sell out in literal minutes. But you get special access and can jump the wait list queue at masterworks.art/lenny. As with any investment, past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investing involves risk. See important regulations and disclosures and aggregate advisory performance masterworks.com/cv. Again for special access to skip the wait list, go to masterworks.art/lenny.

(00:42:00):
So, what I'm hearing essentially, the experimentation culture at Wise is instead of just run, test everything that you're thinking about, throw out a bunch of ideas and see how they go, it's more, "Let's just decide we believe in this idea, and let's go bigger there, and run an experiment. Maybe not even." Is that roughly how you think about it?

Nilan Peiris (00:42:18):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And is that something that you've seen yourself in practice elsewhere?

Lenny (00:42:23):
It's interesting how many parallels there are to Airbnb, because this is what Airbnb is doing now. There's been a shift recently, where instead of everything is very data experiment driven, it's very just like, "Let's build really great products that the founders are really excited about, and that the execs are hearing from people. Let's just build things that are awesome and launch them, and we believe things will grow." And Airbnb is doing great.

Nilan Peiris (00:42:47):
Yeah, the challenge of this is because it does become this risk thing of where it's like, okay, it's someone's opinion, so I think it's X, right? And everyone thinks they're kind of Steve Jobs type thing.

Lenny (00:43:00):
Yeah. That's right.

Nilan Peiris (00:43:01):
You have some way of using data to get this conviction, and show why this is what we should do, but try to learn how to build that faster CME, slight difference. So, it's less product managers or me saying, "Hey guys, I think it's X." It's generally data driven, and qualitative insights driven as well.

Lenny (00:43:23):
Personally, I would always index towards running experiments just to put this out there, but I think in this case, it makes sense, where you just know, "We need to do these three things, just make it cheaper, make it faster." You don't need to AB test every idea there. Probably the main downside of not testing everything is you may be hurting things along the way, and you may not know it.

Nilan Peiris (00:43:42):
I mean, yeah, so we definitely do... So you're right. But there's a very different thing to when you look at the... From a sample size perspective, you want to do a beta, and understand the negative impact. It's a holdout group that's smaller, than a test to get a significance. It's quite define the criteria to know whether something is breaking, is generally a different thing to say, is this a material result in a test? Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:09):
And along those lines, the other benefit of experimentation is you know the impact. And so, team members can understand, "Here's what I did this quarter, this year." How do you think about just like performance reviews, and people's impact, and that kind of thing?

Nilan Peiris (00:44:21):
Yeah, that's a good one. This one is definitely an ongoing debate. So, I generally ask teams what's their impact? So, every quarter, every team, what... [inaudible 00:44:29] or Kristo will ask, "What did you ship?" And I generally ask, "How many people used it? What was the impact on volume?" Et cetera. And we have analyst teams that can answer this either with pre-post analysis, all kinds of techniques, or all through split tests. We generally have this, the debate is where the analysis slows us down, and we wouldn't make a decision off the back of the analysis.

(00:44:54):
And then, this generally is what you said, where the team needs a validation, mainly for themselves, and maybe a little performance, but not too much. And so, there were ways in which you can maybe get some read on it that isn't quite as strong as a split test, which we'd use in these things. It's more just getting some... You can understand that people worried when you do split tests that slow down the release of something, but in order to get impact, if you know you're not going to roll it back, then okay, you should just roll it out, and try to reduce the need for that validation.

Lenny (00:45:31):
I think that there's an interesting correlation between products that grow through word of mouth, and less need to experiment with everything. Airbnb is also actually 70% of growth is word of mouth from the last stat that I heard. And then you think about all these social consumer apps, they mostly grow through people sharing with their friends, and a lot of them come from just the founder's intuition of what a great product's going to be. I think about Snapchat, and the recent mobile social apps. And so I think maybe there's something there about just as a founder, trusting your gut more often. But then it becomes difficult as you grow. You have to delegate, and then you have to trust people on your team making the right decisions. I guess, is there anything there that you've learned about just trusting individual product teams to make decisions that you can't for sure know are positive or negative without running experiments?

Nilan Peiris (00:46:23):
So, as I say, almost everything we do, we have some way of understanding the impact. So, that's always there. We definitely have things where the team does something where Kristo or I will say, "This is just crazy. There's no way they're going to use this." And then we have a culture where people are encouraged to do these things, if they believe in it.

Lenny (00:46:48):
Is there an example of that?

Nilan Peiris (00:46:49):
Yeah, a couple. So the one [inaudible 00:46:52] that my head of SEO always talks about is a currency converter. So, the Wise homepage is a pretty good currency converter. It's got a decent one on there. There's tons of traffic on currency converter. So, if you click Wise link, now it's a little bit hidden on send, it's there. It's pretty cool. Currency converter.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Oh I see it at the bottom there. Yeah, it's like [inaudible 00:47:13].

Nilan Peiris (00:47:14):
But if you Google currency converter, there's tons of traffic, and that converter on the Wise homepage obviously includes our price, and lets you sign up. And so, should we build a currency convertor? Should we try to capture this traffic? Is it more effective to try to push our own product there? And you can kind of understand why it was Kristo, actually not me, that was like, "This is a crazy idea." And the founder, and the SEO team went out and built it, and it's huge now, in terms of visits. I think we've got a currency convertor app out there. I think we've got [inaudible 00:47:51] out there, and yeah, people discover wise through that, as an example of off-topic traffic, but that's a good example of one of those things where yeah, the founder said, "No," or, "That's' a bad idea," and we kind of went ahead, and did it anyway.

Lenny (00:48:07):
Awesome. I'm just thinking about broadly all the things we've been talking about. There's a couple of things that were floating around in my head. One is, reminds me of Amazon, where Jeff Bezos realized there are things that are going to be always true with Amazon. People always want cheaper prices, they want faster shipping. And I think there's something else. And it feels like you guys found the same sort of thing. What are the three things people always want with a money transfer product? And let's just make those as incredible as possible, and in your eyes, make them 10 times better than what anyone else has out there.

Nilan Peiris (00:48:40):
Yeah, totally. The business one example is relevant, and use it a lot when we talk to investors in the market, [inaudible 00:48:49] public helps validate this low cost, cutting price story. What's interesting is what changed though. So we started with transfers, but we got to account, and then we got to enterprise. Just what changed was we realized with account, if you just have to move $10, you're not going to download an app and do it. If you do it once, you're just going to do it in your bank. And so, that was a little bit of the insight behind building the Wise account, and we kind of focused on, there's a real problem with international banking.

(00:49:22):
So, really good example is for businesses. So if you are a business, say, in... Say a business in Europe, you've got a customer in Australia, and you want to get paid, you send them an invoice in Euros, and someday, some money's going to turn up in your account, you're like, "I don't know." They paid you an AUD, it got changed by three banks on the way through. You don't know what it is. What you'd love to do is invoice them in AUD, and get AUD in your bank account. You might even have people who need to pay in AUD, so you have to call to keep it there. But to get an Australian bank account, I found out, you need to fly to Australia, you need to incorporate a business in Australia, you need to go to a bank with all those papers, and then they will give you an Australian bank account number.

Lenny (00:50:06):
Great.

Nilan Peiris (00:50:07):
So with Wise, you can get an Australian bank account number with three clicks. Anyone can, and any business can, and you get an Australian balance, and a US, and a UK, and a Swiss bank. And this is killer for businesses that receive money internationally. And then the next big jump we did, and for consumers, so there are plenty of people, if all your banking is in the US, you probably shouldn't use Wise, but if you're somebody who uses another currency a lot, then you probably should use us as your primary bank.

(00:50:37):
There's some people, for example, who live in one country and get paid in another currency, and this is... Wise is great as an account for managing that. And we found with that, we got about... As we launched the account in markets, it was about a 20 to 30% more volume, cross-border volume coming into Wise from that market. Just a good example of how, while it's not price, not speed, you could argue is kind of ease of use, but we had to evolve it in order to get to the next tranche of the market. Does that make sense, Lenny?

Lenny (00:51:07):
Absolutely. And it all just comes back from what would be the theoretical ideal situation for people transferring money, say from Australia. And what I'm hearing is just find all the little friction points that get in the way. In this case you're like, "Okay, we'll create you an Australian bank account, and you don't even worry about it."

Nilan Peiris (00:51:25):
Yeah, that's exactly it. And so now then you have all these other problems, because we've got about $12.5 billion in deposits now, which is like a time. And the next problem customers are at is, "I want a return." And we quite deliberately don't have a banking license. You have to figure out, how are we going to solve that? We now put customers money in government bonds, US bonds, and when you pay with your card, it dynamically sells those bonds. And that's how we give you an interest rate, in roundabout 5% right now, given where bond rates are.

Lenny (00:51:58):
Yeah, interest rates are quite high, for better or worse. Zooming out a little bit, for folks that are starting to... Their wheels are turning, they're like, "Okay, I want to think about word of mouth, driving word of mouth. I'm going to go look at my survey results. I'm going to figure out these pillars that are driving word of mouth. I'm going to think about how to make things 10 times better." Just broadly, for someone that's starting to approach this, what would you say to them? How should they approach this? Any major learnings at a higher level, of just how to drive word of mouth for a product?

Nilan Peiris (00:52:30):
I think it just comes back to talking to customers and this is the question we've kept coming back to. What would it take to make it 10x better? And then you get clear in your head what it would take, and then it's usually the thing that everyone's looked at before and thought, it's the thing that's impossible. One more example is on the partner side. So, rather than find a cheaper bank for a banking partner, you think, well, the cheapest banking partner is the central bank. And imagine you're a startup. How the hell do you get a bank account at the central bank?

(00:53:08):
But that kind of thinking, and we now have a bank account at the Bank of England, the National Bank of Singapore, Bank of Australia. And each of these was as hard as getting that face-to-face verification thing in Singapore. It took years of lobbying, and all kinds of stuff, in order to make it happen. But it's setting your goal all the way up there. That's what enables you to build a 10x better product. That's what gets you to the word of mouth. So, the first step is getting super clear on what's the problems that my customers are caring about, worrying about? And then once you're clear there, as you said, how can I solve that completely, and what's the best it could possibly be? And then the hard bit is figuring out how to move that.

Lenny (00:53:48):
A lot of these things you're talking about are just, they sound like they are either impossible, like no way we're going to achieve that, or really, really hard. And a lot of companies, and a lot of founders, teams are just like, "Okay, we're not ever going to create a bank here. We're not going to be able to create an Australian bank account for everyone." What is it about your culture, or approach to these problems that you think that's unique to Wise that's like, "No, we're going to spend three years figuring this out, because it's that important?"

Nilan Peiris (00:54:16):
I think it's two [inaudible 00:54:17]. So one is, definitely the founders have this philosophy that unless you're doing something hard and new, it's kind of a waste of time. So, I think that also kind of runs through the culture. So, it's quite a rude awakening when people join Wise, because they're like, "Okay, I'm going to come, and just play around with a few things." You're like, "No, actually, the culture of the product team is we're super incentivized to do the hard things, and that's what's rewarded."

(00:54:46):
And that's quite hard to create the air cover. You can imagine like then in the early days and months when growth was slow, and people turned on the money taps in marketing, and you're trying to keep focused and plugging your away up these hard things, it's quite hard also to get the management cover in order to let the teams keep doing this. And then it's also hard just to turn up to work and really keep... You can imagine being in Singapore, verifying customers face-to face, thinking, "This is going nowhere, this is going nowhere, this is going nowhere." And then suddenly it changes. So that's what progress very much feels like at Wise. And we try to recognize that, and create a culture that enables that.

Lenny (00:55:21):
It feels like there's also just a lot of patience for these things. There isn't like, "We need to hit this quarterly goal. Why aren't we creating banks in Singapore yet?"

Nilan Peiris (00:55:29):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:55:31):
Awesome. The other kind of metaphor that's rolling around my head is something Seth Godin talks about. I don't know if you've heard of this guy, he's a marketing guru, and he has this concept that you want to build something that's remarkable, because if something is remarkable, it'll spread. And if you think about the word remarkable, it's something worth remarking about, which essentially is word of mouth.

Nilan Peiris (00:55:49):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:49):
And so that's his kind of mission and his, I don't know, advice to people is build something remarkable, something people will want to remark about. And clearly, you all have been doing that. And that's actually a good segue to where I wanted to go, which is around how you structure your team, and how you incentivize the team, organize teams, to achieve all these sorts of things. So, maybe just broadly, is there something unique to how you think about work structure, incentives, goals, things like that, in order to achieve these really hard things?

Nilan Peiris (00:56:17):
There's two unique lenses on this. One is in the macro-structure and one is in the micro-structure. So at the macro level, if you look at actually international banks, they don't really exist. I'm not sure if you've moved around between countries, but say you open a bank account with Citibank in the US, and then you go to Citibank in the UK, your Citibank account doesn't exist in the UK. You have to go to Citibank in the UK, and open a Citibank account. And actually, turns out, with some of these banks, to move money between your bank accounts is an international transfer. It's crazy.

(00:56:53):
So, when you take a step back, and look at how the market looks, you have at one end, international banks which are local tech stacks. So there's a core banking system in the US, and one in the UK, and one in Europe, say for Citibank, or for HSBC, but they have deep local integrations, so they're directly integrated in the payment system. Citibank in the US has got relationships, say, with the Federal Reserve, et cetera.

(00:57:20):
Other end of the spectrum you've got something like PayPal. So it's a tech company, it's got a single global tech stack. It doesn't run a additional version of PayPal in Australia than to the US, but it doesn't have deep connections. It hasn't got five central bank accounts, it hasn't got any of that. And I'd like to think of in the middle, you've got Wise, where we have a single global tech stack, and we have deep local infrastructure.

(00:57:45):
Now, from a technological perspective, just take a step back and think through this. This is actually non-trivial to figure out how to design. So, let's take something like the onboarding flow. So, we have global product teams, one part of product teams called global product teams. So we have a single onboarding flow that will give you a Wise account, and it's the same code that runs, whether you are in Brazil, New York, or Australia.

(00:58:17):
The regulation in Australia and Brazil is really different, and it isn't black and white in any country. So, there's a bunch of... You get a bunch of things you just shouldn't do in terms of letting people get so [inaudible 00:58:31] people who shouldn't get access to accounts. And then you can need to check these people aren't using it, and different jurisdictions have completely different requirements. Example is Japan, you have to take a picture of that front of the ID, the back of the ID, and the side of your ID. It's the only country in the world that you have to do this.

Lenny (00:58:47):
Wow.

Nilan Peiris (00:58:48):
And imagine you're the product manager for onboarding, and someone tells you, "Design the onboarding flow to give somebody a bank..." Just imagine gathering all the requirements from every country in the world, because there's very little similarity. You can't just say, "I take the US," and copy it somewhere else. It's very, very, very different.

(00:59:05):
It'd take forever to try to get that, and then normalize that into the main model, and try to figure out how you're going to structure the data around this. So, it then becomes like, what is the organization structure that enables us to discover what the domain model, let's call it that, for the onboarding flow should look like. And you end up with a global product team that owns overall KPIs around conversion rate, et cetera. And you have local, regional teams that own the conversion rate, and the cost to do KYC for their market, and they contribute to the global product code base.

(00:59:44):
So we have weak product ownership, where anyone can make code change, and pull requests, and these guys owning the vision in the center. But the only way that vision can evolve is by getting the feedback from these guys in the market, as they're constantly pushing stuff forward. And through that process, artifacts start emerging, where other markets are like Japan, and so you start splitting off that, and creating subtypes for it, and slowly the model emerges from there.

(01:00:09):
And so with this structure, the thing to optimize for is a really hard one. That problem that every global business has, is how do you get this collaboration to work between the local and the global? But unlike every other business, most businesses solve this probably as you know, is you usually have the US, and then you have international. And international is usually a bump site, where everyone's arguing to get their thing prioritized, right?

Lenny (01:00:29):
That's right.

Nilan Peiris (01:00:30):
Whereas here, you're kind of letting the local teams commit directly to the code base, and then this global team's got this challenge of doing this, and we over time create sub-teams around parts of the regionalization of the structure, around different objects as they emerge. But that broadly speaking is the first problem, the global problem. And the other bit with us is this is quite unique to us, because most fintechs out there are usually in one market. Like you take Robin Hood, it was in the US, it came to the UK, they went back to the US. You take Monzo, only the UK, N26 only in Europe, Up in Australia, China, and the US. And that's because their home markets are so big, and one regulator is a ton of work to manage. And the second complexity we have is we have all of these markets we have to be in, because we're international by default. So a lot of our thinking is where do we take that, turn that into competitive advantage, and which customer base really needs that? Which is what zooms us into that positioning on the international account.

Lenny (01:01:32):
It just comes back to again, and again, again and again, doing the hard thing, knocking peoples' socks off, and it feels like that's the formula for Wise.

Nilan Peiris (01:01:41):
I think yeah, you more or less got it. So that's one bit on structure. So this global local thing, and the second one has been a bit more of a journey. So when we started early on, we ran in autonomous independent teams, all focused on KPIs, and these KPIs rolled up to make it cheaper, make it faster, make it easier to use. You can imagine like a KPI tree, and teams around bits of their KPIs, and every quarter they talk through how they move their KPI, et cetera, and this kind of worked. And the way we ran our planning is, every quarter every team would stand up and talk through its plan, get feedback from other teams, and then move on. This worked till we got to 30 teams, and then you go from doing this in the afternoon, to doing it in two days and it's just like whoa.

(01:02:27):
So, we started heading towards the Spotify model, where we group the teams in squads, and into tribes. Today, I think that autonomy is at the squad level. So the squads are around products. So, we'll have a Wise account squad, a business squad, a Wise platform, our enterprise product squad, you'll have a North Am squad that looks after the North American product, and Lat Am squad, et cetera. And then financial crime fighting, et cetera.

(01:02:57):
And inside those squads you've got the teams, and the squad... Imagine you're the director for the Wise account, but you don't have a vision for the account. You've got to say where it's going. You've got to keep your teams on track against it. The teams aren't off doing whatever they want. They kind of need to be on track, versus the overall vision, and you're accountable for the results of that squad. And squads are in tribes, the tribe provides overall leadership, and a slight, light touch strategy on the squads. And that's more or less our structure, and how we've evolved towards it.

Lenny (01:03:26):
Is there anything else along the word of mouth concept that you think would be useful for people to share? Either how you think about it, team structure, anything else?

Nilan Peiris (01:03:34):
There's one tiny bit I'll share, which was around marketing and referral. This was super interesting for me. So, we've been running it, like Airbnb, we've been running referral program for now 12 years, and after 12 years, you've kind of tested everything anyway. And like I said, by this point you have literally tested everything. So when somebody comes up with something that has a 300% increase, you're like, "Whoa, that's super interesting. What just happened?"

Lenny (01:04:03):
Wow, I'm excited for this.

Nilan Peiris (01:04:05):
And yeah, I'll share this one, because it's interesting. So we run many variants of refer a friend, where you'll get different kinds of benefit. We tried chocolate, we tried money, we've tried $200, $500, $10, you get some, I get some money, all kinds of things. More or less headed towards three for $100, generally it's a sweet spot. Anyway, it's a pretty creative PM there. And he was again talking to customers, and he spotted this thing, which is pretty cool, which is when you do a transfer with Wise, at the end you get this email, the email says, "Well done." Then it says, "Your money's there in the other person's account, and you saved $10 on this transfer." And he got this insight, which was pretty awesome, was he realized that people believed they saved money, but they didn't believe the number. And he then thought, what would it take to get them to believe the number?

Lenny (01:05:05):
That seems right.

Nilan Peiris (01:05:07):
And so the fun bit was the approach. So then him and a designer sat there and they sketched out an alternative email, and they went down to the coffee shop downstairs, and they showed it to people, and they said... Just asked them what they thought, and they kept iterating it until they got to a graph. And this graph is like this... When you go through a money transfer thing, it pops up in places, behind the compare button. And this graph shows with your bank, when you send, how much is in the rate hidden as... This is how much you're sending, this is how much they're taking in the rate in a fee, and this is how much you can see in the fee, because the fees are hidden in the rates with banks. And then this is with Wise.

(01:05:45):
And they iterate this graph to the point that people looked at like, "Oh my God, I'm never using my bank again. This number... This is crazy." And then they put this graph on the success page when you did a transfer. Saying, "You saved this." And put a share button in there, and invite your friends button, and that's what really drove it. And when you fast-forward to today, we've now got... So it's actually quite hard. So, we now have I think about 70 bank accounts around the world. So, I think the top three accounts, banks in the world, where we log onto every day, and then we log the price and the quote for a bunch of different routes into a file. You can imagine how hard is. I think I personally have about 17 of these still in my name, that I've opened up around the world to help the team get going. But that's kind of one of the biggest word of mouth growth, or referral insights. I've got to this comparison thing, made into our marketing, made into our homepage, just went everywhere up from that insight.

Lenny (01:06:46):
And you said that that like 3x'd the sharing rate?

Nilan Peiris (01:06:50):
Yeah, that 3x'd the sharing rate. So we always had the share button after you completed a transfer. But putting that there with this graph, and that kind of got me to this, I'm curious on your take on this, on this definition of product marketing, where customers use the product, and they think they got this value, but when they actually know the value they get. So we got this on speed as well, where we're doing instant transfers, and customers wouldn't know it was instant.

(01:07:21):
So when you get an instant transfer, there's like this wizzy animation at the end, and you kind of know the money's in the other person's account, ready to spend. And again, you see this big jump in referral rate when that happens, but people need to know it's happened. And closing this delta between what you've done, and what's perceived to be done is what I call product marketing within the product. And that in its own right is a discipline, I've learned.

Lenny (01:07:43):
That's an awesome insight. It comes back to this framework we talked about of reality and perception, in a flip way, instead of getting people to adopt something, it's to appreciate the work you've done to make it remarkable, to make them understand how remarkable it really is.

Nilan Peiris (01:07:56):
Yeah, that was it. And that's something I'm continuously learning about yeah, as we go, as well.

Lenny (01:08:01):
That is extremely interesting. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I know you also do a bunch of charity work, and I wanted to give you a chance to share what you're doing there.

Nilan Peiris (01:08:12):
Thanks, Lenny. So, less charity, essentially came out of angel investing, is probably the way to say it. So I invest in startups, generally fintechs, mission led founders, word of mouth type stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about, that I'm passionate about. It is less investing, more helping, and yeah, just getting through the angel route. And then over time, I realized the thing I'm most passionate about is market failures. So generally I find that the invisible hand means most human needs get fulfilled by the market, but there are a few things that don't, and there's a couple of exciting startups out there who work really hard in this space. A couple are Beam in the UK, working on homelessness, Affinity and Neobank in Ghana. And so, this type of thing is stuff I'm most passionate about. So, if any of your listeners out there know anyone doing anything of that kind, trying to solve these kinds of hard problems, definitely reach out, always keen to talk.

Lenny (01:09:14):
Awesome. And we'll link to those two you mentioned in the show notes just in case people want to check them out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nilan Peiris (01:09:22):
Let's go for it.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Nilan Peiris (01:09:29):
Two, one's at the other ends of the spectrum. So one is... This sounds terribly pretentious Crime and Punishment, and the other one is Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie. I read a lot, I'm very passionate about reading, fiction, mainly. I don't read... Nonfiction is too much like work. And so, I generally need to read before I go to bed to decompress my brain. It's generally escapist type stuff. But I'm curious what you think of this, but for me authors are people that create people with words.

(01:10:03):
Like you say artist is a good artists if it's... Makes a good likeness to somebody, but imagine that you create somebody with words, and that person feels real, so they have some insight into the human condition. And what's amazing is if you learn something about what it means to be human from reading that. So at that end of the scale, Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment, where this guy kills somebody, and it just eats him up. It's a pretty amazing book. It's not as heavy as it sounds, but books like that are pretty awesome. So, I recommend that a lot.

(01:10:37):
And the other end of the scale is sometimes you read a book and there's a single sentence where each word has been just stitched together, and it's like, again, a work of art, and there, Rushdie is probably the pinnacle for me, of Midnight's Children, which is about partition in India, which is pretty... Through a metaphor, it's pretty amazing.

Lenny (01:10:57):
It's a beautiful answer. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Nilan Peiris (01:11:02):
Oh gosh, I am not... I don't love [inaudible 01:11:05] got TV, but we had rented Barbie for the kids. That one, probably the last movie.

Lenny (01:11:12):
I just watched that too. So good.

Nilan Peiris (01:11:13):
Good.

Lenny (01:11:15):
You can actually stream it now. I don't know when this comes out, but it just-

Nilan Peiris (01:11:17):
Oh wow.

Lenny (01:11:18):
Yeah, you can watch it at home. But it's not cheap. I think it's like 20 bucks in the US.

Nilan Peiris (01:11:23):
Oh geez.

Lenny (01:11:24):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Nilan Peiris (01:11:28):
Yeah, so I only ask two. I got down to asking just two questions over time. The first one's probably my favorite, which is, what is it that most frustrates you about... Instead of why you're leaving, what frustrates you the most about where you're working right now? And this is as people always tell you why they want to join Wise, or join whatever company you're coming to, and that's not that interesting. But what's interesting, trying to figure out, is what they're running away from. And usually there's something broken there, that's really wound them up. But what's more interesting is they've been unable to fix it. And so, in asking this question, and probing, you kind of get quite good at getting a sense of what is their limit, what's the thing they found, and what did they get stuck with? And you kind of think, "Okay, you're going to run into that here every day, every week? Or... You should be fine." And that's kind of why I ask that question.

Lenny (01:12:24):
I love that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Nilan Peiris (01:12:29):
I recently switched to Arc Browser.

Lenny (01:12:29):
That's what I use.

Nilan Peiris (01:12:35):
And yeah, the onboarding flow was mind-blowingly good.

Lenny (01:12:37):
That's exactly how I felt. I had to tweet about it. It's like, [inaudible 01:12:41].

Nilan Peiris (01:12:40):
Yeah, I sent it to my onboarding team, and everyone. And what I loved about it is, it's clearly like if you could try to use Arc with the same way you use Chrome, you just get really frustrated. But if you use it the way they want you to use, it'd be amazing. So, for figuring out how to get people to engage with, you need to use this fundamentally differently. They manage to almost get me to use it the right way. Still struggling a little bit with it, but that I thought was really clever.

Lenny (01:13:12):
Awesome choice. We had Josh, the CEO of the Browser Company of New York, it's called, on the podcast. And if you're interested in learning about Arc's story, definitely check out that episode. All right, next question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat most to yourself, that you like to share? Anything come to mind?

Nilan Peiris (01:13:30):
The thing that defines success is the speed at which you pick yourself up.

Lenny (01:13:37):
I love that.

Nilan Peiris (01:13:37):
And that's the thing that I hold onto most, because you get knocked a lot, high growth company, and it's obviously quite... Obviously knocks you, when someone says no to an offer, when somebody leaves the company, when a product doesn't work as you think it should, when you get pushback from a partner. But yeah, if you lose four hours spinning around it, or you trying and figure out, "Okay, this happened, how do I move forward?" And just learning how to shorten that time has probably been one of the most important journeys for me.

Lenny (01:14:11):
That was an awesome answer. One final question, is there a fun cultural ritual at Wise that has stuck around for a while?

Nilan Peiris (01:14:20):
This one, my team would love to say. So, from the early days, we got everyone together from all around the world once a year. Oh, I actually did it twice a year. And the founders are from Estonia, and we have 5,000 people now, so we still have about 1,800 in Estonia. So it's cheaper to flavor on Estonia. So in the old days when it was winter, winter in Estonia is not fun, but summer in Estonia is amazing, and we still do this. And the funnest bit about this is, I have a side hustle, DJ, so I get to DJ there, and it's quite fun, and embarrassing for my kids because technically I've now DJ'd in other countries.

Lenny (01:15:03):
International DJ.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:05):
That's it. That's my side hustle.

Lenny (01:15:07):
Amazing.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:08):
That's how I introduced myself to my 17-year old's friends. So, yeah.

Lenny (01:15:12):
Do you have a DJ name? Is there... Can we check you out on Spotify?

Nilan Peiris (01:15:15):
No, no, you can't check me on Spotify or anything, but yeah, it's all private. [inaudible 01:15:19].

Lenny (01:15:19):
All right. Maybe Burning Man, you could see your performance next year.

Nilan Peiris (01:15:23):
Maybe.

Lenny (01:15:24):
Nilan, thank you so much for being here. We talked a lot about word of mouth. I feel like this episode is going to spread 100% through word of mouth. Can't wait for people to listen to it. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Nilan Peiris (01:15:37):
You can find me online on Twitter, nilanp, and always love to hear product feedback by email, by tweet, by LinkedIn. Generally by tweet is best, easiest for me to pick up, and my team to reach into directly. So, hit me up that way. And most useful for me, yeah, product feedback, and as I said, other people working on hard problems that need help, do reach out.

Lenny (01:16:03):
Amazing. Nilan, thank you so much for being here.

Nilan Peiris (01:16:06):
Thank you for your time. Take care, Lenny.

I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection. And then I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff. And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions.

(00:00:51):
It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

Lenny (00:01:10):

Nir, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Nir Eyal (00:04:27):
Thanks so much, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:29):
I feel like we have a chance to record the most valuable hour in podcast history because it could give people more time to do the things they want to do. And this is based on a book that you wrote. It's called Indistractable, which is all about helping people become less distracted, become better at focus, and it might be the most essential skill in the workplace today. And so, what I'm hoping to do today in our chat is just basically give people as many tactical skills and pieces of advice and tools to become less distractable and to get better at focus. How does that sound?

Nir Eyal (00:04:59):
That sounds great. I love that you're setting the expectations high. I'll try and meet them.

Lenny (00:05:03):
Well now, we got to hit them. Okay, so here's the question. I'll just start really broad and let's just see where this goes. My question is just how does one become less distractable, slash how do I become less distractable?

Nir Eyal (00:05:15):
Okay, so there's a deeper motivation here. It's like, "I need help," which is great. That's my favorite thing to do, is to actually get concrete with people about what their specific challenges are. But let me back up here. So, this is what I spent five years writing a book about, because why did it take me five years to write a book? Because I was so distracted. So, I wrote this book for me more than anyone else. That's the only reason I write books. It's not because of what I know, but because of what I want to know. And I discovered that there were so many myths and tropes and just flat out harmful things that I was doing to hurt my own productivity. And when I really went down to first principles and looked at the research, I found that there were so many things that I was doing wrong.

(00:05:56):
But since I've changed my ways and adopted what the research literature says about distraction, it's improved my life in inconceivable ways. I'm in the best shape of my life at 45 years old. I have a better relationship with my family than ever. I'm more productive at work than ever before, not because I didn't know what to do. That's what I find is really emblematic of people today is not that we don't know what to do. It used to be maybe, okay, our grandparents, they didn't know what to do because the information was scarce. They had to go to the library and look things up. Well, today, with the internet, we all basically know what to do. And if you don't know what to do, Google it. You can find the answer out there. But we all basically know common-sense stuff like if you want to get in shape, you have to exercise and eat right, okay?

(00:06:38):
You don't need a diet book to tell you that. If you want to have better relationships with your family, you have to be fully present with people. If you want to do better at work, you have to do the hard work that other people don't want to do. We already know these things. What we don't know is how to get out of our own way, how to stop getting distracted. And so, that was certainly my problem. And so, what I wanted to do was really dive into the problem because the conventional solutions didn't work for me. When I have a problem in my life, I'll think about it, I'll write about it, I'll talk to friends, I'll talk to my wife about it. If I still can't figure it out, I'll read books about it. And what the conventional wisdom out there written by a lot of college professors that are all tenured is stop using technology, stop checking email, get off social media. It's melting your brain, but that's not very helpful, right?

(00:07:23):
Maybe if you have tenure, that's okay, but I can't stop using technology. My career will plummet. I have to use these tools. So, I wanted much more practical advice, and what I discovered was that the root cause of distraction is much more interesting and the solution is far more empowering than stop using technology, technology's evil, it's melting your brain. So, where do we begin? Maybe the best place to start is by first, before we dive into the tactics around how do we become indistractable, the first place to start is what is distraction? Understanding the term really, really matters. And the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand what distraction is not. What's the opposite of distraction? So, if you ask most people, what's the opposite of distraction?

(00:08:06):
They'll tell you focus, right? I don't want to be distracted, I want to be focused. That's not exactly right. Then in fact, the opposite of distraction is not focus. The opposite of distraction is traction. Becomes pretty easy when you look at both words, traction, distraction. They're opposites because both words come from the same Latin root, trahare, which means to pull, and they both end in the same six letters, A-C-T-I-O-N that spells action, reminding us that distraction is not something that happens to us. It is an action that we ourselves take. So, traction, by definition, is any action that pulls you towards what you say you were going to do, things you do with intent, things that move you closer to your values, and help you become the kind of person you want to become. Those are acts of traction. Now, the opposite of traction, distraction, is any action that pulls you away from what you plan to do, further away from your goals, further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.

(00:09:01):
And what separates traction from distraction is one word, and that one word is intent. I love this Dorothy Parker. She said, "The time you plan to waste is not wasted time." So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction. So, what I discovered, for me, was that I was getting tricked by distraction in that the most pernicious form of distraction I discovered was the kind I didn't even realize was distracting me.

(00:09:53):
So, let me know if this sounds familiar to you, Lenny. I would sit down at my desk. I would look at my to-do list. By the way, we can talk about why to-do lists are one of the worst things you can do for your personal productivity. We can get back to that later. But I would sit down at my desk and I'd say, "Okay, I've got that big important project. That's what I'm going to do this morning. I'm not going to get distracted, nothing's going to get in my way. Here I go, I'm going to get started, but first let me check some email."

Lenny (00:10:17):
Are you watching me because this happens to me every morning. You got to stop.

Nir Eyal (00:10:21):
This is totally autobiographical. This is what I used to do all the... "Oh, let me just scroll that Slack channel. What's everybody at the office doing? Oh, let me just catch up on industry news." That's important. That's part of my job. I'm being productive, right? And what I didn't realize is that distraction was tricking me into prioritizing the urgent and the easy stuff at the expense of the hard and important work I had to do to move my life and career forward. So, just because it's a work-related task, doesn't mean it's not a distraction. In fact, that's the worst kind of distraction. Far worse than playing Candy Crush or whatever because then you're putzing around, then at least it's obvious that you're distracted. But if you're just checking work email, you feel productive even though that's a distraction because it's not what you said you want to do with your time and attention. So now, we have this framework. We have traction, we have distraction.

(00:11:08):
Now, there's one more thing that's super important, then we'll have the entire picture so that we can stop thinking about the model and actually get to a brass tacks of what do we actually do. Now that we have traction distraction the other thing we have to consider are triggers. We have two kinds of triggers. We have external triggers. These are things in our outside environment, the usual suspects, the pings, the dings, the rings, all this stuff in our outside environment, which we tend to blame for distraction, but studies find, that's only 10% of the reason we get distracted, 10% of the time it's because of something outside of us. What's the other 90%? Turns out 90% of the time that we get distracted, it's not because of what's happening outside of us, but that most distraction begins from within boredom, loneliness, fatigue, uncertainty, anxiety. That is the cause of 90% of our distractions. So, whether it's too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much Facebook, you are always going to get distracted from one thing or another unless you understand the root cause of the problem.

(00:12:09):
So, step number one to becoming indistractable is to master those internal triggers or they will become your master. Now, we're working around those four points. Step number two, make time for traction. We can talk about that. Hack back the external triggers and step number four, prevent distraction with pacts. So, you asked a big question, I gave you a big answer. That's the overall framework. That's a strategy. Tactics are what you do. Strategy is why you do it. So, I wanted to explain the strategy before we got into the tactics.

Lenny (00:12:36):
Amazing. I love this word traction because it relates to kind of the other side of this podcast of growth, product market fit, building products people want, getting traction with users. So, I really like that there's this additional way of thinking about traction, which is basically not being distracted. Can you just repeat the four steps again for people to have this in mind?

Nir Eyal (00:12:55):
Step number one, master internal triggers. Step number two, make time for traction. So, this is where we're turning our values into time. We can talk about how to do that. Step number three is hack back the external triggers. This is where we get into the pings, dings, and rings, not just the obvious stuff like your phone, your computer. I take about a page and a half to talk about that. That's kind of kindergarten stuff. But what about all the non-obvious external triggers? What about stupid meetings that didn't need to be called? What about emails that didn't need to be sent and received? What about our kids? Our kids are wonderful. I know you're a new dad, they're fantastic to have kids, but they can also be a source of distraction. So, how do we deal with all those external triggers, and then finally prevent distraction with pacts and pacts are this firewall, this last resort against distraction that we can use to keep distraction at bay and it's really about these four steps in concert in this order that anyone can use to become indistractable.

Lenny (00:13:47):
Awesome. Does this spell something clever, by the way?

Nir Eyal (00:13:49):
No, I didn't have an acronym, but I do have a pretty picture.

Lenny (00:13:53):
Awesome. So, let's go through this and I'd love specifically example you shared, I think many people run into this. There's a hard thing I need to do and I'm just going to go check my email and Twitter instead. I feel like that's a very common distraction, and so sharing, getting into that at some point would be awesome, but otherwise let's get into these four steps.

Nir Eyal (00:14:09):
Yeah, well, we can absolutely do that. So, is that something you encounter? It sounds like a...

Lenny (00:14:13):
100%. Every time. I have my to-do list, work on next week's post, and then I'm like, "Oh, let me just go check Twitter or maybe tweet something and that'll be fun," and then totally check my email. "Oh, inbox zero. Let's get all the way to zero. Oh, that's cool. Okay, now the days are over."

Nir Eyal (00:14:28):
Exactly. And by the way, we are cut from the same cloth. This is exactly the pattern I used to get into and I knew I wasn't doing my best because I wasn't putting in the time to the things that were most important. I was doing just what was easy and what was urgent and that's not good enough. So, if we use this model, step number one is master the internal triggers. So, for you, Lenny, so when you say, "Okay, I know I've got to do this big important thing, but now I'm going to go check email," I would guess that there's some kind of underlying emotion that you're trying to escape. Let's put yourself in the shoes that you were in when you said, "I was going to do that big important thing, but now I'm going to check email instead." Do you remember the last time that happened, by the way?

Lenny (00:15:11):
Every morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:13):
Every morning. This morning?

Lenny (00:15:15):
Yeah, this morning.

Nir Eyal (00:15:16):
Okay, perfect. Do you recall what you were feeling right before you went to Twitter or checked email or did the thing that you didn't want to do as opposed to the thing you said you were going to do?

Lenny (00:15:27):
I don't know if this is an emotion or feeling, but there's just this, I need to get serious and start using my brain and there's going to be this deep work moment where I just get real deep and it takes a lot of effort to push me into that. Sometimes easier, sometimes harder. So, maybe it's avoiding this, "Oh, okay, I'm going to really have to think." It's like, I guess, it's the fear of the brain starting to really have to work.

Nir Eyal (00:15:51):
Yeah, that's hard work. So maybe, it's a bit of laziness. Maybe, it's a bit of momentum. There's this uncomfortable feeling of this cold start problem. "Oh, I don't really want to do it right now." So, this is incredibly important and I appreciate your candor here around what you feel because all of us experience it and we don't want to talk about it. We want to think that it's, "Oh, I'll just grayscale my phone," or, "I'll just turn off notifications and that's going to solve the problem," and it never does. And let me tell you, I tried all of it. I went to Alibaba and I bought myself one of these flip phones from China like we used to have in the 1990s with no apps, no internet connection, and then I got myself a word processor off of eBay, so that I could just sit down and write and do the important stuff.

(00:16:33):
And even when I stopped using all the technology, even when I got rid of all the apps, I would sit down on my desk and I'd say, "Oh, you know what? There's that book that I've been meaning what to do some research in," or, "Let me just clean off my desk real quick," or, "You know what? I should take out the trash." And I kept getting distracted because the problem is not our technology. The problem is our inability to deal with discomfort. So, what I have adopted for myself and what I'd advise anyone who finds themselves in this situation is to always identify what is that internal trigger, what is that itch that you are looking to escape when you get distracted, because that is the source of 90% of our distractions. It's not the pings, dings, and rings. It's the feelings. But to me, that's incredibly empowering because once you realize, "Wait a minute, it's just a feeling." It's all it is, it's just an emotion. Then you can have tools ready to go. You can have arrows in your quiver ready to take out as soon as you feel that discomfort.

(00:17:27):
So, let me give you one tool that I use every single day. Feel free to use it next time you feel this same problem. It's called the 10-minute rule, and this is just one of a dozen different techniques that you can use that I put in the book, but this is one that I use almost every single day. So, for me, I've been a professional writer now for over a decade, and writing is never easy. I hear people say like, "Oh, just form a writing habit." I think that's ridiculous. I don't know what they're talking about. A habit is defined as a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. I don't know how to write out of habit. Writing is always hard. Fricking work. I've written two bestsellers, thousands of articles and let me tell you, it's always difficult. It's hard, and all I want to do when I write is just Google this one thing or let me just check the news real quick or let me just do anything but the actual writing. So, here's what I do.

Lenny (00:18:15):
By the way, there's a great quote that I'll share real quick about this that I think I share often on this podcast that I think it's falsely attributed to Hemingway, but it's that, "Writing is easy. Just sit down at the keyboard and bleed."

Nir Eyal (00:18:27):
Oh my God, that's so true. It's so true, and I've not figured out how to make it suddenly easy. Every single word is hard to type out, but I got to do it right and I love doing it. I love having done it. In the process, it's very difficult. But after I make the discovery, after I create something that I think is useful, then it's a lot of fun. But doing the work is really difficult. So, here's what I do. Every time that I am tempted to go do something else, which is all the time, what I will do is I will take out a timer, I'll take out my phone and I'll say, "Set a timer for 10 minutes." I'll put the phone down and my job is for those 10 minutes, whenever I'm ready, get back to the task at hand or do what's called surf the urge.

(00:19:12):
Surfing the urge acknowledges that these emotions are like waves. They crest and then they subside. But that's not how we think about emotions. Most of us think about emotions as always being there. If I feel bored, I feel like I'm always going to be bored. If I'm frustrated, it feels like I'm always going to be frustrated, but that's never the case. Emotions are like waves. So, your job is to set that timer for 10 minutes and realize you can do just about anything for just 10 minutes. So, the idea is not to say don't do it. We know that this technique that a lot of people use of abstinence, telling yourself, "Don't do that, that's bad," actually can backfire. And we can talk about the psychology if that's interesting of why abstinence backfires. But a much healthier technique is not to tell yourself no. It's to tell yourself not yet.

(00:19:57):
You're not saying no, you're saying not yet. And so, you can do just about anything for 10 minutes. So, what I tell myself is, "Okay, I'm just going to wait 10 minutes before I check email, before I scroll social media, before I Google something that is just trying to procrastinate doing the work." I can do that. I'm a grown man. I can do whatever I want. I can do that in 10 minutes. And so, for those 10 minutes, all I have to do is either get back to the task at hand, get back to writing, or surf the urge, which is simply experiencing that sensation, acknowledging, "You know what? This is hard work. That's okay. That's why I'm feeling frustrated. That's why I'm feeling bored. That's why I'm feeling anxious. That's why I have this cold start around I don't really want to do this work because it's difficult."

(00:20:34):
So, what I do is I take a deep breath and I repeat a mantra that I made up for myself. You can make up your own mantra. My personal mantra whenever I feel this internal trigger is I remind myself this. I say, "This is what it feels like to get better. This is what it feels like to get better." And just saying that for as long as I need to until that emotion crests and subsides and then get back to work. What you'll find nine times out of 10 is that by the time those 10 minutes are up, you will have forgotten about that sensation. You'll be right back at the task at hand. And so, that's what's called the 10-minute rule. And of course what you're doing over time is that the 10-minute rule can become the 12-minute rule, can become the 20-minute rule, and most importantly, you are proving to yourself that you have agency that you said you were going to focus on a task and you did. That's the most important part.

(00:21:22):
The flip that we need to change in people's minds is this ridiculous belief that technology is hijacking our brains. There's nothing we can do about distraction that our focus is being stolen. It's not being stolen, we're giving it away. And so, what we need to do is to empower ourselves by showing ourselves in practice as well as in theory that we can postpone that distraction when we say we will.

Lenny (00:21:46):
What I like about this is one, it's kind of like the Pomodoro technique, but it's shorter. The 10 minutes I think is a really clever tweak versus 20 minutes, which a lot of people recommend. And then I guess a couple of follow-up questions. Do you do this one time in the morning and then not come back to it? Is this like a jump start for the day and then you start... If I start a thing like this, it won't be 10 minutes, it'll be like an hour because I'm like, "Okay, I did the hard thing, I'm into it. I'm just going to keep working." So, is this like a jump start for the morning or do you come back to this throughout the day?

Nir Eyal (00:22:13):
So, you can do it whenever you find yourself slipping off track. And so, the Pomodoro is a version of this. I don't think it's complete enough because Pomodoro just said, "Set the timer, do it." Okay, fine. And that's great if it works for you. By the way, anything I'm saying right now, if the thing is working for you, if your life is awesome and you're doing what you said you're going to do, maybe this isn't the podcast. Maybe my book isn't the book for you, right? I'm talking to the people who, for whatever reason, you know you're capable of more, you know you're drifting off track. Maybe if like me, you said you were going to exercise but you didn't or you said you're going to eat right, but you don't. You said you were going to work on that big task, but you procrastinate. That's really who I was and that's who I wrote this book for.

(00:22:49):
And so, you can use that technique whenever you get distracted. It's not the whole picture. So, it's super important. Remember we talked about those four steps. This is just step number one. There's about a dozen different things you can do. Maybe this particular 10-minute rule doesn't work for you, doesn't work for everyone. There might be other techniques you use. So, there's dozens of different techniques just about this step around mastering internal triggers. But the next step to answer your question of well, how long do I go for? Do I do it for an hour? If now, I'm in the zone? And my answer is emphatically no. You don't go as long as you think you can. What you want to do, and this is step number two, is you're making time for traction by turning your values into time, which means you are going to make a time box schedule because you cannot call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from.

(00:23:39):
I'll say that again. You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from. So, for me, at least, when I would succumb to, "Oh, let me just check email for a quick minute, let me just see what's happening on Twitter for a quick minute," part of that was because I would justify to myself, "Well, this is a work-related task. I got to do it sometime," and there wasn't a specific time to do it on my calendar, so I would keep thinking, "Well, I got to do it sometime. Might as well just do it now." And that's a huge mistake because if you can't look at your calendar and say, "Oh, that's traction." Okay, check email, write the blog post, post the podcast, go on social media. If that's not what's written in your calendar, if it's not there, it's a distraction. And so, it's not just work-related stuff. I literally have time in my calendar, spend time with my daughter, go on social media, watch Netflix. It's in my calendar. So now, I took what was previously distraction and I turned it into traction by putting it on my schedule.

Lenny (00:24:37):
So, you actually do this through the day you have, "I'm going to check Twitter during this time of the day, I'm going to hang out with my daughter during this time of the day."

Nir Eyal (00:24:44):
Exactly. And you're adjusting it never in the day. So, you never want to do that. You always want to make sure you're doing it the day before. And so, what I do once a week, Sunday evenings, it takes me maybe 10 minutes a week. 8:00 P.M., I sit down, I look at my schedule for the week ahead and I ask myself, "Does this schedule reflect my values?" What are values? Values are attributes of the person you want to become. I'll say it again. Values are attributes of the person you want to become. So, there's three life domains, you, your relationships, and finally your work. So, what you got to do is you look at your calendar for the week ahead and you ask yourself, "How would the person I want to become spend time taking care of themselves?" That's the you domain. If you can't take care of yourself, you can't take care of others, you can't make the world a better place.

(00:25:26):
So then, you put in your calendar how you want to take care of yourself. What might that include? Well, time for rest. We all know how important sleep is, but I used to yell at my daughter and say, "Oh, it's your bedtime. You got to get to bed." And then one day she said to me, "Daddy, do you have a bedtime?" She was absolutely right. I was a hypocrite because I know how important sleep is and I didn't have a bedtime. Now, I have a bedtime. It's in my schedule. Then put in time for whatever else is important to you. Is reading important to you? Is prayer important to you? Is meditation, is exercise, is video games, is that important to you? Great. Whatever's important to you according to your values, put it in your schedule. Then you're going to put your relationships in. So, don't let the relationships in your life get whatever scraps of time are left over.

(00:26:08):
Put time in your schedule for your significant other, for your kids, for your buddies. How many of us are trapped in this loneliness epidemic because we don't make time for our closest relationships, including adult friendships? Don't let those wither away. Put time in your schedule for those, as well. We know that most friendships, they don't die in some big blowout. Relationships starve to death because we don't invest in them. Put time in your schedule for those relationships. We can talk about how to do that, as well. Then finally, the work domain involves two kinds of work. We have what's called reactive work and reflective work. Reactive work, reacting to notifications, reacting to emails, reacting to taps on the shoulder from your colleagues. That's going to be part of everybody's day. I get that, but don't let that be your entire day because what most people do, they habituate into not wanting to think.

(00:26:56):
They don't want to think what's important. "So, just let me look at my email inbox. My email inbox will tell me what to do. What's really important for my business? That's really hard. I don't really want to think about that. I'll look at my to-do list and I'll start ticking off easy tasks to do that make me feel productive." That's terrible. What you want to do instead is to book time in your schedule for this reflective work time, which is where you do the kind of work that requires you to work without distraction. Planning, strategizing, thinking, for god's sakes, can only be done without distraction. So, that fills up your calendar, as well. And what you're going to find, that there's never enough time for everything, which is good because what this forces you to do, and this is one of the main reasons why to-do lists suck, is because to-do lists have no constraints.

(00:27:38):
You can always add more to a to-do list. You can always add more, but here's what happens. This is what happened to me. I would get home from work. I have a very busy day and I'd look at my to-do list and it's a hundred items long and I think, "Wow, I've been working real hard all day and look at all this stuff I still didn't do. Loser." And so, day after day, week after week, month after month, I was reinforcing this self-image as someone who doesn't know how to manage their time. And then I started saying stupid stuff like, "Oh, maybe I'm no good at time management. Maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD. Maybe there's something wrong with me." There's nothing wrong with me. There's something wrong with this very stupid to-do list method, which doesn't force you to understand that there are trade-offs that you have to prioritize properly and that can only be done with constraints and that constraints come from your calendar.

(00:28:23):
So, you're turning your values into time by making time for traction and having this calendar and then, only then you can look at your calendar and say, "Ah, whatever it is I plan to do, that's traction. Everything else is distraction."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I want to share a couple things that worked for me that are very much along these lines. One is booking. I call it deep work time within the day. This was the only thing I had in the calendar, so I didn't do the other things, which I think would've been really helpful, but I had a, I called it deep work time. I will slap you if you book anything over this meeting.

Nir Eyal (00:28:36):
I love it.

Lenny (00:28:55):
And I did that every Monday morning, Wednesday morning, and Friday sometime, and on that...

Nir Eyal (00:28:59):
Who was slapping you?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I would be slapping the person that booked time over that slot and nobody can...

Nir Eyal (00:29:05):
Okay, got it.

Lenny (00:29:06):
And I don't know if that's allowed these days. I don't know how this...

Nir Eyal (00:29:10):
Depends who you're booking with, I guess.

Lenny (00:29:11):
Yeah, make it a little less aggressive maybe. But that worked a ton. It was like a two- or three-hour block of deep work time and that made a big dent in my ability to have time to focus because people weren't booking me as a PM.

Nir Eyal (00:29:23):
Yeah, I love it. And by the way, I want to hear more of these, but that illustrates a really good point that when the stakes are high enough, I hear people a lot of times saying, "I just can't find the time to focus and I can't get this done and it's impossible these days." And then I say, "Well, let's make a little wager here." Let's say, I get this around physical fitness a lot or somebody says, "Oh, I want to be an author. How do I do that? How do I write the book? I can't seem to find the time." And they constantly say why They can't, they can't, they can't. "There's this constraint. My boss wants this. My kids want that." They have every kind of excuse. And then I say, "Okay, let's say that if you don't work out, 8:00 A.M. Monday morning, if you don't work out, you're going to have to pay me $10,000. Are you going to do it? Are you going to work out?"

(00:30:03):
"Well, of course, I'm going to work out. Easily. Yes, of course." Okay, so we've established you can. Now, we're just negotiating the price. So, this has to do with step four around making pacts, making what's called a pre-commitment, and one of them is a price pact. This is how I got in shape. I used to be clinically obese. Today, I'm in the best shape of my life, partially because I use these pacts. Now, the important thing is you have to do this last. If you don't figure out the internal triggers, most importantly, if you don't make time for traction in your schedule, if you don't hack back the external triggers, this fourth step won't work. But as the last line of defense, it's incredibly impactful and we can talk about how to do that, as well.

Lenny (00:30:39):
I heard the all-in guys did this to lose weight. I think Sax and Jason did a pact, too. I think it was a lot of money, a hundred thousand dollars or something wild for...

Nir Eyal (00:30:49):
Oh, that's awesome. Actually, that's what I used to finish this book, as well. Maybe they read my book, I wonder, because I talked about this exact situation.

Lenny (00:30:55):
You hit it. It sounds like. You made it.

Nir Eyal (00:30:57):
I did? Yeah.

Lenny (00:31:00):
Another trick I'll share that I found useful around the to-do list. So, I used to-do lists, but I've learned that I can't just let them grow is when I had a regular job. I wrote it down in a notebook and every morning, I rewrote the to-do list so that it reminded me like, "Okay, I've copied this thing 10 times now. I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to push it out." So, that act of just rethinking about it every day was really impactful. But that works for people that are okay with an analog to-do list. If it's digital, that doesn't go away.

Nir Eyal (00:31:29):
So, I just want to clarify, there's nothing wrong with taking things out of your brain and putting them on a piece of paper. That's wonderful, but that's step one. And so, the big mistake that people make is they put stuff on their to-do list and then they wake up in the morning and what are they supposed to do? "Well, I'll do whatever's on my to-do list." And so, what they tend to do is the easy stuff. I've known people, I hate to tell you, I used to do this myself, too. I would do a task and then forget to put it on my to-do list. So, I would go back in and write it on my to-do list just so I could check off the box. How messed up is that? It's ridiculous. And I think this is something that I think really does need to change is that we have this culture where checking stuff off your list is our little emotional reward, right?

(00:32:12):
But that's ridiculous. We need to stop measuring ourselves by how many cute little boxes we check off. And rather, a much more important metric is not, "Did I finish the task?" I don't want you to track, "Did I finish?" That's not the important part, but people are probably scratching their heads. What do you mean? Isn't it all about finishing what I have to do? No, the important part is figuring out your productivity. It's figuring out how efficient you are at using your time. So, a much more beneficial metric to track is not, "Did I check off the box? Did I finish?" Rather, it's, "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?" I'll say it again. "Did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction?"

(00:32:53):
Because that is the only way to understand how long things take you. The problem with to-do lists is that there is no feedback loop, there's no feedback mechanism. How long do things take you? So, this is why you have what's called the planning fallacy with people who use to-do lists, which says that on average, studies have found that tasks take people three times longer to finish than they estimate. Why does that happen? Because when you say, "Okay, here's that thing on the to-do list. I'm going to work on that and see how long it takes me to get it done." So, you work on it for five minutes and then you get an email and then you get a notification and then you start talking to one of your colleagues and you never actually track how long that thing took you to finish, as opposed to when you say, "Look, I'm going to work on that task for as long as I said I would, but without distraction. That's it. That's all I'm going to do."

(00:33:39):
What you now have is a metric of how far you got. So, I worked on that presentation, it needs to be 30 slides long, and I worked on it for 30 minutes and I finished two slides. Okay, great. Well now, I know that I need 10 more of those time boxes to finish the entire task. And this is why it turns out that people who measure themselves the way I espouse of people who say, "I'm just going to measure myself based on, did I do what I said I was going to do for as long as I said I would without distraction regardless of whether I finished," the kicker here is they actually finish more. They get more done than the to-do list people because now, they understand how long things take them to finish and they can appropriately time that as opposed to what most of us did.

(00:34:20):
What I used to do before I wrote Indistractable was procrastinate, procrastinate, procrastinate. "Oh crap, I got to get this done. The deadline's here, so I'm going to work all night to finish it," and of course, that's not when you do your best work and it's very stressful.

Lenny (00:34:31):
Since you mentioned deadlines, do you have any advice lessons on that as a tool to get things done?

Nir Eyal (00:34:36):
What we find is that people who are very deadline motivated, they do finish what they say they're going to do, but of course, the quality is crap. They're typically getting by by the skin of their teeth, and I did this all the time. This is my entire college career and my MBA at Stanford career was waiting, waiting, waiting, and then finishing at the last moment. And I could do well enough, but of course, I could do so much better if I worked without distraction. And so, it wasn't until, and we all know this basically, right? We know that putting in a little bit of diligent effort, a little bit at a time with plenty of lead time is going to give us a much better result than cramming at the last minute. But the reason people don't do this is because they don't understand how important it is, one, to manage those internal triggers.

(00:35:22):
If you're constantly thinking, "Ugh, that project is going to suck. I don't really want to work on it. I don't want to make those sales calls. I don't want to make that presentation. I don't want to do that thing that feels uncomfortable," and you don't have the tools to deal with that discomfort, you're always going to procrastinate because fundamentally, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem. It's not a character flaw. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not broken. It's just that you don't have the tools to deal with emotional discomfort and that's the part that everybody skips over. So, we don't want to talk about these uncomfortable feelings, but that's where it has to start. And then, the part that people don't do is actually planning out not the task itself, but the time to work on the task without distraction. That's the part that if you can implement that step two that I talked about of making time for traction, that becomes a game changer.

Lenny (00:36:08):
So, I've tried things like this where it's here throughout the day, I'm going to try this, I'm going to do this and this, and I just don't end up doing it. Things come up or I just get distracted. I'm like, whatever. I guess one question is how often do you find yourself doing the things you set out in your calendar? And then two, any other advice for actually staying on track and doing things you set out to?

Nir Eyal (00:36:28):
Okay, so number one, did you have tools in place to deal with the discomfort? What did you do when you didn't feel it?

Lenny (00:36:32):
I did not. I did not have that surfing the wave and the ten-minute trick, and I'm curious if there's other tricks in that bucket actually, but no, I did not.

Nir Eyal (00:36:39):
Absolutely. Yeah. So, that's the most important thing and that is the most important section. That's why I put it at the front of the book because again, procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, and I think this is fascinating. Personally, I really wanted to dive deep and not only understand why do we not do what we say we're going to do, but why do we do anything and everything? What is the seat of human motivation? And I think I didn't understand it properly. I think most people don't understand motivation properly. Doesn't that blow your mind? If you think about it, "I know what to do. I agree, this is what needs to get done. I just don't do it." Isn't that ridiculous? And by the way, this is not a new problem. Plato, 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher talked about this very same problem. 2500 years before the internet, before social media, before all these things that we think are so distracting online, the Greek philosopher has had the same exact problem.

(00:37:27):
This is part of the human condition. It is part of our DNA that we constantly get distracted. But to me, that's a fascinating mystery. Why is that? Well, if you look at the deeper question of why do we do anything and everything, the seat of human motivation most people think is about carrots and sticks. If you ask people, why do we do what we do? It's about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Jeremy Bentham said something similar to this. Sigmund Freud called it the pleasure principle. Neurologically speaking, it's not true. It's not true. It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It's not about carrots and sticks, but in fact, the carrot is the stick, okay? This is where I want to give you that matrix-like... Remember that scene, the Matrix, where there's that kid with a spoon and the spoon starts bending and the kid says, "Imagine there is no spoon," right?

Lenny (00:38:14):
Absolutely.

Nir Eyal (00:38:14):
Well, the carrot is the stick. What do I mean by that? We know that the only reason we do everything in anything from a neurological perspective is not about the pursuit of pleasure. It is all about the desire to escape discomfort. Everything you do, even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the carrot is the stick, because even wanting to feel good, craving, lusting, desire, hunger, that desire for something that feels good is itself psychologically destabilizing. The carrot is the stick. So, what that means, I think that's incredibly empowering because what that means is that whenever we don't do something, whenever we procrastinate, it's just a feeling. It's all it is. It's just a feeling. And so, when we learn those tools, it doesn't mean where I think people start intellectualizing it and thinking, "There must be something broken with me. Maybe you need a pill, maybe you need a treatment."

(00:39:07):
Chances are there's a ninety-nine percent chance, there's nothing wrong with you. It's simply that you don't have these tools. So, that's where we have to start, is absolutely understanding and applying these techniques so that when you feel that discomfort, you use that discomfort. What I found in my research writing this book is that high performers in every industry, business, the arts, sports, high performers, they feel the same internal triggers. They also feel lonely. They also feel bored. They also feel stressed. They also feel anxious, but they use that discomfort like a rocket fuel to propel them towards traction. Whereas what distractable people do, as soon as they feel uncomfortable, as soon as they feel bored, as soon as they feel lonesome, as soon as soon as they feel indecisive or stressed, boom, they're escaping it with a drink, with a click, with something to take their mind off of that discomfort. So, that has to be step number one.

Lenny (00:39:55):
That is fascinating. Basically, distraction is an emotional regulation problem. It's the way you put it. What else works in helping you manage that discomfort? We've talked about this ten-minute trick, the timer, the surfing of the urge. What else is in that bucket of things I could try when I'm just like, "Nah, I'm just going to go check Twitter. I need to work on this thing, right now."

Nir Eyal (00:40:13):
Yeah, so there's a bunch of different techniques you can use there in terms of the internal triggers. We can get into some of the more nitty-gritty techniques. There's lots and lots of them. The most important thing here though is that once you have some in your toolkit that you want to try, let's say it's a ten-minute rule, it's surfing the urge, there's re-imagining the task, the temperament, all kinds of things that you can do. The next thing is to put it on your calendar, which we talked about briefly. So, let's say you say, "Okay, I've got that time when I..." What did you say that you want to do, that you check email instead?

Lenny (00:40:40):
Start on my newsletter post for the next week, or just continue.

Nir Eyal (00:40:43):
To write it?

Lenny (00:40:44):
Yeah, write it.

Nir Eyal (00:40:46):
Okay. And did you have that in your calendar? That was part of the time punch-me-in-the-face-if-I-don't-do-it kind of thing?

Lenny (00:40:50):
That was back when I had a regular job. These days, it's just, what I used to do is my first half of the day until 3:00 is just deep work time. I called it it's-time-to-build time, and then 3:00 beyond is meetings. So, it was actually a huge block of time of focus time, but it was not subdivided by the things I wanted to do throughout the day.

Nir Eyal (00:41:10):
I see. Okay. So, step two would be putting on your calendar, "I'm going to work on writing this newsletter for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, whatever amount of time." Make it whatever is reasonable for you based on how long you think you can do it. Put that on your schedule. Okay? Step number three is hack back the external triggers. So, did you find that when you said I was going to work on writing this newsletter, was there anything in your external environment that was pinging, dinging, kids, pets, spouse, anything like that?

Lenny (00:41:38):
It's interesting that now that you say that, just that fact that only 10% of distractions are from that. So, it makes me, on the one hand, I recognize that most of the time, there's not a thing pulling me to Twitter, LinkedIn, or whatever. Most of the time, it's just like, that's probably something interesting going on. But there's definitely times when I see a little badge or my little phone gets a little push or yeah, my wife's with a kid in the distance. I'm like, "Oh, let's go check out what's happening there."

Nir Eyal (00:42:02):
Yeah. So, that's where we want to hack back. So, the reason I use the term hack. To hack something is to gain unauthorized access. Someone hacks into your bank account or hacks into your database. We know that these technologies are gaining unauthorized access to our attention span when they're constantly pinging and dinging us. So, there's some very simple things you can do. Setting a schedule in advance so that your device turns off as it goes to do-not-disturb during certain times of the day or before you begin this task, before you start writing, you make sure to turn on do-not-disturb, so that there's nothing in your way. On my desktop, I have a do-not-disturb set from midnight to 11:59 all the time. It's constantly on do-not-disturb because I don't want these constant notifications disturbing me when I'm doing focus work.

(00:42:52):
So, making sure that that's on. When it comes to, many of us work from home today, so making sure that your family knows when the time is that you are indistractable. And I'll give you one tip. I know you have a baby at home, but soon, that baby is going to be a toddler. And so, one thing that we did in my household is that my wife went to Amazon and she got what we call the concentration crown. And the concentration crown is just this little wreath thing that she wears. It looks like a little princess thing. It has little LED lights. It lights up. There's a picture of it in the book. And when my daughter was only six years old, we told her, "Look, whenever mommy is wearing the concentration crown, that means that she can't be interrupted and she will be with you within 30 minutes."

(00:43:37):
So, her time block was always no more than 30 minutes. So, we said, "We will be with you within 30 minutes. Please don't interrupt unless you're bleeding. Okay? If you're bleeding, you can interrupt us, but unless you're bleeding," this is when my daughter was only six years old. She could find something to do. It's okay for kids to be bored time to time, but as long as mommy was wearing the concentration crown that told her, and by the way, me, as her significant other, as her husband, worked really, really well because I would always interrupt her and say, "Hey Julie, can I ask you this one thing?" And she was working on her computer, but I didn't know whether she was listening to a podcast or a video or doing work that needed concentration. So, hacking back those external triggers, making sure that they don't gain unauthorized access by interrupting the interruption, whether it's with your kids, your colleagues.

(00:44:24):
So, every copy of indistractable has this little pull-out piece of paper, this piece of card stock that you fold into thirds and you put on your computer monitor. Okay, it's this big red sign on your computer monitor that says, "I'm indistractable at the moment. Please come back later." Now you can say, "Well, why don't I just put on headphones and my colleagues will know I'm not to be interrupted?" Yeah, but then they think you're putzing around, playing video games or something on your machine, as opposed to if you say, "No, I'm doing focused work right now, please come back later," you're making it acceptable to not constantly be interrupted. You're making it okay culturally appropriate to work without distractions. So, those are just some ways that you can hack back those external triggers.

Lenny (00:45:03):
I love that crown idea. I think a lot of people are going to use that. This time of year is prime for career reflection and setting goals for professional growth. I always like to spend this time reflecting on what I accomplished the previous year, what I hope to accomplish the next year, and whether this is the year, I look for a new opportunity.

(00:45:58):
For avoiding distractions, triggers, pushes, all that stuff, is there any tools you recommend? I imagine, this is a lot of people are thinking. Is there like a way to block Twitter?

Nir Eyal (00:46:07):
Yeah, absolutely. So, that's a perfect lead-in to step number four. So, we talked about step one, master internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers. We just talked about step number three. Step number four is preventing distraction with pacts. So with pacts, there's three kinds of pacts. We have a price pact, where there's some kind of financial disincentive to go off track. So, this is where we talked about earlier. You're making some kind of bet. We could talk about how I got into shape for the first time in my life using something like this. How I finished the book using something like this. That's a price pact. There's an identity pact, which is very, very impactful, which is what you're doing is you're forming a personal identity. So, this comes out of the psychology of religion where we know that people who call themselves a certain moniker. For example, if you say you're a devout Muslim, you're not debating whether you should have a gin and tonic because devout Muslims don't drink.

(00:46:58):
If you say I'm a vegan or vegetarian, a vegetarian doesn't wake up in the morning and say, "Hmm, I wonder if I should have a bacon sandwich for breakfast." No, they are vegetarian. That is who they are. So, that's why the book is called Indistractable. Indistractable Is meant to sound like indestructible. It is your identity, it is who you are. And so, is it any different for someone to say, "You know what? I'm sorry I don't check every ping and ding every 30 seconds. I'm Indistractable. Or, "You know what? If we're going to have a meal together, if we're going to sit down and have lunch together, I want to have that lunch free of distractions. So, can we put away our phones?" Is that any different from someone who says, "I have particular dietary preferences," or, "I have a particular religious garb?"

(00:47:35):
No, maybe it's not the norm. Maybe it's a minority of people who do that. But that's what I think it's going to take for the world to become indistractable, is that more of us show how great of a life we can have when we have some of these principles and make it part of our identity. And then the third pact is what's called an effort pact. And this gets into your question around what kind of tools we can use. An effort pact is where there's some kind of friction, some kind of effort that you need to take in order to get distracted. So, as the last line of defense, that's why this is the fourth step, the last line of defense, the firewall against distraction is making sure that you keep yourself in just as much as we keep distractions out. So, I'll give you a personal story here. I don't don't know if this is a family show. Is it okay if I talk about my sex life a little bit?

Lenny (00:48:22):
Absolutely. Let's talk and get into it.

Nir Eyal (00:48:25):
It's not as exciting as it might sound. I've been married for twenty-two years now. My wife and I found that we weren't being as intimate as we used to be. And this was when I first started writing the book. And part of the problem was that every night, we would go to bed and she would be fondling her iPhone and I would be caressing my iPad. And we weren't being intimate because we were busy playing with our devices as opposed to each other. And so, I started doing this research around Indistractable and I learned about this technique around making an effort pact. And so, what we did, I went to the hardware store and I bought us this $10 outlet timer and this outlet timer, anything you plug into it will turn on or off at a particular time of day or night, whatever you set.

(00:49:15):
And so, in my household, until this very day, every night at 10:00 P.M., my internet router shuts off. So, what does that do? We know that every night, 10:00 P.M., the internet router's going to shut off. So, my daughter knows, my wife knows, I know. I got to get everything done that I need to do online because the internet's going to shut off. Now, could I turn the internet back on? Of course, I could. I could tether, I could go pull out the router and replug it in, but that takes effort. And so, what I've done is if all else fails, if the internal triggers, making time for traction, hacking back, if all else fails, I've inserted a bit of mindfulness in something that I used to be mindless about. Now, I have to ask myself, "Wait a minute. Do I really need to go all that trouble of replugging and unplugging my router or should I do what I said I was going to do, which is get to bed on time and maybe be intimate with my wife?"

(00:50:05):
It's made a world of difference and I'll tell you honestly, Lenny. Now after a few years of doing this, it's become part of our routine. We all know bedtime's at 10:00 P.M. That's when we need to start getting ready for bed. The internet router's going to shut off. We actually don't even need this anymore because it's become part of our routine. So, that's one very cheap tool anyone can use as part of this effort pact. Another thing that I use almost every day, my daughter uses it as well, is this wonderful app called Forest. Do you know Forest?

Lenny (00:50:32):
No.

Nir Eyal (00:50:33):
It's awesome. So, here's the way Forest works. So, it's this cute little app here. I can show it to you. I'll pull it up. And the way Forest works is when you say you're going to do focused work time, you plug in how much work time you want. So, let's say I'm going to do 40 minutes of focused work time. There's that cute little virtual tree that's planted on my screen as soon as I hit go and if I pick up my phone and I do anything with it, that cute little virtual tree gets cut down. It's just a small reminder to say, "Yep, that's not what you said you were going to do right now. You said you were going to work with that distraction. Here, you are picking up your phone." It reminds you, this is not what you said you were going to do. So, it inserts that bit of friction, that bit of effort. Another, you asked for more tools. Another product I love is called Focusmate. Have you tried Focusmate?

Lenny (00:51:22):
Is that the one where they match you with somebody and you're kind of working, watching each other work?

Nir Eyal (00:51:25):
Yes, exactly. It's like a chat roulette without the dirty bits. So, I love this company so much, I actually invested in it. So basically, what you do is you go online, you look at this calendar and you pick a time when you want to do focused work. So, one of my issues used to be getting started. Once I got started, I was good, but getting started 8:00 A.M., I kind of like what you were saying with this cold start problem. So, what it does is it gives you this pact, again, this pre-commitment you're making with another person, "Okay, 8:00 A.M., I'm going to be there. And if you don't show up, you're going to get a bad review." So, it binds you to another person to build this effort pact to say, "I will be here at that time." You say, "Okay, what are you working on? What am I working on? All right, go." And for that entire time box, you work without distraction. And just seeing that other person who's also working without distraction is a wonderful way to bind you into what you said you were going to do.

(00:52:17):
So, those are just a few tools. There's many, many others.

Lenny (00:52:20):
Amazing. Okay, so let me actually try to just list out all the things you've shared so far and it's going to be across all the four steps and then I'm going to follow up on a couple things here. So, here's my notes. One is this idea of just set a ten-minute timer and just tell yourself, "I am going to work on something that I really want to work on right now for 10 minutes and that's all I'm going to do." And while you're doing that, surf the urge, you're going to feel like you don't, but just surf it and feel it and be aware that this is difficult. The calendaring of your day, that feels like a fundamental part of your approach is just figure out what you want to do during the day. Ahead of time, put it on the calendar. So, your to-do list is your calendar, essentially.

(00:53:02):
There's this whole idea of pacts. You shared a bunch of different pact ideas, there's like I'll pay you a lot of money if I don't do this. There's this Wi-Fi. Okay. And then I guess that translates into some of these other things. The Wi-Fi killer device, the Forest app, the Focusmate app and product. And then there's a few other things you shared. Just do not disturb, like set a timer so that during the day, you have do-not-disturb on during set times. For you, it's all the time, which I try to do, too. And then obviously, let your wife through important contacts and then make your family aware of when you're going to be working so that they know not to bother you. Maybe this concentration crown.

Nir Eyal (00:53:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:42):
Okay. Before we move on to a different topic, I'd love to spend a little more time in that first bucket because it feels like your point is so important that most of our distraction is this emotional regulation and we just don't like discomfort. And so, I'm curious what else you could teach me and teach people about getting better at managing that emotion. Are there any other tactics in that bucket that might be useful?

Nir Eyal (00:54:02):
Absolutely. So, there's three big buckets in terms of mastering these internal triggers. We can reimagine the task, reimagine the trigger, and reimagine our temperament. And so, maybe I can give you one big tip I think that I discovered when it came to reimagining our temperament. If we think about our temperament as these immutable qualities, as the attributes of our personality, we have to be very careful about what kind of identity and what kind of limitations we let in to our psyche. And I'll give you a good example of this. So, a few years ago, there was this line of research around what's called ego depletion. Ego depletion is this idea that willpower is a depletable resource. And you saw some researchers doing studies that seem to suggest that willpower was something that you run out of, that for me, I would come home after a long day of work and I'd say, "Oh, I'm out of willpower. I'm 'spent', there's nothing else I can do. Give me that pint of Ben and Jerry's. I'm going to sit in front of the TV because I'm spent. There's no more willpower left."

(00:55:03):
And some of these studies seem to suggest there was this phenomenon except the problem became that in the social sciences when something sounds a little fishy, when it sounds too good to be true, the scientific process dictates that we should rerun those studies. And it turns out that these studies around ego depletion could not replicate. We couldn't find the effect. And so, there was one exception to this and that exception was in a study done by Carol Dweck, she's one of my research heroes. She wrote the book Mindset, you're probably familiar with, and she did a fascinating study where she found that ego depletion does actually exist, but only for one group of people.

(00:55:42):
Who was that group of people? It turns out that the only people who really did run out of willpower the way you would run out of charge in a battery were people who believed that willpower was a limited resource. And so, this is super, super important to not let ourselves be influenced by these ridiculous notions, these beliefs that somehow we are impaired, that we are limited, that we're addicted. That's a really popular one, that we're all addicted, we're all unable to control these behaviors. That is not true. And in fact, it's only true if you believe it is true. So, it should be part of our practice to tell ourselves we are indistractable. Indistractable is meant to sound like indestructible. It's meant to sound like a superpower. So, repeating to yourself that you're not limited, it's just about your actions. It's not a moral failing. It's not something wrong with you. It's not that technologies are doing it to you. It's simply a series of behaviors that we have to practice.

Lenny (00:56:37):
I really like that. That's a theme that comes up a lot on this podcast is people that feel like they're responsible for their situation, they didn't cause it, but they're still responsible. It is their responsibility to deal with it, end up being more successful. And there's this idea of just being high agency.

Nir Eyal (00:56:52):
So, one of the things that I think is important to remember here is that there's a lot of things that the individual can do. I think there's a lot of things that we can do within a company or an organization, as well, that we can make our workplace indestructible. But then I think there's some things that we can do on a societal level, and these are called social antibodies. That social antibodies are when society spreads norms or manners that help us overcome otherwise antisocial or destructive behaviors. And so, the good news is that we have been here before with something far more harmful and far more addictive than social media or technology distractions. If you think back to the 1980s, I was a child of the '80s. I remember the '80s very well, and I remember when I was growing up, we had ashtrays in our living room.

(00:57:41):
In fact, everyone I knew had ashtrays in their living room. And today, that sounds crazy. You couldn't imagine walking into someone's home and lighting up a cigarette. If someone did that to you, that would be crazy. No one would do that today. Well, why? Why did that happen? Why would it be so incredibly rude to just walk into someone's home and light up a cigarette? Well, because there wasn't a law that said that that was illegal, someone's private residence. What changed was that we have new norms, new manners around how to behave when it comes to these destructive behaviors. So, I remember when my mom took away those ashtrays in our living room and she threw them away, and one day, one of her friends came over and took out a pact of cigarettes and was about to light a cigarette. My mom said, "No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. We are nonsmokers."

(00:58:26):
You see, she had this now and that she used to describe herself. She described herself as a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, if you'd kindly go outside. And of course, that's the norm today. But it took great people like my mom to go against the trend for these antisocial behaviors. So, I think the same thing is going to happen when it comes to becoming indistractable. Frankly, with or without my book, my book was intended to accelerate this process, but we're going to do this naturally because what humans do throughout history when it comes to figuring out how to use a technology well is that we adapt and we adopt. We adapt to the technology by forming new behaviors, new norms. So, just like my mom said, "Hey, we are nonsmokers. That's my identity. I'm a nonsmoker. If you'd like to smoke, you're going to have to go outside."

(00:59:09):
We need to be comfortable with saying, "Hey, we are indistractable." If someone sits down with you across the table and you're having a nice conversation, they take out their funny, say, "Hey, hey, if we're going to have a conversation, let's be here both in body and mind." That means putting these devices outside of meetings. If we're going to have a business meeting or a personal meeting, we're going to declare these no-phone zones because that's who we are. We want to be indistractable. So, we adopt these new behaviors and we see that happening already. And then we adapt to these behaviors, I should say, with these new norms. And then we adopt new technologies that help us fight the bad aspects of the last generation of technology, and that's what we have always done.

(00:59:48):
In fact, right now, there's an explosion of tech companies that are making a lot of money. A lot of these apps and startups are making money with tools to help fix the last generation of technology. And so, there's all kinds of tools listed in my book from Forest and Focusmate, all kinds of tools that can help us put technology in its place, ironically enough, with new and better technology.

Lenny (01:00:09):
You've touched on this point that I want to come back to around how you're not as confident that we're as addicted to technology and apps as we think, and I think that's really important. I'm excited to chat about it. Before we get there, I wanted to chat and follow this thread essentially of becoming Indistractable at work and building a company essentially that helps your teammates become less distractable. What advice would you give to leaders at companies to help employees at the company have better focus, essentially?

Nir Eyal (01:00:37):
A lot of folks that I've worked with in the past have said, "Look, I can become indistractable. I follow these four steps, fantastic. I'm indistractable. But what if my company's not indistractable? How do I help other people become indistractable? Or what if my boss is not indistractable and they're constantly asking me and pinging and dinging me for stuff and I'm not able to do my best work? So, what do I do about that?" So, there's a whole section in the book on how to build an indistractable workplace. And what I discovered was in the research in writing this book is that indistractable companies have three traits. And so, the first trait is that Indistractable companies provide employees with what's called psychological safety. This comes out of the research from Amy Edmondson at the Harvard Business School. And what she discovered was truly that companies have to provide employees with psychological safety.

(01:01:23):
Meaning, if you can't talk about a problem, if you can't raise your hand and say, "Hey, you know what? I'm just not able to do my best work when I'm constantly expected to reply to every email, to every notification, every 30 seconds. I can't do my best work." If you can't talk about this problem, that is the problem. As I like to say, distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. Distraction is a symptom of dysfunction. And when it comes to the workplace, if you don't give employees that psychological safety to say, "Hey, how do we deal with this problem just like any other problem?" That in fact is a problem. It's not the technology, it's the fact that you can't get together and talk about this problem without fear of somebody thinking, "Oh, you're lazy," or, "You don't want to be on call," or, "You're expecting other people to work for you."

(01:02:04):
No, that's not the issue at all. It's simply that we need to formulate how to fix this problem just like any other business challenge. The second trait is employees need a forum to talk about this problem. So, in researching this book, I ask people, what's the most distracting technology? What technology in the workplace do you find to be most distracting? The number two was some kind of group messaging service, and Slack was mentioned the most number of times. By the way, number one was email. Number two was some kind of group messaging platform, and Slack was mentioned the most often. And so, I went to visit Slack headquarters. I went to go see my friend Amir, who used to work there at the time, and I knocked on the door and I expected to see a company that was incredibly distracted because if it was the technology that was the source of the problem, nobody uses Slack more than Slack.

(01:02:52):
They should be the most distracted company on earth. But that's not what I found at all because Slack, in fact, embodied these three attributes. They gave people psychological safety. They gave people a forum to talk about these problems. How did they do that? They actually created Slack channels at Slack. They had one Slack channel called Beef Tweets, and Beef Tweets was a channel where people could talk about their beef with a company. And it wasn't that necessarily management had to fix every problem. That's not the point. It's that they had to acknowledge that employee's voices were being heard. And how did they do that? Surprisingly enough, they did it with emoji. So, when a problem that an employee mentioned was fixed, they sent the green check mark emoji, but if it was a problem that maybe couldn't be fixed, but what they wanted to acknowledge that management had seen it, they would send the eyes emoji.

(01:03:38):
And so, the important thing here is to give employees some kind of forum. It could be a Slack channel, it could be another case study in the book is the Boston Consulting Group, which I used to work at. They've gone from one of the most distractable companies to today. They're ranked as one of the best places to work in America. They have these meetings where they talk about PTO, predictable time off. And so, they completely changed that organizational culture by following these steps, as well. The last, the third attribute, which is the most important of the three, is that management must exemplify what it means to be indistractable because culture is like water. It flows downhill. And so, people will look to management to see how they behave, and they will act in accordance with those expectations. So, at Slack Company headquarters, in the company canteen, it says in bright pink letters, it says, "Work hard and go home."

(01:04:31):
Work hard and go home. That is not something you would expect to see at a hard charging Silicon Valley startup, but that's what you see there because everybody in the company, this was before the acquisition. I don't know what it's like now, but when I wrote the book, this was certainly the case that everybody from Stewart Butterfield on down, the CEO on down, believed that to do people's best work, they had to work without distraction. So, if you use Slack on nights and weekends, you were told, "That's not what we do here." You were reprimanded because that was not part of the company culture. So, it's really those three traits, psychological safety, a form to talk about these problems, and management has to exemplify what it means to be indistractable.

Lenny (01:05:04):
I want to move to a different topic, but before we do, is there one thing or maybe two things that a listener can do, say today or tomorrow or this week, that would make it significant dent on their ability to focus and avoid distraction?

Nir Eyal (01:05:18):
I would say understanding these four steps of master the internal triggers, make time for traction, hack back the external triggers, and preventing distraction with pacts. If you can do one small thing in each of those four strategies, one small thing, that's a wonderful, wonderful first step. You don't have to do everything in the book. I'm giving you many of different options, but one small thing in each of those categories is huge. Now, when it comes to the workplace, one of the benefits of making a time box calendar is that you have a physical artifact. You have something that you can print out and show to other people. And so, I hear this a lot when it comes to people who say, "Okay, I'm indistractable but my boss isn't, what do I do? I'm constantly ping and ding from my boss. How do I get control over my time?"

(01:06:02):
Here's what you do. This is called schedule syncing or managing your manager. Here's what happens. You print out your calendar or you show it to them on your screen, and you say, "Hey boss, I need 10 minutes with you, Monday morning. Is that okay? Can I get 10 minutes with you?" And now, what you're going to do is you're going to show them your time box calendar for your working hours. You're going to say, "Okay, boss, you see here's my time for email. Here's my time for that meeting you asked me to go to. Here's time for that big project I'm working on. Now, you see this other piece of paper? Okay, you see this other list here? This is a list of things you've asked me to do that I'm having trouble fitting into my calendar." So, what I'm helping you do here is avoiding the worst piece of personal productivity advice.

(01:06:40):
The worst piece of personal productivity advice is if you want to be better at time management, you need to learn how to say no. What kind of stupid advice is that? Only a tenured professor who can't get fired would give you that kind of stupid advice. If you tell your boss no, you're going to get fired, that's dumb. You don't tell your boss no, you ask your boss to help you prioritize. That is your boss' most important job is to prioritize. So, you're not saying no. You're saying, "Here's my calendar. Here's this list of stuff you've asked me to do. Help me prioritize." And here's what's going to happen. Your boss is going to look at your calendar and say, "You know what? That meeting, you really don't need to be at that meeting. But that thing on that piece of paper that you listed over here, that's way more important. Can you swap that out?"

(01:07:23):
And let me tell you, I've started three companies. I've sold two so far, and bosses, your manager will worship the ground you walk on because we're all wondering, "What is it that you're doing?" And I know we have to trust our employees, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. But we're still wondering, "Hey, that thing that you said was going to be done isn't done. Why not? How are you spending your time?" So, if you can proactively sit down with your boss so that they understand how you are spending your time, and again, this takes maybe 10 minutes, you do this schedule sync process that not only works really well in the workplace, it also works really well at home. So, my wife and I used to have conflicts over who's going to pick up our daughter, and why didn't you take out the trash? And we would have these conflicts because we didn't synchronize our schedules.

(01:08:07):
Well, now, we take maybe five minutes a week. Sunday evening, we sit down together. Let me look at your schedule. Let me look at my schedule. "Okay, now we're synchronized. It's amazing." We prevent so many conflicts just by doing this simple schedule sync process.

Lenny (01:08:20):
I love that advice. I recommend a very similar approach to people to align with their managers. Basically, I call it managing up. And the way I describe it, manager taught me this is, I call it prioritizing and communicating. You could prioritize and not communicate, and your manager would be like, "What the hell? Why didn't you do this thing?" It's, "I prioritized. I never told you. Here's where I put it on my list." Or you could just communicate like, "No," and that doesn't work as you said. The best combination is just like, "Here's what I'm doing, here's why I will prioritize this and let me know what you think. Would you agree? You want to move it up? You want to move it down?"

Nir Eyal (01:08:51):
Exactly. And how much input. We always talk about one of the reasons I hate to-do lists is because to-do lists are just a register of output. It's the stuff you want to have done, but you can't have output without input. If you go to a baker, let's say it's your kid's birthday party and say, "Hey, I want two dozen cupcakes." Well, the baker's going to say, "Okay, I need flour, I need sugar, I need butter. I need all these inputs in order to make the output." But somehow when it comes to knowledge work, we just add more and more outputs without considering the input. What is the input for knowledge work? It's only two things. It's your time and your attention. That's it. Your time and your attention. So, in order to get the output, we have to think about the input, which is why the schedule syncing and time boxing is so important. Again, that's something that a to-do list can never give you.

Lenny (01:09:36):
Awesome. Okay. For our last topic, I wanted to spend some time on Hooked, which I think could be its own podcast. That could be a whole other episode of your first book that did really well. And essentially, this book, Hooked, is about teaching people how to get people hooked on their product. I know that you have this very contrarian perspective on, are we actually addicted to technology? Is it hurting mental health? All these things. So, this is contrarian corner. I'd love to hear your perspective on just, why is it that we're not as hooked on social media and technology as people think?

Nir Eyal (01:10:08):
Yeah. Okay, so there's a lot there. So, let me explain what Hooked was for compared to Indistractable. So, Hooked is about how do we build habit-forming products for good. And so, the idea there was that I think we need to use more of these techniques when it comes to healthy behaviors. We want people to get hooked to a language learning app. Duolingo, one of my former clients. That's a great thing that they found ways to get people hooked to learning a new language compared to the way we used to learn languages. Getting people hooked to exercise. One of the case studies in Hooked is Fitbot, which is an app that helps people form these habits around exercise. Getting hooked to a personal finance app to help you save money, getting hooked to enterprise software. That's all great, right? If it helps you become more productive, helps you live a happier, healthier life, that's wonderful.

(01:10:53):
So, nobody's worried about people getting addicted to enterprise SaaS. That's not an issue. So, the vast majority of products out there, they're not worried about addicting anyone. The real problem the vast majority of businesses out there have is that nobody cares. They have a wonderful product that could really improve people's lives, but people aren't using it. And so, it's really about how do you get people to keep coming back to your product or service, not because they have to, but because they want to. And so, what essentially I do at Hooked is steal the secrets of these Silicon Valley giants. I literally ripped out their psychology to understand what makes their products work so well, so that everybody in every conceivable industry that is devoted to improving people's lives can use those habits for good. So, that's what Hooked is for. So, if Hooked is about good habits, Indistractable is about how do we break bad habits, but for different products, we want to build a good habit with the exercise app, with these SaaS app, with the good habits, and we also want to break the bad habits.

(01:11:49):
So, that's the two sides of the same coin. They're not negations, they're complements. And I think I am uniquely qualified to write both these books because I know these techniques work and I know where they don't work. And I can tell you, having written Hooked, these techniques are very good. They're very effective. They're not that good. This isn't mind control. We're not hijacking people's brains. And there's a lot of people out there, a lot of tech critics have made a lot of money and gotten a lot of speaking gigs over scaring the crap out of people because people love that stuff. I was a journalism co-major in college, and the first rule of journalism is if it bleeds, it leads. So, you can get a lot more attention and a lot more press, a lot more invites to Ted Talks if you tell people, "Technology is melting your brain, it's super evil. Let's shut it all down."

(01:12:40):
This is the classic chicken little story. People love that stuff. The truth is much more nuanced, but nobody likes nuance. Nobody likes the answer to every complex question, which is always the same. "It depends. It depends." For some people, overusing technology is a real problem. So, for people who are pathologically addicted, that can be very harmful because, what is the definition of addiction? An addiction is a compulsive dependency on a behavior or substance that harms the user. Now, that's about 3% to 5% of the population is pathologically addicted, but we toss out this word addiction all the time. Everything's addictive. My wife ordered a shoes from DSW, and on the box it says, "Danger, addictive contents inside." It's shoes, people. Shoes. And so, what we have done by pathologizing, by medicalizing this behavior is that now, everything's an addiction. "Oh, you like playing Candy Crush? It's addictive. You like social media. It's addictive."

(01:13:37):
No, it's not addictive to everyone. No more than saying, "Hey, a lot of people have a glass of wine with dinner, but not everyone's an alcoholic. So, why do we think everyone who uses social media is addicted?" They're not. But we love that terminology. We love it. Why? Because even the word addiction comes from the Latin addictio, which means slave. So, it's much easier to tell ourselves, "I'm enslaved. My brain is being hijacked. My focus is being stolen. It's all Silicon Valley's fault." As opposed to saying, "Wait a minute, this isn't really a distraction." I'm sorry. "It's not really an addiction, it's a distraction," because then now I have personal responsibility. Now, I have to do something about it. That's no fun. Can I just blame somebody? But for the vast majority of people, save the people who are actually pathologically addicted, which by the way, I do think we need special protections for. If you're not a child who I do think we need special protections for, and you're not pathologically addicted, this is a personal responsibility issue that thankfully, all of us can overcome if we have the right tools.

Lenny (01:14:33):
Wow, this is quite the contrarian juicy corner. I wish we had more time to dig into all this stuff. So, basically, I checked Twitter a lot. I checked my phone a lot. You're saying that essentially, don't call it addiction. I'm just finding more things to get distracted by to push away from all these uncomfortable emotions that I'm feeling doing hard work.

Nir Eyal (01:14:52):
That's exactly right. And again, it doesn't mean it's your fault, but it is your responsibility as we talked about earlier, because who else's responsibility is it? We love these simple narratives. We love these simple stories of something bad is happening, so this is the bad guy. Well, sometimes the bad guy is also us, or at least we have a role to play in taking responsibility for this stuff. And so, if it was something that is insurmountable, if something you can't do anything about, for example, children, I think children are a protected class. My fifteen-year-old can't walk into a bar and order a gin and tonic. She can't walk into a casino and start playing blackjack. She's not ready for that. So, I do think we need regulations to protect children. I think we also need protections around people who are actually pathologically addicted.

(01:15:35):
If you know people are getting addicted to your product, you do have an ethical responsibility. And I've written about this for the past 10 years now about specific legislation that I think we need around what's called a use and abuse policy for people who are pathologically addicted. But for 95% of us, it's not an addiction. It's something we can absolutely take control over if we want to and if we have the right tools.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Very interesting food for thoughts. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with?

Nir Eyal (01:16:06):
There's a wonderful quote that I really love from Paulo Coelho who said that, "A mistake repeated more than once is a decision." A mistake repeated more than once is a decision, such a great quote. And I think it's time that we realize that if we are not doing something about this problem, we are deciding to be distractable. The difference between an indistractable person and a distractable person is that an indistractable person says, "Ah, okay, I see what you did to me there. I see I got distracted. I'm not going to let it happen again." How many times can we get distracted by social media, by whatever, before we say, "Okay, I'm going to take steps today to prevent getting distracted tomorrow"? That's what defines an indistractable person. So, if you really want to summarize my work in Indistractable into one Mantra, it's that the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. The antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. Fundamentally, distraction is an impulse control issue. That's all it is, and it's a skill like any other.

(01:17:04):
We learn skills. Why do we expect that we should just be born with this innate skill to fight distraction? It's a skill like any other. And so, the antidote for impulsiveness is forethought. If we plan ahead, if we know that we're going to take steps a day to prevent getting distracted tomorrow, there's no distraction we can't overcome.

Lenny (01:17:22):
I love it. I love the message of empowerment and agency. I feel like that's so applicable to product management and a lot of the people that listen to this podcast. And just another example of that even though the world is making life more difficult for us, potentially, you could still do something about it. And I really like just the general message that you can do something about it. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Nir Eyal (01:17:44):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:17:45):
All right. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Nir Eyal (01:17:48):
There's this book called Alchemy by Rory Sutherland that I love. It's a fantastic book. It delves into the psychology of various experiences. So, highly recommend that. And I'm reading a book right now, actually. It's all myself right here called The Experience Machine by Andy Clark, which I'm really enjoying.

Lenny (01:18:04):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Nir Eyal (01:18:08):
Okay, so it's not very recent, but it's one of my all time favorite movies that nobody's seen, which is Empire of the Sun. Have you ever seen Empire of the Sun?

Lenny (01:18:16):
Nope.

Nir Eyal (01:18:17):
Okay, you got to see it. So, one of my favorite movies, it has Christian Bale in it when he was only, I think, 12 or 13 years old. Steven Spielberg was the director, John Malkovich stars in it. Unbelievable movie that for some reason nobody saw. So, if you're a Christian Bale fan, which I am, I think he's a fantastic actor, Empire of the Sun, classic, awesome movie.

Lenny (01:18:38):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're hiring them for a job?

Nir Eyal (01:18:43):
I'm not a big fan of interviews in general. I'm a huge fan of small projects. So, what I'll oftentimes do is pay people to do a small project and then I can see their work output. I find that that works much, much better than any question I can come up with.

Lenny (01:18:59):
Awesome. A few other people have mentioned that exact idea, especially at a company. I think about Linea, where they pay people to do a little project within their company. They're kind of like contractors for the company for a little bit.

Nir Eyal (01:19:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or something physical?

Nir Eyal (01:19:15):
I went to Japan a few months ago and I just became obsessed with all things Japanese, and so I bought a hundred different little gadgets that helped me make Japanese food at home. So, I had this little sesame grinder thing. The Japanese are so good at making devices for everything, so I would just put this under the general bucket of everything Japanese.

Lenny (01:19:36):
I use Muji pens, which is an amazing Japanese brand. They're just like...

Nir Eyal (01:19:43):
Yes, we have Muji. Yes, exactly. I have some of those, as well. They're great.

Lenny (01:19:44):
Go Japan. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either at work or life, that you find really useful?

Nir Eyal (01:19:52):
So, I do have several mantras that I repeat to myself daily. One of those is my life purpose. My purpose in life is to explain the world so that it can be made better. Now, that might not apply to everyone. That's my personal life motto. It kind of just helps me recenter and refocus my purpose for living, which is to serve others, to make the world a better place. And the way I do that is to explain the world so that it can be made better. So, of course, that's not going to apply to everyone, but I do think there is something very useful about sitting down and saying, "Wait, what is the purpose of my life?" And so, for me, having that mantra, which I literally repeat every single day as like a little prayer, I'm very secular. I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I think there's a lot of wisdom to be adopted from the practices of organized religion, and one of those is this secular prayer reminding me of my purpose.

Lenny (01:20:36):
I love that. Final question. You wrote a book about building habits. What's your best and worst habit these days?

Nir Eyal (01:20:45):
This is tricky. So, I think the reason I'm struggling answering this is because there's a difference between habits and routines and a lot of things that people think are habits are not really habits. So, I was going to say exercise. I used to be clinically obese and now I exercise. But that's not technically a habit because it's not done with little or no conscious thought. It's a routine, but I think that's probably one of my best routines is that I've finally, for the first time in my life, really gotten into physical fitness. I have maybe not quite a six-pack, but maybe like a four-pack at forty-five years old. I'm pretty proud of that and I'm not saying that to brag. I'm saying it as a testimony to the fact that when you say you're going to do something and actually do it, how wonderful that feels.

(01:21:29):
Just live your life with intent. I'm not athletic. I never was athletic. I still don't really like exercise, but I do it and I eat right because I say I will. So, I think that's probably my best routine and probably my worst habit is that I still feel these impulses. If the definition of a habit is an impulse to do or behavior with little or no conscious thought, you better well damn believe that I feel the impulse to check Instagram for a quick minute or to look at this. I still feel that. I think the difference is that now, I know I'm going to feel those. I know that's part of my daily experience, and I have those practices in place so that they don't get the best of me.

Lenny (01:22:04):
Just along those lines, something I was going to ask but I forgot is, how often do you not do the things you had in your calendar? What percentage of the things don't get done the way you planned?

Nir Eyal (01:22:12):
So, when things change dramatically, then I tend to fall off track. So, the first time, if I make a big change in my calendar, I'm much more likely to fall off track. The more I can go from week to week with small parts of my calendar changing, the more I'll get to a hundred percent doing what I say I'm going to do. But I would say on average, once I have, I pretty much have my more or less calendar set for the week. I would say maybe 10% of the tasks I'll go a little too late on or I'll start, but then of course the idea is to make sure that doesn't happen again next time.

(01:22:41):
But there is, of course, some wiggle room. So, when that might happen, let's say it's 10% of the time I go off track, well then I'll say, "You know what? I put in too much time for writing. An hour of writing is too much. Maybe I should just start with 45 minutes. Let's see if I can do that block. I'll adjust it a little bit because I got other stuff that I want to take care of." So, it's those small adjustments within day-to-day, whereas before I wrote Indistractable, it was all kinds of stuff. It was half the day that I would go off track.

Lenny (01:23:07):
Amazing. I was going to ask what it was like beforehand. Nir, I think we delivered on our promise. There's at least a dozen very tactical things you can do to become more indistractable and to focus better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about the stuff you're doing? Where do they buy your book? Where they learn more about the things you can do for them? And then finally, how can listeners be sold to you?

Nir Eyal (01:23:28):
I appreciate it. Thanks. So, my website is nirandfar.com. That's spelled like my first name, nirandfar.com. And my two books, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, and they're available wherever books are sold and what you can do for me, become indistractable. Honestly, I don't care if you buy the book. If you can adopt some of these practices and help change this mindset that we're all victims, that we're being hijacked because of the tech companies. If you can start putting the word out there that this is something that has improved your life in some small way and tell others about it, this is how we start spreading those social antibodies, just like my mom did around smoking. I think we should all do the same.

Lenny (01:24:09):
I am going to be working on that as soon as we get off. Nir, thank you so much for being here.

Nir Eyal (01:24:14):
Thank you.

# The happiness and pain of product management | Noam Lovinsky (Grammarly, FB, Thumbtack, YT)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
You've worked at so many great companies. At YouTube, when you joined, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:05):
There were many times where Google leadership reconsidered the acquisition and, "Should we sell YouTube?" if you can believe it or not.

Lenny (00:00:11):
At Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:15):
I remember in a board meeting, the new model really started to show legs and one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever seen.

Lenny (00:00:23):
When you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team trying to create a startup within a startup.

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:29):
You're thinking on a different time horizon. If you're a large organization and you do some performance management process twice a year and you're 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive.

Lenny (00:00:39):
As the chief product officer of Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspelled?

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:47):
The.

Lenny (00:00:47):
You do T-E-H?

Noam Lovinsky (00:00:48):
T-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Oh man.

(00:00:53):
Today my guest is Noam Lovinsky. Noam is currently chief product officer at Grammarly. Previously, he was an early PM at YouTube where he spent five years leading the creator product experience and then the broader YouTube consumer product experience. He then went on to take on the chief product officer role at Thumbtack, which involved helping the company reignite growth after a downturn caused by some changes Google made in SEO. He then went on to Facebook where he created the New Product Experimentation team whose charter was to incubate big new ideas protected from the larger Facebook org.

(00:01:26):
Noam has such a unique set of experiences taking products from 0 to 1, from -1 to 1, from 1 to 100, and even starting his own companies. He's never really been on a podcast before and he rarely ever tweets or post anything online, which we actually talk about. In our conversation, we walk through the lessons that he's learned through his amazing career at YouTube, Facebook, Thumbtack, and at Grammarly. We talk about when it makes sense to kill your project at a company, when it makes sense to ask to be layered at a company, why you should be keeping a nose out for which products matter most at a business and to find those products, why you need to diversify your growth channels at your business, why you should be finding work that is going to most stretch you to help you advance in your career, a bunch of advice for creating space for innovation within a large company and so much more. Noam is such a gem and I'm really excited to share his wisdom with you.

(00:04:22):
Noam, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Noam Lovinsky (00:04:25):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:27):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've heard so many great things about you from so many people. I think you're friends with a lot of guests that have been on this podcast. Something that I find really interesting about you and really respect about you is that you've worked at so many great companies and you've done so many big things in your career, but you barely ever tweet. You don't have a newsletter. I don't see many things on LinkedIn. I don't think you've even been on a podcast before. I think the only evidence I can find that you exist is you have this YouTube channel that's just like you go-karting and kids and people wishing you a happy birthday.

Noam Lovinsky (00:05:00):
Oh gosh, I should go monitor that. I forgot about that.

Lenny (00:05:05):
You might want to go find it now.

Noam Lovinsky (00:05:09):
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's funny. Yeah, it's funny. I think about that a lot, like am I doing something wrong? Should I be putting more effort in that? I mean, it's funny that you mentioned newsletter. I spend a lot of time with the Substack team's. I've been a very active advisor there. The team is fantastic by the way. And I think about it. Am I doing something wrong in my career by not doing that? But just to be honest, it doesn't come authentically to me. It doesn't come naturally to me. I get really focused on the thing that I'm working on and get really deep in the thing that I am working on and I have a hard time kind of multitasking a lot outside of that to be totally honest. The way that I kind of get to know the industry and other teams or whatnot is just through working with people.

(00:05:58):
I'm not a very big networker. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that. I wish I were better at that. I get to know people by doing work with them, by helping them. And it doesn't necessarily scale in the same way that Twitter does, but it's served me well so far and it's more kind of authentic and it's what comes more natural to me. And so that's how I do it. So I'm doing a lot of coffees. I'm meeting people that way. I'm not doing a lot of tweeting or writing of newsletters. Maybe one day, but that's not me today.

Lenny (00:06:31):
So I think this is an awesome example of you can be incredibly successful as a product manager and as anyone in tech not investing time posting online. I am going to incriminate myself here, but I feel like the advice I always share with people is the best people are not spending time tweeting and talking online and sharing on LinkedIn. They're just doing the work. They don't have time for that sort of thing. And I think you're a great example of that. Is there anything along those lines that you share with folks that are just like, "Hey, should I be investing time here?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:06:59):
I think everyone can chart their own path and has a way that is sort of authentic to them and leans on their strengths. What I often coach people is, do what you like. You're generally going to be a lot better at the things that really fill you up that really get you excited. Life is short. There's so many things to be doing out there. We're so lucky. The number of interesting waves of technology that I've experienced, it just makes me feel like it's going to keep happening for a long time. We're very fortunate to be born in the time that we are and have the opportunities that we are. So why spend your time doing something that doesn't feel good because you think that it might lead to some success, where if you lean on what's authentic to you and what makes you happy, chances are you're going to be one of the best people at those things?

Lenny (00:07:49):
I love that advice. And I think it's so important. I think there's a lot of pressure on people too. "I need to do this, I need to do that."

Noam Lovinsky (00:07:49):
Totally.

Lenny (00:07:55):
"I need to tweet, I need to share content to be successful." This comes up a lot in this podcast, that the more you could just stick close to what gives you energy and what you enjoy doing, oftentimes that leads to things you wouldn't expect in a lot of success.

(00:08:07):
Speaking of that, looking at your career arc, I noticed a really interesting pattern and a really diverse set of experiences. So just kind of talking through places you've been. At Facebook, you worked on 0 to 1 stuff. At YouTube, the way I see it as you almost went from -1 to 1. At Thumbtack, it looks like you went from 1 to -1 and then back to 1. So it's like a really unique turnaround story. And then with Grammarly it feels like it's like, I don't know, 1 or I don't know, 5 to 100, or wherever you end up taking it. So I thought it'd be fun to talk through each of these experiences because they're such unique approaches or such unique experiences and see what lessons and wisdom we can extract from your journey.

Noam Lovinsky (00:08:51):
That sounds great. Yeah.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Okay, sweet. So I'm thinking reverse chronologically, we start with YouTube, which the way I see it is it's kind of -1 to 1. When you join, my understanding is YouTube was losing a lot of money. When you left, they were not losing money. And I was actually just looking, they're valued apparently at $200 billion today, YouTube as a business. I know you haven't been there for a while, but great work. What lessons did you take away from that journey? What stories come to mind from that part of your career that might be helpful to people?

Noam Lovinsky (00:09:21):
Maybe first to start looking with why hop around these experiences. I always tell people I feel like I'm an IC trapped in a manager's body sometimes. Fundamentally, I like to build, that's why I do this. I like to make things. And so sometimes the more fun way to make things is to start something and sometimes the better way to make things in the situation that I'm in is to try to support teams and lead through teams.

(00:09:50):
And so I joined YouTube through an acquisition of a company I started. In the beginning, what I was doing there is just rebuilding that product on Google infrastructure and for YouTube customers. And maybe the first lesson was actually to look around at what the rest of the team was doing and be really honest and open about the relative priority of the thing that you're working on even if it might lead to your project getting canceled.

(00:10:26):
So one of the things that I remember doing really on is actually talking to the leadership team and being like, "I don't think we should be putting 50 engineers on this project. Looking at the rest of the roadmap and the rest of the priorities, excuse me, I think this team would likely be better served elsewhere." Even though that was likely negotiating my way out of a job in month three, I don't know, I kind of felt like that was the right thing for the team and for the business.

(00:10:57):
And then that started a very interesting journey because from there, basically the leadership was like, "You're right. We're going to wind that down and build some of those features into the existing product. And now you, you come and lead this focus area, we're calling the creator focus area." So I went from basically rebuilding the product that our startup had built to leading one of the three focus areas at YouTube. There was the viewer team, the creator team, and the advertiser team. And Hunter Walk, who's amazing, was leading the viewer team. And Shishir Mehrotra, who's also very amazing, was leading the advertising team.

Lenny (00:11:39):
What an alumni community.

Noam Lovinsky (00:11:41):
There was me. I was sort of like 29-year-old startupy guy working with these guys who were awesome. And YouTube in general, and continues to be, an incredible team. And so I think that was a first really good lesson. That in the right organizations, even in large organizations, advocate for what's best for the team, advocate for what's best for the organization even if that means that it puts you at a particular difficult moment. If it is a healthy team that rewards those sorts of decisions and actions, good things will happen. If it's not, that's good to know too. That's good to know early. So that's one thing that comes to mind.

(00:12:32):
Maybe one other I would say atypical career choice that I made shortly thereafter is then when I was put in that role, I really struggled in that role. I was reporting to the CEO at the time, a guy named Salar Kamangar, who's also awesome, Google's 6th employee and just learned a ton from him, like an incredible strategic thinker. But he was asking me questions that I felt like they were from a different planet. I was like, I didn't know what they meant and he just thought in a different way, a different level or different scale and that's still something that I was learning. Eventually I figured it out, but I was really struggling in that moment. I had a really good relationship with both Hunter and Shishir and they really helped me through that. And eventually, I went to Salar and said, "Hey, I think I should actually report to Hunter. I think this would work better if we kind of combined the organizations this way and then we divided and conquered this way."

(00:13:41):
And again, very atypical, no one has ever come to me in my career and said, "I would like you to layer me in this other person." But in that moment I was just like, "This is how I will do better work. This is how I will get better support. I will be happier and more productive and it'll be better for the team." And you know what? For me anyway, I was right. We made that change. Hunter was a fantastic manager and support at YouTube. I learned a ton, grew a lot. And then eventually when he moved on, Shishir took over the organization and then I moved into the viewer part of the organization, which is where I spent the rest of my time there, which was leading and supporting the viewer PM team at YouTube.

Lenny (00:14:32):
These stories are amazing. It connects to your point that you're kind of an, I see, an inner child I see, where you keep trying to kill your career by accident. Like, "Now, let's kill this project I'm working on. I'm going to demote myself a little bit." But clearly it's worked out. Is there anything that you saw that gave you that confidence that, "This is actually going to be okay"? Because again, people don't normally think this is how you get ahead in your career, is you kill your team and you layer yourself.

Noam Lovinsky (00:14:58):
Yeah, I mean I think having a broader view of the company strategy, having an instinct for what we should be doing and why and how I might prioritize all of these investments if I were given the opportunity to do that, I think internalizing that and understanding that and then trying to align whatever is under your influence towards that overall goal is very helpful and made me feel like, "I'm pretty confident this is going to be okay because it will lead to better results for the organization given what we're trying to do. And so as long as I'm trying to push decisions or actions that actually lead to better results, if it's a healthy culture and organization, I should be okay."

(00:15:47):
I think that the other thing is, just over the years, I got extremely lucky. The first job that I got out of school was an incredible group of people and it gave me a nose for talent. It gave me a nose for what great feels like and what a high functioning team feels like. It's hard to know that without experiencing that. And so in the moments, YouTube was also one of those teams, Grammarly is one of those teams, Thumbtack was one of those teams. Being able to sniff that out when you're trying to choose the next team is very important. But I think that's another thing that gave me confidence. I learned these people well enough, Hunter, Shishir, et cetera, to have the instinct that the right thing will happen, like this will be better for me and the broader team.

Lenny (00:16:49):
Got it. So the key there is just you have to trust that the team around you is good enough, that you're not going to be pushed off into a corner. I think you made a really profound point here that a lot of people don't get about the job of a product leader and a product manager, that a big part of your job is to think about what is best for the business and work backwards from that. Not necessarily what's the best thing for the user is the highest priority, not necessarily what's the best thing for my team and how do I hit the goals that I'm obsessed with. It's what is going to be best for the business broadly and then make decisions there. Is there anything more you can say there about just how powerful that is as a way of thinking about prioritization and decisions as a product manager?

Noam Lovinsky (00:17:31):
Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I think ideally, things that are best for the customer, there's high overlap with that with things that are best for the business, but not always, right? And I think figuring out some principles that help guide those sorts of conflicts can be really, really helpful. At Thumbtack, we had principles about which sides of the marketplace we wanted to serve in which order and when we serve Thumbtack. So it was customers first, pros second, and then Thumbtack last. And that's actually the first two... Saying Thumbtack last is the easy thing to say. Actually doing it in action I think is a very different thing. But that first one of like, should we... Especially when you're starting a marketplace, as you know well, Lenny, supply is so critical. Many marketplaces live and die by the quality and liquidity and supply. And so why would you focus on customers first and the Thumbtack perspective and supply are the pros, the people that you hire?

(00:18:41):
Well, we always just felt that what the pros need from us is more customers. What the pros need from us is high quality customers. And so if we really try to make a great customer experience that attracts more customers, helps them find the right pros, provides the highest quality customers, then that will therefore be better for the pros. And so that's how we should prioritize. If we do those things right, then the business will benefit, right? And so doing things like raising prices because we think it's good for the business, even though it causes liquidity issues in the marketplace might be a little bit of a local maxima, locally optimizing rather than globally optimizing. So I think sometimes in these sorts of questions, trying to establish some set of guiding principles that help navigate some of these more ambiguous or thorny questions can be really helpful.

Lenny (00:19:38):
I want to circle back to this first point you made, an experience you had convincing people that your first project shouldn't be something you work on. How long do you stick with something that isn't going well and then decide, "Okay, let's convince people this is something I should move on from," versus you don't want to give up on a project quickly, you want to give it a shot?

Noam Lovinsky (00:19:56):
I mean, look, I don't know that it's a perfect answer, but I think the reality is just that what kills most projects most early companies is stamina. And I think that we all need to work on being more resilient about kind of like, I remember at Thumbtack, Marco, the CEO, we used to say that it feels like we're running uphill and chewing glass, and you're kind of like, "That's right, we want to do that. That's good for us. Take our medicine." So you want to practice that sort of resiliency. But ultimately, I think that what starts to happen is you start to lose the stamina and you're just not bringing your best self to the situation.

(00:20:42):
And so many of these things that are so high ambiguity where you don't know exactly what to build or you don't know exactly, you're not getting the signal you need or the feedback you need to be able to hone it in and know that you're doing something well. They require just an ungodly level of faith and stamina. And so that's sort of what I look to. When you see a team that is motivated, that is building something like they're really excited about, I mean just the inertia, the quality, it's like a whole different game where when you see a team that's sort of down and out and they've really been hitting their head against the wall for a long time, sometimes they just need a change of scene, a change of pace, and they get to a much better situation. So my honest answer is, yeah, it's the, when do you run out of steam is usually the question. I think that happens usually like in the startup case, a lot of times before you run out money or these other things.

Lenny (00:21:48):
We've talked about Thumbtack a couple of times now, so let's talk about that. I love this description of running a pill, chewing glass. My understanding is when you joined, things were going well, and then things started to go much less well, and then you helped turn things around. Talk about that part of your journey and what you learned from that time.

Noam Lovinsky (00:22:05):
Yeah, sure. Again, really fantastic team and really strong founders. That company was just on the bleeding edge of things like SEO and growing by SEO. It was one of the best organizations that are driving growth through that channel. But I think a thing that I learned really early, which Lenny with your background you probably know as well, SEO is a sort of a live by the sword, die by the sword channel of growth. I think that one channel growth company is always a no-no. And so that's a little bit of what we had at Thumbtack.

(00:22:44):
So it was funny, because I remember when I joined and Marco and I had an agreement where it's like, "Okay, I'm going to do my three months of onboarding, listening to our new leader inheriting a team." I've always gotten advice that that's what you should do. And Marco being an entrepreneur and a hard running founder is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure." And then a month in, it's like, "All right, we got to run 2024 planning. Go." Or not 2024, sorry, at the time it was. And yeah, in the early days when I was there, Thumbtack was seeing triple digit growth. Then we had a couple SEO hits that got us down to double-digit growth. And then not too long after that, we were actually, for the first time in the company's history, seeing negative year-over-year growth and Google was just really coming down on our category as we were, by the way, trying to rebuild the whole product and change the monetization model and everything in between.

(00:23:50):
So it was a really a tough moment of how much do we kind of spend to reinforce the old model while we're sort of building the new model, kind of changing the engine while the plane is flying. I think I remember in a board meeting, once we kind of turned that around and over time and also the new model really started to show legs and really started to work, one of the board members, Brian Schreier at Sequoia, said it was the prettiest smile graph that he had ever, ever seen. It was obviously a really proud moment there.

(00:24:24):
But I think that the thing that I took away from that, which I tell PMs quite a bit, is growth masks all problems. You don't really have a, I think, true understanding of what is working well and what is not working well when you have incredible growth. YouTube was a great example of that. And at Thumbtac, it had incredible growth for quite some time, but it was essentially burning through a lot of demand. It was just dropping a lot of demand on the floor because there wasn't sufficient liquidity on the supply side to really meet that demand. The team knew and was trying to work on that problem, but it wasn't as urgent or high priority because you're having triple digit growth. What's wrong? Everything's going great, right?

(00:25:11):
And then the moment growth starts to slow or certainly when growth starts to be negative, all of a sudden the tenor in the organization really changes and you start looking at things very differently and trying to understand what's actually going on. And so I think it's actually a very healthy thing for businesses to go through as they turn into long-term sustainable businesses to have those sorts of moments, because I think otherwise it's just really challenging to identify where the true issues are. And I think as a PM, if you've only ever worked on things that grow and you've never felt the other side of that and how to help turn that around with your team, I think you lose a lot in your career if you don't experience that.

(00:25:58):
I'm kind of naturally paranoid. And especially as I manage growth, I often look at things and ask myself like, "Okay, what do I do right now if it went negative? How would I prioritize things if it went negative?" Having gone through that experience, I just look at things in a different way of urgency. I look at things at different levels of priority having gone through that experience.

Lenny (00:26:25):
With this Thumbtack story, I think it's rare that a business gets the smile graph that you described, this prettiest smile graph that this board member has ever seen. I think that is rarely the case. Usually, it doesn't come back up. Can you share what you did to help Thumbtack turn things around? I know it's very particular to Thumbtack in the business, but just anything there that would be useful to people?

Noam Lovinsky (00:26:46):
Sure. First of all, this is very much the team. It's not just things that I did. So I mean, first was turning on multiple channels of growth. Up until then, Thumbtack had tried and stopped paid channels, other organic channels like referrals, all of the typical things. And so, we just went back to first principles on a lot of that and also just kind of reformed a team around that and basically got an amazing team together. One of them, Whitney Steele is running marketing at Descript now. Another one, David Schein is running a product at HIMSS. But basically I went back to first principles on some of those growth channels and experiment on our way to much, much better results.

(00:27:42):
I think that one of the things that we were doing incorrectly at Thumbtack is Thumbtack is actually a marketplace that is actually made up of thousands of marketplaces, right? Like DJs in Philadelphia is one marketplace, DJs in Atlanta is another marketplace, contractors in Sonoma is another marketplace. And then Thumbtack is obviously the container of all of those marketplaces. I think we were just bifurcating our targeting and our growth efforts a little too narrowly, assuming we had to grow in that way market by market rather than targeting more broadly, providing the more aggregate data to Google and others, and then optimizing from there. The fact that we already had really good showing in SEO and really good patriarch and SEO helped to bolster things like SEM and then eventually Facebook as well.

(00:28:40):
Those were kind of the growth levers, but the core issue with the Thumbtack product was that it was just a very high friction customer experience that really left customers waiting. So the way that Thumbtack worked basically was a customer would find them through a search query, they would come in and they would answer a number of questions about the job they needed done, and then Thumbtack would say, "Okay, great, we'll get back to you in 24 hours." And this is a modern day experience, right?

(00:29:17):
And then what Thumbtack would do is they would take that job and they would federate it out to as many of the pros that might match the criteria, and then the pros would pay to quote to show up as a potential provider for that job. Now, I don't want to take anything away from that team because that worked phenomenally well for a really long time. And actually it's a perfect case study in like, "|Just do the scrappy thing that works to grow." And they did that very well, but the stage and size of the business when I joined it had kind of outgrown that. And the team knew that. That's obviously a very high friction experience. The idea that the customer, they're super excited, they want to hire someone, and at that moment you'd be like, "Cool, talk to you soon," not the best experience.

(00:30:06):
And the fact that you're asking your supply to put up money to even show up to customers in the first place, well, what the customers want to see is the supply. Like, "Tell me who I can hire." Also, a lot of friction on that side and also in some cases some unfair revenue on that side because if folks are paying to be seen and maybe they're looked at, but there's not really high intent, then they're not going to get the customers they want, they're going to be spending revenue, they're not going to be getting revenue back. It turns into just a bad loop obviously.

(00:30:40):
So the main thing we did is to rebuild that whole loop, change the monetization model, build a system where essentially pros could provide instant quotes. Lenny, I'm sure from Airbnb, this is very familiar, the move from request to book to instant booking. It was a very similar thing in a different kind of category of service and supply obviously. But that shift and doing that shift across those thousands of marketplaces and then finding the right friction point for monetization and when and what to charge people for and all of that change, that is what really, at its core, turned the growth engine around at Thumbtack. And it's just a real testament to those founders that they believe that, saw that, and were willing to run a pill and chew glass to get to that point. I don't know the details of the business anymore. And if I did, I wouldn't speak to it. But from what I hear, things are going well, so I think that that served the company well.

Lenny (00:31:45):
Yeah, as you were talking about that, that's exactly an experience Airbnb went through. I actually led that effort at Airbnb. It took three years of my life.

Noam Lovinsky (00:31:53):
Oh my gosh, we should talk about that one day.

Lenny (00:31:57):
Yeah, I've written about it here and there, but honestly very quietly is one of the biggest transformations Airbnb went through, shifting from I'm going to go request a book to basically every book now on Airbnb is instant. And that was a very difficult and painful journey. But looking back, I don't think Airbnb would've made it if not for that. And unlike Thumbtack, we did it before things were starting to fall apart. And actually, I was going to say the lens that we used that I find really helpful here is, you should be asking yourself, "If somebody was to come into our space and disrupt us and start now to become the new Airbnb, what would they do?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:32:33):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:32:34):
And it was obvious that it'd be be make it instant, just the way it works. Welcome to Airbnb disruptor. And so, yeah.

Noam Lovinsky (00:32:40):
Another learning there is any product you work on that involves bits and atoms is exponentially harder than products that just involve bits. But it's amazing how something as seemingly simple as make an instant ends up being so incredibly deep and complicated. And especially on an existing business, making that transition while still growing is just very, very complicated. Fantastic learning I'm sure you had as well.

Lenny (00:33:07):
Very difficult to change people's expectations and behavior. This could be its own podcast episode, just changing marketplaces into an instant experience.

(00:33:14):
I wanted to circle back real quick to the first lesson you had there, which is adding new channels. I think this is a really interesting takeaway here. So essentially Thumbtack was reliant on SEO. Google slash the sword, as you described, started changing things so traffic stopped coming. I think a cool lesson here is just if you're reliant on one growth channel, which I think most companies actually are, I think most companies have one main driver, I think a lesson here is potentially before things start to fall apart, especially if you're SEO-driven, start to explore more practically paid referrals.

Noam Lovinsky (00:33:46):
Totally. I mean I think maybe it's, again, it's kind of living through that. Now, anytime I look at a product or look at a team, it's one of the first things that perks up the paranoia of just like, "Oh no. You don't want to be in that situation. Let's figure out now how you start to diversify because you just never know, like you say, when one of those might dry up."

Lenny (00:34:09):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn.

(00:34:20):
LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2 to 5X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:35:29):
Is there anything else from your time at Thumbtack that stands out as an interesting lesson or takeaway that you bring with you to the work you do now?

Noam Lovinsky (00:35:37):
I would say this, I think especially at the leadership level, the team that reports to the CEO, that group doesn't always have the opportunity to do a lot of project work together, right? You've got your CFO, you've got your head of sales, you've got your product and your engineering. There's just not as often as natural ways for that group to work together. And then when something happens like growth goes negative, that group is very important. And that group's ability to tackle hard things together is very important. I think that one important lesson from that is, no one can be a bystander on product strategy. Just because you've got product in your title doesn't mean you're the only one that should be thinking about product strategy certainly at that level. Certainly not in engineering.

(00:36:39):
The CFO, the head of people, everyone needs to have a seat at the table when it comes to product strategy, what the company's doing and what they're going to do to grow out of the situation that they're in. Because otherwise, in those hard times it can kind of be like a, "What have you done for me lately?" sort of a dynamic. And that's just not the right dynamic to have on that team. I'm not saying that at Thumbtack we had the right dynamic, but I think it was a really important learning in that moment of how that team, even if they didn't typically get as involved in things like product strategy and what we're building, how everyone had to be all hands on deck and really thinking about those sorts of problems because it's the only way I think you can get a whole company and team out of those situations by everyone getting involved in doing their part and pulling on the levers that they have in their area in order to do that well. I don't think it can work in any other way.

Lenny (00:37:38):
So there's a lesson there. Build a relationship with the leadership team before things start to go awry.

Noam Lovinsky (00:37:44):
That, yes. Certainly that, but I think it's also incumbent for people in our roles and engineering roles to bring strategy to that discussion, to that group, in a way that it is possible for everyone to engage and everyone to internalize and understand what it means for their area and to even have obviously a say in because they're on the leadership team at the end of the day. They should feel like their fingerprint is also on the company strategy, and as soon as it starts to feel like that's their world, that's our world. And I think that's true for any of the functions. It's true for what's happening in sales, it's true for what's happening in marketing. As product managers, we naturally need to be the connective tissue across all of that, but I think the whole leadership team at that level should feel like connective tissue across all of those functions.

Lenny (00:38:39):
Okay. Let's transition to Facebook. This is I think an example of 0 to 1. So when you were at Facebook, you built what is called the New Product Experimentation team. I actually thought it was called the New Product Experiment Experience team, but I think it's New Product Experimentation team. My understanding is the idea there is, instead of Facebook having to buy the next Instagram and WhatsApp and all the things basically incubate startups within Facebook in a stabled concept, a startup within a startup, create all these startups within a startup. And as an outsider, it feels like it was really fun for a while, but it hasn't let any amazing new businesses for Facebook. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm curious what that experience was like, what you took away from it, how it went, what you think about when you look back at that part of your journey.

Noam Lovinsky (00:39:28):
I was one of the few folks that kind of joined that team early and help build that team. How it ended up and how it closed down, I am not familiar with because I wasn't there. But I think in terms of was it a success or not because it didn't build the next Instagram I think is a little bit of the wrong bar to set for things like that. To some extent, it's like, "Did the group win the lottery or not? And let's judge there. Let's judge their success." Obviously I'm not saying that discovering something like Instagram is just winning the lottery, but you get what I mean in terms of the rarity of those sorts of discoveries and those sorts of products.

(00:40:12):
I think that that team was very realistic about what I would say would be the champagne level outcomes and/or more like the kind of beer, nice dinner kind of level outcomes.

Lenny (00:40:28):
Your wine.

Noam Lovinsky (00:40:29):
Yeah, the wine. Yeah, thank you. That's a better analogy. I think we built knowing those sorts of outcomes would also be very beneficial to the organization. So as an example, one of them is, at Facebook scale, doing things that don't scale or doing things that start out small was just a muscle that was really hard to come by, right? It's like any community product that you build, any kind of social where there's community density that's important early on, any product that you build that way, starting with a million users is a really hard way to do that. At places like Facebook and Google, it's like it's hard to run an experiment with a hundred people. It's not hard, it's impossible, right? And so this idea that you would have to get real small, that you would have to start very targeted, that you would have to start with things that clearly don't scale and don't have a chance of being big from the get-go is really, really hard in an organization like that.

(00:41:47):
And so creating that space for NPE to be able to do that, to be able to help remind the organization what are the mechanisms we need to be able to build and learn that way was very beneficial. Even simple things. At an organization of Facebook size, maybe experiences at an Airbnb, it is really hard for product managers, engineers and designers to talk directly with customers. It is basically impossible. You're almost always talking through some third party, some recruiting agency and getting reports and you're not always in the room. Imagine building a startup, like a product from day one and not being able to sit right next to your customer and being like, "Show me how you do this or show me how you do that.' It's incredibly hard. You're looking for such faint signal.

(00:42:48):
The idea that you would try to get it through layers of indirection and games of telephone is crazy, but at that scale, that's what you have to do because there's all of these legal concerns and many other realistic concerns about what you can say to who and who you can talk to and what you can tell them about what you're doing and all of these things. So creating an environment where those sorts of constraints were lifted and were different was very beneficial, I think, to the organization and started to shed a light on some of the things that were broken that make it hard to build 0 to 1 in those sorts of environments.

(00:43:31):
I also think it was a really fantastic recruiting tool. It did build a really great group of folks, many of which have left to go start interesting companies. But I guess what I'm trying to say is I think when you're an organizational leader, and Schrep was the org leader that was supporting NP at the time and he's fantastic and really did a good job of firewalling that team, I think you're looking at a set of objectives and a number of ways that you might help the company and the organization. Even if you set that light on the hill to be like, "Go find the next Instagram," many of the things that you would do along the way to find the next Instagram end up being very beneficial to the broader organization. We saw a lot of that in PE.

Lenny (00:44:28):
That's a really interesting perspective. There's a lot of other goals with something like this, it's not just find the next massive business. It's the way I think what I'm getting from this is shine almost a mirror on the organization, like, "Here's the things we can't do with the regular business and we have to do something. We have to set this up in order to try something totally new and radical recruiting tool" I think is interesting.

(00:44:49):
There's actually a team at Airbnb, the way I described it was, I don't know how many people know about Burning Man and how it works, but there's this trash fence around the side that catches all the trash so it doesn't go into the desert. And I feel like there's teams sometimes that are the trash fence of the company.

Noam Lovinsky (00:45:04):
That's funny, yeah.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Where someone's about to leave and they're like, "No, go work on this coal stuff over here in the fringe," which is really interesting. But just instill within the company and maybe help with that. Just keep people that are awesome at Meta. [inaudible 00:45:16].

Noam Lovinsky (00:45:16):
Yeah. You're right that the team didn't discover the next Instagram. For what it's worth, things like Threads and ideas like Threads were in that team all of the time. I think that if that team caught the wave of generative AI and all of the opportunities and new technologies there, I think things could have also... Because those are certain moments where you having small, really motivated, dedicated teams that aren't thinking about anything mainline can lead to faster discoveries, I think that can also help. But there were a number of things that basically ended up becoming features in other products and they were just easier, faster ways of validating and building them because you didn't have the constraints of the mainline product development organization, right?

Lenny (00:46:07):
For someone that is thinking about trying to create a startup within a startup, something a lot of big companies are trying to do, is there a piece of advice or two that you'd share for helping this be effective? Maybe one is just the goal may not be build the next big business. There's these sub goals also. What comes to mind?

Noam Lovinsky (00:46:26):
God, there's so many. Schrep did a really fantastic job of removing a lot of these constraints. So one is I would say think really hard about the incentive system. Smart, good people, even if they're not trying to, they end up kind of gaming things towards the incentive system. And so think long and hard about that. So for instance, if you're a large organization and you do some performance management process like twice a year and that's how you're going to evaluate and incentivize people in your 0 to 1 incubator, you've already killed it. It's the wrong incentive, it's the wrong timeframe. It creates adverse selection, problems for the sort of people that you bring in. And so it's hard in an existing organization to say, "We're going to take all these company processes around even how we level people and pay them and motivate them. And we're going to throw them out the window for this group."

(00:47:27):
How you build the infrastructure you use, this is something that the NP team did really well. Everyone got to do their own thing from an infrastructure perspective. Just do what is best for the problem you're trying to solve in this moment, knowing that you're likely going to throw away a lot of this code anyway. Being able to do that in an organization like Facebook or Google, if you ask anyone that works on those things, is really hard. It takes someone like a Schrep to be like, "Nope, they're going to get to do this. Sorry." And so I think that's really helpful.

(00:48:01):
For what it's worth, one of the organizations that we talked to that I felt like was doing this in one of the best ways was Nike. Nike has this incubation lab. It's a completely different operating model. They recruit a completely different type of person, very different incentive system. And essentially, where they end up plugging them into Nike is that when they have something into the distribution marketing kind of growth arms of Nike. But for the product discovery process, they're doing their whole different thing. Once they find some fit, then kind of Nike comes in and goes, "Boom. I'm going to help you explode your fit." But I think that the number one thing I would think about would be the incentive system and the adverse selection that that can cause.

Lenny (00:48:52):
To me, the most important element of the incentive system, and maybe I'm reading between the lines, is you're basically competing against them starting their own thing. And having upside if things go super well feels really important versus, "I'm just going to get a cool salary at Meta and work on this thing." That doesn't lead to the same experience as a startup where everything's on the line.

Noam Lovinsky (00:49:10):
Yeah. And also what time horizons, right? When you're starting a company, you're not thinking like, "In the next six months, I'm going to get a promo and I'm going to get a good rating and things are going to go well." You're thinking on a different, excuse me, time horizon, and you're thinking about an outsized impact or an outsized incentive. And so I would think about that if you're starting things internally as well.

Lenny (00:49:34):
Awesome. Okay. Let's move to the final bucket, Grammarly, which is where you're at now. The way I'm thinking about it is this kind of like a one, two rocket ship or I don't know, 10. It's further along than one, but that's where you're at now. To me, Grammarly is interesting because it's one of the very few successful B2C subscription businesses. There's almost none. There's Duolingo, Grammarly. And I know you're doing B2B also, but there's so few. There's so many dead bodies trying to build a business on top of consumer subscription. And so I'm just curious. What the current state of Grammarly? How are things going? What do you think has been the key to it being successful all this time and continuing to grow? And what lessons have you learned? I know you just joined relatively recently, but anything you've taken away from that journey so far?

Noam Lovinsky (00:50:26):
We don't talk about it often, but Grammarly is a much bigger company from a revenue perspective than I think people realize. The company has been around for 15 years and was profitable from day one, and continues to be quite profitable. So it's a very, very healthy business that is much larger than folks might realize. And that is actually quite intentional because the company was trying not to be noticed for a long time, very intentionally. The fact that you would have grammar and spell checking in Google Docs or grammar and spell checking in Word. People would often write off the company that like, "How is that a business? How is that a feature? These products already have it." And that was very convenient for Grammarly because they could kind of navigate between these giants in tech and grow a very phenomenal business on this use case that people had written off.

(00:51:30):
Now, come the advent of LMS, it's no longer a use case that people are writing off and sort of the dream of the founders that machines can assist us in communication in this way that they've had for 15 years, I feel like now the whole industry is like, "Well, this is obviously how we're going to communicate and machines are going to do all these things for us." And Grammarly is now sort of in the center of that hurricane. And again, I think it's a similar thing where it's like, "Well, there's ChatGPT. There's Microsoft Copilot. How is Grammarly going to have a chats?" But yet things still seem like there's the future. The future is bright.

(00:52:14):
And so to your question, I think what has made it work, I've only been here for 10 months so please kind of take this with a grain of salt, but my instinct is that people really love Grammarly because of how it works and where it works. And what I mean by how it works is Grammarly is one of the few products where you just install it and it makes you better. You don't have to configure it, you don't have to manipulate it, you don't have to change anything about what you're doing. You carry on and across all of your applications, across all of your tabs, you'll start getting pushed assistance to you in the right moment. You could ignore it if you want, no big deal, but it takes a very, very small amount of effort to tap on one of those things, get some value and keep going.

(00:53:04):
I think that a product that is that easy to use, that easy to extract value from, but then also that prevalent, how many different text boxes do you write in a given day? I mean, it is not less than 10, it is tens or potentially hundreds, right? And so it is everywhere and it is very, very low effort to get real value from it. And then the where we work is what I said, you don't have to change anything about your workflow. Grammarly meets you where you are and you get value from it. Doing that really well at this level of quality for a user base of this scale, essentially it's like a huge AI achievement masquerading as a little UX innovation, right? But that experience, that UX that sort of brings AI to the masses has obviously served Grammarly really well. I think those are some of the strengths that we're going to continue to lean on to now provide a very different type of assistance and value that we can because of where the technology has moved.

Lenny (00:54:21):
The other thing I've heard a lot about Grammarly, and Yuri was on the podcast and who led growth for a long time at Grammarly, is just how scrappy the business has been and the founders have been from the beginning, the fact that they've been profitable from the beginning. That feels like one of the threads through all of the successful consumer subscription companies, is super scrappy, not raising money for a long time. Is there anything there that you found to be really interesting or helpful for other folks that are maybe building the space?

Noam Lovinsky (00:54:46):
When you're a team that kind of starts out of Ukraine and you're not thinking that there's any chance that you're going to raise money and why would you do that, I mean it really... Back to our previous conversation of what happens when growth goes negative, it really forces you to focus on the important things. And so, like many of the early engineers who are still here because the company has done so well over the years, they think in like, "How is this work going to translate into revenue?" They think about the impact on the business from even very deep technical work that they're doing because I think they were brought up in this culture where the business doesn't really invest ahead of its profitability because it was a bootstrap business from day one. So that enforces everyone to think about their projects and their prioritization and how is what they're doing over the next two months going to actually turn into more revenue and keep the company growing and sustaining. So I think that culture is prevalent and help Grammarly get to where it is.

(00:56:00):
Now, I just want to be really honest that in moments that we're in like today, that can also be detrimental because the business gets to a certain size, you start getting to law of large numbers. You need to start thinking about are there other products? Are there other use cases? Are there other channels of growth? How do you invest ahead of some of that growth and start to diversify? Because at the scale and size that we are and aspire to be, we're going to have to do many more things and service many more different types of customers. And as you mentioned, we're going to have to pull off the motion of B2C to B, kind of get that product-led sales motion going. So all of those things are happening. And thankfully the business is as strong as it is where we can invest ahead now in those things while still maintaining profitability and a really strong business.

Lenny (00:56:57):
That's amazing that they're still team members and maybe I think you said engineers from the beginning, 12 years later. I think that says a lot about the business. And before we started recording, they're based in Ukraine and you were saying that they're going to Zooms, there's bombs going off, they have to go into bomb shelters and then jump on a meeting. It's incredible that team continues to operate and the business continues to do this well in spite of all that.

Noam Lovinsky (00:57:22):
Yeah, the team in Ukraine at Grammarly is... I mean, it's something else. It's a really fantastic team. When you speak to many of them, I think actually the work provides sometimes a very useful distraction, but they obviously feel a lot of pride in the business. They built a lot of this business. There aren't yet many businesses of this size that kind of come from Ukraine. I think that that team is incredible and continues to deliver a ton of impact to the company even in the circumstances that they're in. I know for the founders, a lot of why they want Grammarly to succeed and be the generational company that it can be is for Ukraine, and especially in this moment and it's awesome to see how that motivates them and 15 years on the same project is not nothing. That's some serious resilience. And so I think even in moments like that, using them as a way to motivate and strive for something greater I think says a lot about the founders and the team in Ukraine.

Lenny (00:58:40):
Absolutely. Hopefully there's a happy resolution soon there. I don't know if you know this, I was actually born in Ukraine.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:47):
Oh wow.

Lenny (00:58:48):
I know Odessa.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:49):
Oh, nice.

Lenny (00:58:49):
I don't want to talk about that much, but it's true. And I just realized we both have skys in our last name. Lovinsky and Rachitsky.

Noam Lovinsky (00:58:56):
So for what it's worth, my dad was born in Ukraine. He is from Kiev. My mom was from Lithuania, so yeah, I also have some Ukrainian background here.

Lenny (00:59:05):
All right, so Ukrainian episode.

Noam Lovinsky (00:59:07):
Yes.

Lenny (00:59:08):
Let me zoom out a little bit and get to the final couple questions. So thinking about your career broadly, I'm just curious if there's any general advice you share with people to help them have a more successful career. Anything that just generally you find is really important to do well or mistakes they make. And this is a big broad question, but anything come to mind of like, "Here's something you should really try to do more of or less of?"

Noam Lovinsky (00:59:37):
Look, when you're thinking about career opportunities and what job to take, it's really, really hard to sniff out really well in a high degree of certainty like success. I think that having a good nose for people and the sort of people that you can be successful with is something that you can develop. What I found is I always try to prioritize putting myself in positions that are going to cause a lot of growth and learning. And growth and learning can be very painful. And you kind of got to be okay with that and go into that because on the other side of that pain I think is the promised land.

(01:00:21):
And that's just served me really well, is I can't necessarily predict with high degree of certainty that this thing's going to hit, but I can get a sense of the people around me and I certainly can find situations that are going to stretch me, that are going to force me to do things that I haven't done where I'm going to grow and learn significantly. And over sort of the arc of my career, I feel like that's served me well. So that's usually what I tell people, is focus on on that if you can.

Lenny (01:00:53):
I love that advice. I've used this quote a number of times on this podcast, but something I always come back to is this line, "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek." I'm curious if there's something you have found about when the pain is too much, that you shouldn't pursue that. A lot of people get into these places where their mental health gets hit, their physical health is hit, they're just doing work they should not, it's too much. Is there anything there that you find it's just like, "Okay, maybe this is too much of discomfort"?

Noam Lovinsky (01:01:24):
I mean, I think about a couple of things. I think in any situation you should be able to lean on one or two things that you're really strong at. That can be the foundation that keeps you going while you learn the other things. So just be wary of situations that are too net new.

(01:01:44):
There should be one or two important things as part of that job going into where you're like, "I got this. I know how to do this portion of it." So as an example, if you've never inherited a very large team and you work through how that works, but the product area that you're working on is one you're very familiar with what's necessary to be good in that product, whether it's really good sense of design or really good sense of analytical thinking, recommendation systems, what have you, there should be a couple of those things where you're like, "I got this. These things are going to be a stretch, but these things, I feel like I've got a handle on how to do this. I can always get better, but I feel like they're in my wheelhouse." And I think that tends to allow you to balance the pain with the areas that you already know and manage through in a more balanced and healthy way.

Lenny (01:02:48):
It reminds me of that chart I think from flow of you want it to be challenging but not too challenging, and that's where you end up being most successful. Is there anything else, Noam, you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:05):
Yeah, I just think that maybe going back to where we first started, Lenny, work on the things that make you happy, that fill you up. Life is short. We're all very lucky to be in this moment. There's no reason to spend time on things that don't give you energy. There's so much to do out there. I think that's the main thing I would focus on.

Lenny (01:03:29):
Amazing. And even though there will be things that you have to do, I think it's important to try to find as much of that as you can because not everyone can just like, "Nah, I'm not going to do this work thing. I'm just going to go on a walk." But I think that's such an important point. And we've talked about this actually a bunch on recent podcasts of just doing this energy audit where you pay attention to what gives you energy and what doesn't and try to do more and more [inaudible 01:03:54]-

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:53):
Totally.

Lenny (01:03:55):
... willing to do that again. With that, we reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Noam Lovinsky (01:03:59):
Yeah, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:04:00):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Noam Lovinsky (01:04:06):
I'm going to cheat on this one and I'm only going to give you one. I'm only going to give you one because I don't want to cloud with any other. I recommend Build by Tony Fidel. Other than it being a good book, one of the main reasons I recommend it is that my wife wrote it. So she wrote it together with Tony. And I got to see that experience. She's a fantastic writer and Tony has a lot to learn from, so I recommend that book. I think that the part of it that was particularly inspiring to me to hear even more of the details that are in the book is just how many times he met failure before he made discoveries that are now driving so many of the things that we do. It's just a good reminder to keep at it and do the thing that really gives you that energy because eventually you can make that incredible discovery.

Lenny (01:05:00):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Noam Lovinsky (01:05:06):
I really like For All Mankind, if you've seen that on Apple TV. And then I just finished the last season of Fargo. Every single season of that series I think is fantastic.

Lenny (01:05:19):
Amazing. For All Mankind though, last season, not as amazing a consensus that I agree with, but worth watching.

(01:05:26):
Next question. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Noam Lovinsky (01:05:32):
I generally like interview questions that allow us to kind of do some work together, so I'm a little bit less on the behavioral "tell me about a time when" sort of stuff and more on the "Let's work a product problem together." It could be anything from like, "Let's design an alarm clock for children." Or lately I've been using one. "Given where technology is at, if we were to rebuild email, how might we do that?" I just feel like getting into it and getting into the details and really watching each other exercise our craft I think is really important. I have a whole podcast one time, if you're ready, about how most people don't know how to do leadership recruiting. And I feel like as I've advanced in my career, the interviews for some reason get easier and actually I can evaluate less about who I am as a product leader and whatnot. But yeah, those are the sorts of interview questions that I typically like.

Lenny (01:06:30):
Amazing. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:36):
It's not recent, but I was a very early user of Arc and I really love Arc.

Lenny (01:06:43):
Your window right now is inside Arc. I also love Arc. We had Josh on the podcast.

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:48):
Nice.

Lenny (01:06:49):
Just watching the onboarding experience of Arc alone as a product person is worth your time.

Noam Lovinsky (01:06:53):
Totally. I love the animation when you download something. I mean just like all of the little things. And if Josh is listening, we would like to get Grammarly to work better with Arc, so please hit me up because I think there's a few things that the Arc browser is doing that make it hard to get Grammarly to work either on the client or in the browser.

Lenny (01:07:10):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends or family either in work or in life that you find useful?

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:18):
Gosh, for those that know me, this is going to share so much of my personality. I think the first thing that comes to mind is, we are meant to struggle. I just feel like through struggle is how we get better, how good things happen, how bonds form, and so I don't shy away from that kind of life experience.

Lenny (01:07:39):
I'm going to guess that you're Jewish. I'm also Jewish. That feels like a very Jewish thing to say. I love it.

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:43):
How would you guess, Lenny? It's literally written on my face. Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:48):
Perfect. Last question. As the chief product officer at Grammarly, I'm curious what word you most often misspell?

Noam Lovinsky (01:07:57):
The.

Lenny (01:08:00):
You do T-E-H?

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:01):
T-E-H. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny (01:08:04):
Oh, man. Well, I find I misspell every word.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:04):
Oh, that's funny.

Lenny (01:08:06):
I'm a terrible speller. I'm thankful for my... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:09):
I was about to say I have a product for you that can help with your spelling if you want.

Lenny (01:08:13):
I am an active Grammarly user. Not only that. I use every product you've worked on, I realize.

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:17):
Oh, nice.

Lenny (01:08:17):
Obviously, Meta and mostly Instagram of the Meta products. And obviously Grammarly now and YouTube. I have a YouTube channel. Check it out. Subscribe and follow. And Thumbtack. My wife is a big Thumbtack user. We found many pros on Thumbtack from all kinds of parts of the world.

(01:08:35):
Noam, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Noam Lovinsky (01:08:42):
Yeah. I'm pretty much @noaml everywhere online, so Twitter is probably the easiest. My DMs are open. And then how people can be useful to me is please use Grammarly, provide any feedback that you might have. And honestly, if I can be helpful in almost any way, feel free to reach out. I often will take those conversations and build those connections, and that is always very helpful for me as well.

Lenny (01:09:05):
No, thank you again so much for being here.

Noam Lovinsky (01:09:08):
Of course. Have a good one, Lenny.

Lenny (01:09:09):
Bye everyone.

Noam Lovinsky (01:09:10):
Bye.

# How to ask the right questions, project confidence, and win over skeptics | Paige Costello (Asana)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
You're often the youngest person in the room. What have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics?

Paige Costello (00:00:07):
The thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product.

Lenny (00:00:15):
I'm curious, what you find most holds back new PMs?

Paige Costello (00:00:19):
Your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. Effectively, there's this notion of, "How might the opposite be true?" The moment I challenged myself and said, "How might the opposite be true?" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine."

Lenny (00:00:45):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Paige Costello. Paige is a product lead at Asana overseeing teams responsible for the core product experience of Asana. Before Asana, she was Director of Product at Intercom, and prior to that, she was a group product manager at Intuit where she spent five and a half years. In our wide-ranging conversation, we dig into strategies for building trust with people who are more experienced than you or older than you, we talk about coaching product managers, including why leading by example is often the most effective strategy, we talk about Asana's product development process and how it's evolved over the years as the company has scaled, plus some of Paige's product and career missteps, and what she's learned from those moments. To prep for this interview, I got input from some of Paige's colleagues and former colleagues, and everyone I talked to loved Paige. You'll soon see why. Enjoy this episode with Paige Costello after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:47):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.

(00:02:29):
If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:04:05):
Paige, welcome to the podcast.

Paige Costello (00:04:07):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:08):
So you don't know this, and I've been telling you this, but I asked a bunch of people that you worked with and maybe currently work with for questions, suggestions of things to ask you. So this is going to be really fun.

Paige Costello (00:04:19):
Wonderful. Now, I want to know who you talked to, but we'll find out.

Lenny (00:04:23):
I'll tell you right now. Big thank you to Jackie Bavaro, Yasmin who's on your team, and Montgomery and Steve Morin who is currently at Asana.

Paige Costello (00:04:32):
Ooh, fun.

Lenny (00:04:33):
So thank you to all of those folks for giving me a bunch of great questions, suggestions.

Paige Costello (00:04:37):
Looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:04:38):
Maybe just to settle a context, can you just talk about... At Asana, what do you work with? What is your team? What do you work on, and what is your team responsible for broadly?

Paige Costello (00:04:45):
Yeah. Absolutely. So I lead the product organization that's responsible for our desktop, web, and mobile apps at Asana. The teams are composed of all the people in San Francisco and New York who are focused on creating clarity for individuals, teams, and organizations. Effectively, our goal is to help teams work together more efficiently and drive the outcomes they're going for. So you can think about the feature sets if you're an Asana user like goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, reporting, all of that. But really, we want to help people answer the question at work, "Who is doing what by when, and why?" So that notion of clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, progress, and responsibility are often so painful in people's work lives. When there is certainty there and clarity there, people can be much more efficient in getting the work done. So that's where my focus is every day. I'm a product leader for that group.

Lenny (00:05:44):
Cool. So, basically, like the core. When people think of Asana, it's all of that stuff is what it sounds like.

Paige Costello (00:05:49):
Yeah, yeah. There's another group that's focused on our process management, but a lot of the core work in project management, core is in my group, and then we have a growth and enterprise scale team.

Lenny (00:06:01):
You've been at Asana for about four years now, right?

Paige Costello (00:06:03):
Yes, four years this summer.

Lenny (00:06:04):
Cool. So something I'm always curious about companies that are at this scale is just the evolution they've gone through in terms of how they develop product, and so I'm curious, just in the time you've been there, how has the product development process at Asana changed, and maybe even simpler, what are some of the bigger changes that have been made to the way product is built at Asana over the years?

Paige Costello (00:06:26):
I would talk a little bit about how we set strategy and our planning process, and how that's changed in this time as well as how we actually ship product has changed in this time. On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams.

Lenny (00:07:23):
It might actually help if you even describe what is a pillar, what is an area in product development.

Paige Costello (00:07:27):
Yeah. Absolutely. So when I said I'm responsible for that core product pillar, that's one pillar, but then there's also the adoption and enterprise scale pillar and the workflow pillar. Within each of those, there are subgroups, and we call those areas. Each of those areas has a very specific target customer and problem space they're solving for. We've often also dialed up the clarity of the metric at that level. So while we have an R&D set of metrics, we have pillar metrics, we have area metrics, and then at the team level, there's often one or two that they're really driving forward. So you can think of it as a nested structure around our product strategy as well as how we measure success.

(00:08:14):
When I joined, we didn't have areas. We were organized around projects and around locations, and then we worked to make sure that the thinking was more durable and problem-focused so that our roadmaps were not about features, but were instead about what was most meaningful to tackle for our business growth. So that's a big thing that has changed is the altitude of planning and how that nests. Another thing that has changed is the time horizon. So, before, we planned annually primarily. Now, we plan every six months, but for a rolling 12 months. So we have higher confidence in the immediate half, lower confidence in the following half, but we just plan every 12 months, every six months because it gives our business more confidence in what's coming and a better opportunity to align our go-to-market and product planning.

Lenny (00:09:10):
Amazing. So I just actually was talking to one of the heads of product at Shopify, and they went through a similar transition where they used to plan yearly, and now they plan for the next six months. So it's interesting that I'm hearing this more and more, and you're saying that every six months, you revisit the plan for the next year. So it's an interesting hybrid of those two.

Paige Costello (00:09:30):
Yeah. Absolutely. I think the more you try to do things in a joined up way where you have a single target customer with sales and marketing, and you want to make sure that the impact of your releases hit their mark, the more it's important to reflect on it frequently and to be able to pivot quickly because our strategy, even when we think we have a two-year vision, something will change, and then we say, "Wow, we made so much faster progress on this than we thought, and we actually believe that there's a new opportunity or a new technology that we should be leveraging. Let's go bigger on that." So it reduces the feeling of churn and thrash. It makes us all more principled, and it helps us just make sure we're making the best use of our teams.

Lenny (00:10:20):
I like that it also admits you're not going to actually have a yearly plan, like everyone plans for year, and then halfway through, they're like, "No. Let's start rethinking everything again."

Paige Costello (00:10:30):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:10:30):
So I like that you're upfront about that.

Paige Costello (00:10:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:31):
Okay, and then within the plan, do you have quarterly plans and sprints? Is there anything more fine-grained with a detailed roadmap just while we're on the topic?

Paige Costello (00:10:38):
Yeah, not really. I mean, teams know approximately when are they expecting to do the work, but if you ask too much for a particular quarter, a particular week, or date, you will make strange choices about scope. So, really, we align on what success looks like, and the teams do their best job to ship as quickly as possibly, as iteratively as possibly, and we really encourage prototyping. So we added into our product process a notion that we might pivot or cut from stuff that we put on our roadmap because it felt like once it was on the roadmap, it had to be done, and that's just not smart.

Lenny (00:11:20):
Got it. So, essentially, there's a six-month roughly detailed plan of what each team is going to work on?

Paige Costello (00:11:25):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:11:25):
Got it. Interesting.

Paige Costello (00:11:26):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:26):
Maybe just a couple more things just to make them super concrete for folks that might be listening. What's an example of an area? What's an actual team that would be an area? Then, the other question I have just while I'm saying questions is, are there some metrics you could share of just what some of these teams might be gold on just as examples of how you think about metrics?

Paige Costello (00:11:45):
The area that came to mind when you asked about one of our areas is something called Coordinate, and their job is effectively making sure that the slice of Asana that helps teams work together is working effectively. So that's projects, and tasks, and the data that you might put into tasks, and all of the back and forth that is required when people use Asana for their core working team. Some of the metrics that they care about are like org paying weekly active users as well as really thinking about healthy project use. So we make sure that we understand what does good look like and what is a dynamic that we want to be creating in terms of people getting real value from using the product, and we build that into our metrics to have as a guardrail to ensure that we're not driving one metric at the expense of people really getting what they need out of Asana.

Lenny (00:12:41):
Just a couple more questions along these lines.

Paige Costello (00:12:44):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:12:44):
I'm nerd-sniped about process.

Paige Costello (00:12:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:12:46):
I think you use a process called the Double Diamond Process at Asana. Okay. Cool.

Paige Costello (00:12:49):
We do.

Lenny (00:12:50):
I've seen images of this in various places, but I don't know of any company that's actually using it as the process. Can you just describe what the Double Diamond Process is and how you use it?

Paige Costello (00:13:00):
So you might be familiar with lean startup concepts and Double Diamond as it relates to going broad, and then going narrow. So you go broad when you ask like, "What customer should I solve for?" and then you pick one, and then that's the narrowing. Then, you go broad, and you say, "What are the problems this customer has?" and you narrow, and you say, "This is the problem they have." Then, you go broad, and you say, "What solution should we do to this?" and then you go narrow, and you say, "This is the solution that we should start with." That process of going broad, and going narrow, and going broad, and going narrow forces people to get out of their opinion-driven lens because so often, we need to be curious quantitatively and qualitatively about what we're doing and why, and be more systematic and rigorous about getting there. It doesn't take long, but it just breaks the frame.

(00:13:56):
The Double Diamond Process that Asana effectively... Each of our typical reviews or artifacts sit at different inflection points on the Double Diamond. So we actually ask people to do a kickoff where they collect different information at different scale depending on the size of the problem and the ambiguity they're solving. Some people have already done enough customer selection and research that they're starting with, "What are the possible solutions to this problem?" and then they're bringing the spec, and that's the narrowing alongside design, et cetera. But it's really mapping our artifacts against this notion to make sure that the product thinking has that quality of decision-making. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:44):
The way you described it is it was very customer-target-oriented. Is that that the actual framework? Is it around who to build this for, and then what to build, or is it more... It is. Okay. You're not ahead?

Paige Costello (00:14:44):
It is. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:44):
Okay.

Paige Costello (00:14:56):
It's really important because then you also know what success looks like because if you pick your success metrics as using a feature, that's it. You're teaching to the test. It's not actually driving the outcome. So while our planning process is around effectively defining category and how we win, and making sure that customers receive certain benefits from using work management, the through line to the individual project that a team might be leading is they need to know who they're solving for and what it means to have that problem solved. So it always starts with enough customer insight such that we can creatively do what they're trying to do. I mean, really inventing on behalf of customers.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Can you maybe repeat if there's terms for each of those phases?

Paige Costello (00:15:49):
Yeah. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:15:49):
Then, is there an example of a feature or product that went through this that you could share? If nothing comes to mind, that's okay.

Paige Costello (00:15:55):
The inflection points are the kickoff, which is that going broad, and then customer and direction selection. So this is both the target as well as of the 10,000-foot views of how you might pursue solving this problem. Which path are you broadly going to take? Then, going broad within that path on different concepts, and then there's a design concept review. Then, the products spec. Then, the full experience review or design crit of the end-to-end experience and launch. So that launch review is often just, "Hey, here's the thing. Here's what we said. Here are the fast-follows." Most of the time, by that time, it's already been dogfooding internally for some time, and it's more of a formal, "Do we have the right metrics in place? Are we ready to ship?"

Lenny (00:16:52):
Awesome. Do these reviews happen in person, on Zoom, or asynchronous?

Paige Costello (00:16:56):
It depends. So it depends on the complexity of the work, and it depends how much we want to talk about it. A lot of our crits happen in person on the design side. A lot of spec reviews are more asynchronous, and then we'll say, "Depending on the number of questions people have, we call a meeting." Otherwise, we do mostly async, but it's a mix. It really depends on the complexity and ambiguity of the solution and how much people have questions about asynchronously beforehand.

Lenny (00:17:27):
I'm going to take a tangent with my questions here and talk about work from home policy at Asana. This is something that I've been wondering more and more about how it's changing because it feels like there's been a shift back to the office. So what is the current policy at Asana, and what's changed maybe over the past couple years?

Paige Costello (00:17:42):
Well, we were fully remote during the pandemic, and then we came back to the office in an office-centric hybrid format. So we're in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and then work from home mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. That dynamic has been designed from the start. We wanted to make sure that we took advantage of what's great about working together as teams, and so it's been the standard. So I would say what's unique about maybe Asana is we knew we would do that from the very beginning instead of hemming and hawing about would we be a remote workplace or not, and what would that mean, and how would we come together, and how would we budget for it. We're like, "No, this is going to be an office-centric hybrid," because we wanted to create spaces for people to work together and move quickly.

(00:18:37):
It's been interesting watching people get back into the swing of things. Even though we knew, it didn't mean that on day one, people were great at being in the office. People were taking standups sitting down. Whereas before, you would walk through our office, and you could hear people at standup because there were standup chants, and people would be out on the floor. Now, people are more likely to do their standup in a room, and we're trying the next level of standing up during a standup, but it's... I'm sure it's a shared experience for other people who are working in offices to get used to using the whiteboards again, to get used to standing up during your meetings. It's bizarre that we could lose a muscle that we had that was so innate so quickly, and I think even in the last month, I would say, and it's in June of 2023, there's more vibrancy in the office, more conversation, more casual... someone eating alone at the cafeteria, and someone sitting down next to them. So it didn't happen overnight.

Lenny (00:19:45):
I've been seeing a lot of tweets of founders just being like, "Work from home has failed. It's time to go back at the office." I'm curious if that ends up rolling into more and more companies, or if it's just a few founders here and there.

Paige Costello (00:19:56):
I think it's a real thing for mental health. I do think that having social casual relationships as well as more opportunities to talk strategy with people you're not forced into a meeting room with has been super beneficial. I can say that just today, I was having lunch and sat down with my head of data science, and we had an impromptu chat about how we review our experiments and how to evaluate whether we had ROI on learning, not just the metrics. It was one of those things where if we had to schedule it, it might not have happened, and if it did happen, it would have been a couple weeks from now.

Lenny (00:20:36):
It feels like just coming into the office once or twice... or sorry, being at home once or twice a week is not that different from how things used to be where there was a day of no meetings and a lot of people stayed from home. So it feels like it's almost reverting back to that.

Paige Costello (00:20:47):
Exactly, and people are better at it than they used to be.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Right.

Paige Costello (00:20:50):
So I would say our remote days are more impactful than the days we're together where we're getting into the swing of things.

Lenny (00:20:56):
Yeah. I feel like as a PM, the only day I was productive and getting real deep work done was the No-Meeting Wednesday. It was at Airbnb.

Paige Costello (00:21:04):
Yes. I would encourage you to know your chronotype and to lock that time where you have the most head space to do that work. So, for me, it's mornings.

Lenny (00:21:12):
Say more on chronotype. What is that?

Paige Costello (00:21:15):
I'm a morning person, and so I try to make sure that I don't have any meetings before 10:00, sometimes before 11:00, and that's when I do my hardest task for the day.

Lenny (00:21:26):
I also just thought about standups while I was at Airbnb and how not only how much energy they brought, but almost too much energy sometimes where there's like another team doing a standup, and they're just laughing and clapping, and we're just like, "Shh, we're trying to work over here." I feel like we need more of that again.

Paige Costello (00:21:42):
Totally. Yep, yep.

Lenny (00:21:45):
Okay. So, moving in a slightly different direction, something I heard about you is that you're often the youngest person in the room, and you often lead people with decades more experience than you. I want to ask, what have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics, especially when they're maybe more experienced or older, and especially in other functions, I don't know, execs or designers, engineers, what have you figured out there?

Paige Costello (00:22:13):
The thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product. If you can be the person in the room who has watched customers use the product and has a point of view about why one tool is significantly better or worse in a given dimension, and you can do that with confidence and clarity, and you don't need to know the other person's functional domain, and you don't need the expertise in what they're experts at, you can bring insight that makes people curious, and trust you, and just immediately believe that there's an opportunity that you're not advocating for that just is true. But I think that's a really tricky and unique thing is not to pretend like you have more experience than you do, but to be willing to ask great questions, and then be curious enough that you're bringing insight to every meeting that people may or may not have, but you're always willing to share.

Lenny (00:23:21):
That's such a good answer because it's like there's not a trick to it. It's just do the work, spend the time to become the person that has answers that people value and obviously, that will respect you, value your opinion, want to hear from you.

Paige Costello (00:23:34):
Yeah. Yeah. Our former board member, Anne Raimondi, and now our head of business wrote an article on First Round that was really great about the trust equation, and it really resonated with me. I don't know if you've heard about it, but she said that trust is equal to credibility plus reliability, plus authenticity, divided by or over perception of self-interest. I think when you're met by someone who doesn't know you, doesn't know your work, your job is to create credibility, and that's where I said bringing the insight is where you can really tip the scales here. Reliability, this is all about your say-do ratio. Authenticity is just being vulnerable, being yourself, and then making sure that people know that you're not in it for some other outcome or cause that perception of self-interest really can change whether people... how much they trust you.

Lenny (00:24:46):
In terms of knowing the insight and knowing thy customer, putting the time, I imagine, is a big element of that. Is that how you do that, or is there anything else along those lines that's just like, "Here's how I get really good at this?"

Paige Costello (00:24:59):
When you take a new role, become best friends with a researcher, and spend time watching customers use the product firsthand because what they maybe report on or are trying to do a study about might be very different from what you observe, but you really just need that front row seat with customers, and so asking, "How do I actually set up time with customers? How do I compensate them? How do I read the tickets?" Whatever. It's amazing how little you have to do to quickly catch up to understanding who the organization is solving for well and poorly, and how people really use your product versus how your teams use your product, especially in organizations where there are heavy dogfooding cultures. It's really risky to become less sensitive to the needs and behaviors of customers because people think they are their customer, and it also becomes very navel-gazey. So I think the more you get out and break up how people are having conversations about what we should do and why, and what we shouldn't do and why, and it's not about your opinion, it's about asking questions, and then bringing insight can really change the nature of the conversation and build trust.

Lenny (00:26:18):
I love that. In terms of confidence, you talked about the importance of communicating these things confidently. Is there anything you've learned about how to be more confident? The managing part of it is like having the answer, but is there anything there that you maybe coach your PMs around or other folks of just like, "Here's how you communicate confidence?"

Paige Costello (00:26:36):
It's a great question. I think being brave and courageous in little moments is just what you have to do. You have to show up, and say it before you're ready to say it, and ask for forgiveness, and be vulnerable. I think when you're vulnerable, people actually trust you more than if you come with all of this armor and say, "I know this, and this is how we're going to do it." So real confidence is often conveyed by being willing to ask the question or to say, "I don't know what you mean by that. Can you say that again?" It's also just how you communicate, looking people in the eye, your body position, your body language.

(00:27:22):
So much of this, I think people forget about because it's really easy to be in a meeting, and looking at your computer, and going through Slack messages. So one of the best things you can do is if you're in a meeting, be in that meeting. Continually scan the faces of everyone in the room, see if someone has a question, pause at the beginning, and welcome people, and chit-chat while people land, and then close asking questions like, "Did I get all of that? Is there anything you would've expected to cover that we missed?" It's really about being open, and that conveys confidence more than being assertive and advocating 100% of the time.

(00:29:04):
From my chats with folks that you work with, it's really clear that you put a lot of time and energy into mentoring and coaching PMs, and your team, and I think probably broadly at Asana. One thing specifically that came up is that you're very big on leading and teaching by example, not just, "Here's how you do this thing." So, if that's true, I'm curious where that came from for you and why you think that ends up being a lot more successful than like, "In a meeting, you should do X, Y, Z," versus doing it, and then letting them see.

Paige Costello (00:29:34):
I think the main thing is repetition. We're all students of repetition. If you see something done a few times, you're more likely to remember it and internalize it, and so it's also something that... a way that I learn, and so I think that's probably part of it. I remember hearing about a framework called the three Es: experience, exposure, and education. I think it was helpful for me to hear that as a way of growing your career or being more purposeful about your growth because I think when people are earlier in their careers, they tend to think, "Education, education, education," and then they started to think, "Experience, experience. How do I get the experience of being a manager? I need to read about it, and then be a manager." It's very linear.

(00:30:29):
Exposure was such an important one where I thought like, "Okay. So you're not in the driver's seat, but you're in the car, and you hear what's happening, and you're evaluating how this is... what the impact is." This goes back to being really present and analytical, and being a learner because if you can be a learner, not just in an education or experience context, but in an exposure context, you can really grow so much more quickly and in so many more directions than you will get from just what does your day entail from what work is directly required of you.

Lenny (00:31:12):
Is there an example of that happening either to you or you saw a manager leader do this, and you're like, "Oh, I get it now," or you doing that and it helped?

Paige Costello (00:31:18):
So I'll give two examples. I mean, the way I run my meetings are the kind of meetings I want to be a part of. So I try to make sure that I start with a clear agenda, and I move quickly, but give time for conversation and that it's not fully just sharing information, but debating where appropriate. I think knowing how to manage the conversation and courteously pausing people who are going on too long or taking the group in a different direction than was intended, and just think about the experience of everyone there, and create the experience that you hope that they're creating in the rooms that you're not a part of.

(00:32:08):
An example that I have in terms of experience is sometimes the experience is you doing the thing and getting that experience firsthand. Other times, you need an education, you need a mentor, you need a coach who will tell you what they're saying or give you advice. I was in a really high-stakes product review at Intuit, and at the end of it, everyone else had left, and the leader of the business unit as she was leaving the room said, "Always answer the question that they should have asked." "Always answer the question they should have asked."

(00:32:49):
I was pretty surprised by that advice because it was very profound in the moment because I think when you're a student and you are accustomed... If you're an achiever, you like to get As. You're probably going to hear a question and answer it. You're like, "One-to-one, one-to-one, one-to-one." But what I learned from that was that there's actually another altitude, another point of strategy when you're in a meeting or in a conversation to make sure that you're covering the more important point, the bigger picture, the alternative that the person asking the question maybe didn't see or consider. So I think the mix of experience, exposure, and education really helps you make sure that you're consciously moving forward on each of those fronts or finding people who can help you there.

Lenny (00:33:43):
I love that piece of advice, and it makes me want to ask, are there other pieces of advice that have been really impactful to you, or are there common pieces of advice you give to your team that just is a recurring theme of advice that maybe people even make fun of like, "Oh, Paige is always saying this?"

Paige Costello (00:33:59):
There are a few ways to think about advice, and my advice often meets some mark when it's for a particular person in a particular time in their career. So I would say advice I love giving to people who are early in their career is don't self-select because I think it's really easy to say, "I don't have the experience," or, "I'm not X, Y, Z enough," and not apply. So I really push people not to self-select, and I try to remind myself where that's appropriate to do the same thing. Other advice I often give is just think big, ship small. "Think big, ship small." What's the smallest thing you can do to do that thing? But let's not, because we're trying to ship all the time and in small chunks, start thinking in small ways because it's really easy to get a little too incremental, a little too wrapped around the axle around optimizing a metric and miss the bigger picture, and so think big ship small is another piece of product advice I give.

(00:35:02):
The last piece of advice that I would say that I like is more of a way of thinking. So this is a little abstract, but when employees join Asana, they get a book called The 15 Commitments of a Conscious Leader. It's led by the Conscious Leadership Group. They also get two-day training on some language and tools for how to effectively work with other people, and it's a really... For me at least, it was transformational because I learned some vocabulary and methods that I could share with my peers. One of the things that you learn is to be above or below the line, and something that is this concept of like, "Where are you? Are you above the line? Are you below the line?" If you're above the line, you're committed to learning. You're open and curious. Things are funny here, more playful. If you're below the line, you're committed to winning. You're committed to being right. Things are more black and white.

(00:36:10):
All of us have days where we're having a conversation and we're really in that below line space where it's like, "No, it just is this way. There's no two ways around it." That concept of understanding your personal head space, and then being mindful of how you're operating when you're in that place really was great advice for me and also recognizing where other people were when it related to decisions we were making or context. It also helped me think about rejecting false trade-offs and challenging like... Effectively, there's this notion of how might the opposite be true, and that's a piece of advice that I give myself like this morning.

(00:36:55):
I think it was yesterday, actually. I was like, "How am I going to do tomorrow? Tomorrow, I have to deliver the clarity pillar brief to the area leads and make sure they understand our stack ranked metrics, and they need to know exactly what our strategic priorities are and why, and they need nudges, and they need to be able to translate our voice of business and usability lists into those plans. I need to establish a perspective and make sure this is all written down and they really understand it, and I have a great conversation with them where I get open questions and they feel like they can really challenge my thinking. I also am having a podcast with Lenny in the afternoon. Ugh." Right?

(00:37:37):
At first, it was like, "This is just too much. I should try to move or cancel one of these." Then, I asked myself, "How might the opposite be true?" I was like, "I can do both." It was just enough to pop the balloon because sometimes your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. The moment I challenged myself and said, "How might the opposite be true?" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, "Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine. We'll have a great conversation. I'm ready to show up, and be curious, and really engage with you on the topics that you've found interesting, and we'll just do that. So, "How might the opposite be true?" has been a really helpful piece of advice or line of questioning that I use with myself to make sure that I'm not taking myself away.

Lenny (00:38:43):
Wow. What a fruitful question that ended up being. That was amazing. How does clarity pillars strategy go? Are people into it? Is it working?

Paige Costello (00:38:52):
Yeah. I'm pumped. It's a really interesting time to be a product leader, especially with all of the tech transform... Truly, the technological transformation on LLMs is astonishing, the pace of development, the ability of our teams to just ship quickly and ship really intelligent things. We're not in an operational "figure it out" land. We're not in a place where we're trying to decide how to do a better job and get it out to customers. We really have lots of interesting paths forward and are trying to make sure that we're on the cutting edge while really looking at like, "What does it mean to serve the companies and organizations that we want to serve with new ways of serving them?" So it was a really fun conversation, and I also had to be honest with people and say, "This is a 70% cut. 30% of this is missing or incorrect, and that's why I'm coming to you early." So I think it went really well, and it's the start of our 12-month rolling planning conversation.

Lenny (00:40:05):
Let me pull on this AI thread because it's clearly top of mind for a lot of people.

Paige Costello (00:40:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:09):
How do you think about splitting up investment in AI exploration within the product team? Are you like, "Hey, team. Everyone should be thinking about AI as part of their product," or is it there's a team where they're going to think about AI and LLM integrations and, "Everyone else, keep doing what you're doing?"

Paige Costello (00:40:24):
We've had an ML team for quite some time, making sure that we have test prioritization models and notification prioritization models, and are making our product less work for people to use. But when it came to the massive leap forward in LLMs recently, we staffed a team to really prototype quickly, and discover what was possible, and just apply hypotheses outside of the typical norms of how we work. So they went straight to prototyping instead of going through that Double Diamond I was explaining earlier. What that meant was that we were really quickly able to say, "Wow, this is just so much better than we imagined and would never have prioritized it because we thought it would take so much longer." Then, in other cases, "That sounded good in theory."

(00:41:18):
So skipping a lot of that to just really try it on for a size has been key, and then what we're doing is giving the teams with the most expertise in the customer problems. For example, status and progress reporting, the keys to that car and saying like, "Here's the starter. Here's the hypothesis. Here's how far we got with it. It's dogfooding. What do you want to do?" So we're able to nudge people without wasting time and build the skills locally within the teams that then move those experiences forward.

Lenny (00:41:50):
I want to come back to the coaching topic. I had a few questions there that I moved off of, but I feel like that's a rich area of exploration. You mentioned Intuit. You worked at Intuit. Intuit is famous for having a really good APM program and really good training for product managers. What did you take away from that experience that you bring with you to coaching or even I think there's an APM program at Asana, too?

Paige Costello (00:42:15):
Intuit had excellent training programs, the APM program and their manager training. So, on the PM front, the biggest thing that they taught was around customer centricity, and it really started with the founding of the company. For anyone who works at Intuit or has worked at Intuit, they know that there's this story about Scott Cook watching his wife balancing her checkbook at the kitchen table, and staring at it, and saying, "There's got to be a better way, a software." So it was very typical for the product training at Intuit to be all about like, "How do you actually watch customers using your product or just doing the things they do, collecting the artifacts, knowing the workarounds, and using that experience to build opportunities for surprise and insight that then you can capitalize and create products around?" They also are very specific about how they define durable advantage and think about, overall, the product process from a place of customer insight through to the market landscape. So the PM program there was absolutely super thoughtful, especially for taking someone who has never PMed into being a super skilled PM.

(00:43:37):
They also have a wonderful manager training program, and I think the biggest thing that I took away from their manager training was really on the feedback slide. So delivering feedback is something that I think everyone benefits from, but for managers, it's so much more critical because if you don't do it, and you don't say what you mean, and you don't do it in a way that it can be internalized and acted upon, you really don't set up your teammates, your teams for growth or success in their careers. So their program for helping you think about like, "Okay. I'm going to convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing. Impact, made me feel like you weren't listening to me or made me feel like your voice was more important than mine, or impact, blah, blah, blah."

(00:44:35):
It doesn't matter what the impact is because the way you've set it up is it's a subjective observation. It's not what the camera recorded, it's what you experienced. Therefore, it is true and valuable feedback, and it gets the conversation started such that you can then talk about next steps. That format and framing really helped me understand that delivering feedback isn't about being right or about getting the right information to the other person. It's about sharing the impact of different decisions that they're making. So, especially if you have to give feedback about, God forbid, what someone wears to the office, or how do you feel their work is, or how they're communicating or their body language, having an enough support where you can be really clear about what you're intending and the spirit behind that, but that it's formalized enough that people can really engage with it has been enormously helpful, and I still use it today.

Lenny (00:45:35):
It's interesting how some of the most impactful training is such soft skills.

Paige Costello (00:45:41):
So basic.

Lenny (00:45:43):
Basic. Yeah.

Paige Costello (00:45:43):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:45:44):
It's just how to give someone some feedback, but it's like, "Know how to prioritize, how to do a meeting, how to give a presentation."

Paige Costello (00:45:48):
No. Yeah.

Lenny (00:45:50):
It's like, "Here's how you give feedbacks."

Paige Costello (00:45:52):
Yep.

Lenny (00:45:53):
So you've worked with a lot of early product managers. I'm curious what you find most holds back new PMs and help them being successful in their career, and even on the flip side, what most helps new PMs be successful in terms of skills or behaviors, habits, things like that?

Paige Costello (00:46:11):
I would say this illusion that you have to be all-knowing and super confident sets you up to be in a place of advocacy instead of inquiry. So PMs who are newer in their careers or who are in a different space than they're accustomed to working really want to be pro really fast. What pro means is trying to cut that straight path, and that can reduce information and conversation that makes you smarter. So some of the challenges that some PMs face are feeling like they need to be the expert, they need to be the smartest person in the room, or God forbid, they think they're the smartest person in the room.

(00:46:56):
Then, what happens is they're really doing that customer, or product discovery, or spec in a little dark room. Then, they show up, and they say, "This is it. This is right. I know it's right, and let's do this as quickly as possible." Everyone else says, "Wait. What? I don't know. I have a question," or they don't, and they still have a question, which is even worse. So I would say something that really holds PMs back is not being collaborative from a place of true curiosity like performative collaboration where they're not in a room or want to do a review, but ultimately, they don't really want the questions or the feedback.

(00:47:40):
I think trying to make sure that you can be in a place of curiosity and openness because that will make your experience more successful is really important. Other people aren't always going to be right, but if you're present for it, you can ask clarifying questions. You can ask the question behind the question. You can hear the feedback, and then say, "Was that something that I must do, that I should do, or that I should consider?" You can actually develop a conversation that will move your relationship forward, and so I would say that's something that I think holds PMs back.

(00:48:17):
PMs tend to be so ambitious and career-centric. There are so many good things about that, but I would say don't let the sound of your wheels drive you crazy. If you're present in your job, and you actually have fun with it and solve the problems, people will come out of the woodwork, say, "You're great, and tell your boss you should be promoted." You don't need to ask for a promotion. Your outcomes should speak for themselves. Yes, you should have sponsors and people who advocate for you, but a lot of that just comes from that raw connection to the work and to your team.

Lenny (00:48:55):
Everyone I talked to about you is like, "Oh my god, I love Paige." I could see why, but I want to ask you a question. I imagine you've made some mistakes either with a product or your career. I'd love to hear a story of something that went wrong and what you learned from that experience. This might be the last question, depending where you take it.

Paige Costello (00:49:16):
I would say that all of the advice I've given so far is directly related to things I've learned the hard way. So, especially as an IC moving into a management role, you aren't supposed to have all the answers. You need to ask better questions. You need to be thoughtful about direction and agency. So I would say one of the missteps here is knowing how to give guidance or direction in a way that doesn't feel like micromanagement because what you're trying to do is to teach a repeatable pattern instead of giving a precise instruction that can be used once, and then disposed of.

(00:49:57):
So I think that's a pretty common manager path issue, but I think the faster you learn it, and observe it, and use techniques to manage it, the better. So, for example, I would go to my meetings with a stack of Post-Its, and I would write what I wish I was saying on Post-Its and see if someone else would say it first. Then, if by the end of the meeting, I had decided that I still had a Post-It or two that was worthwhile, I would say them. But you've got to police yourself because no one else will do it because no matter how accessible you think you are, other people know that you're the boss. They're not going to necessarily speak over you or challenge you directly.

(00:50:42):
Another challenge I had is I'm a very optimistic person, and I like to look on the bright side. I'm very positive, and I think depending on the culture you're working with or depending on your team, sometimes they need to hear what's really bad, and they need you to be really real, and they need you to tell them like it is. Something I realized was that I had an experience where I didn't realize that people didn't think I was being authentic because they thought something was bad, and I wasn't talking about it, but it wasn't because I didn't think it was bad or didn't see. It was just because my nature was to say, "Well, I'm not going to talk about bad things because we're doing the things we need to do." As long as the plan is good, I wasn't really highlighting all the problems I saw or really pushing on those head on with my team, and so they felt like they didn't know what I was seeing or if we were saying the same things. That was really an interesting experience. Yeah, there were just so many. Yeah.

Lenny (00:51:49):
With that second lesson, is there something you've changed in the way you lead and operate where you now found a way to communicate, "Here's wrong," in a way that's still maybe optimistic and productive?

Paige Costello (00:52:00):
I try to be more real with myself and others. I try to show up and say like, "Hey, this is incomplete." For example, even the thing I did this morning, the clarity brief. I said, "This is 70% finish. The 30% that I don't believe is there yet are these three things. I don't feel confident in this piece of it, and hopefully, we'll have more clarity by next week." So that's an example of just being as real with the small things as with the big things so that people can balance their perspective of you and your work, and the organization and the environment you're creating.

Lenny (00:52:40):
I'm curious how you think about your career going forward. How far out do you think where you want to be, and how do you plan out the future of Paige's career?

Paige Costello (00:52:50):
I try to be really intentional about staying as much as leaving a role. When I think about my career as a whole, I try to think about skills or experiences I want to have as opposed to roles, or companies, or specific problems. So something that I think about is... Effectively, I evaluate whether I'm in a healthy role and in a good setup by asking myself about my learning curve like, "Is the steepness of my learning curve doing me a favor here?" because sometimes you might love the organization, love the problem, and feel like you're just not learning, or learning fast enough, or being challenged.

(00:53:39):
That's something that I think is really important. So thinking about the learning curve, thinking about whether the environment is positively impacting your ability to grow your career and make an impact. So, environmentally, you might have not enough staffing or tooling, or have someone in the management team who is toxic, or have a peer who is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That stuff matters, and I think people don't talk about it or take it seriously enough that your environment should include people who are advocating for you, and it should just be a place where you feel you've got the right ingredients to set you up to do the good work.

(00:54:24):
Then, the third piece is really around just the problem, the problem your product is solving. Is it fun? Is it interesting? I often like to think about passions are made, not found because I think people... We do this with nine-year-olds. We say, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" They look cross-eyed, and they say, "An astronaut. Just getting a vet. I don't know." There's this moment of panic, and I would say that being comfortable, saying like, "Go try different things, and see if the problem is interesting to you and if the problem is fun or interesting to you." It doesn't mean it has to be sexy. It doesn't mean the company needs to have a brand name. It just has to be something that you're curious about so that you do a better job at your job. So I would say learning curve environment and problem are things that I use to assess like, "Am I still on the right path, or should I consider an alternative?" But when I think about my own career, I really think about skills and experiences as opposed to roles. So I would say that that's more my frame of reference because otherwise, I think I am living in the future and not enough trying to make the most out of the career I'm living right now.

Lenny (00:55:44):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Paige Costello (00:55:49):
Yeah. Let's do it.

Lenny (00:55:51):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Paige Costello (00:55:54):
My go-to book recommendation for other PMs is inspired by Marty Cagan. I think it's a classic. The other books that I have enjoyed and recommended lately are The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

Lenny (00:56:11):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Paige Costello (00:56:14):
Ooh, I'm very much enjoying The Diplomat right now, and then TV show or movie. Let's see. I just watched the Fire of Love documentary, which is about a couple who study volcanoes, and that was a great change of pace.

Lenny (00:56:32):
I saw the trailer for that. I think I got to watch that, and I finished The Diplomat. It's awesome. It ends really well.

Paige Costello (00:56:37):
I'm not done. Don't spoil it.

Lenny (00:56:39):
But it's just good. I'm just saying it's good. That's not spoiling.

Paige Costello (00:56:39):
Okay.

Lenny (00:56:45):
Okay. Next question. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Paige Costello (00:56:49):
The good news is I can tell you this and still keep asking it because the answer has always come up differently. So I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it? Yada, yada." Effectively, the question gets that, "When the product failed," When something about the team didn't work," just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work, and evaluating people's mindset, and the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation. I think it's a great question. Really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (00:57:34):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?

Paige Costello (00:57:37):
I've been playing a lot with Poe.com lately. Yeah, just an opportunity to learn more about LLM capabilities in a firsthand way. It's been fun to create little bots. I'm playing with making a page bot. I can't say that the page bot could have had this conversation yet, but maybe next year at this time, you can have a conversation with the other me.

Lenny (00:58:07):
That's what the page bot would say if this was the page bot talking right now.

Paige Costello (00:58:10):
I would say though that the advice, bits and bobs, I gave you earlier are absolutely things that I've been thinking about feeding, but I think the page bot would probably say, "Ship it."

Lenny (00:58:25):
Poe. It's the Quora founder's LLM chat bot?

Paige Costello (00:58:30):
Yeah, and so you can try the different models. So you can do four, and you play five, and Claude, and a few others. Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:38):
There's also a lennybot.com for folks that haven't seen this. Actually, there's a whole post on my newsletter of how it was built, and you get a lennybot.com. It is trained on all of my newsletter posts, and I think... not yet podcasts, but someday it will have podcasts.

Paige Costello (00:58:55):
Ooh.

Lenny (00:58:55):
By the way, someone listening to this, we're looking for someone to maintain this bot and evolve it. So if you're really into this stuff and have done this sort of thing, please DM me on Twitter. I'm looking for someone to take over lennybot.com, make it more... Moving on. Enough about me. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Paige Costello (00:59:18):
One of the biggest ones is just, once again, being real about how many reviews and approvals it takes for something to get done and who's actually responsible for reviewing and approving work. So we got really aggressive about, functionally, who is in charge and at what level for a given review, and pushed to say to actually have limits on the number of people per meeting, on the number of sub-task reviews for a given body of work. What this did is it created a lot more agency and pace within given working teams. So what we did was we said, "We actually don't care. We don't want a daisy chain of approvals. We just want one person with whom the buck can stop with them, and they can be responsible for how the work moves forward such that the knowledge is known and we could have connected the dots more effectively than we do or did." So that's the logic there, and it really changed the pace and quality of our work.

Lenny (01:00:25):
I love that. Is there any more you could share, a number? What is the maximum? Is there anything that other people maybe can take as a-

Paige Costello (01:00:31):
Yeah. So no more than three reviews on a given piece of work where people are blocking one approver. If a meeting has more than 10 people on it, we ask the person hosting the meeting to kick out the other people and write better decision notes.

Lenny (01:00:49):
The three reviews is three meetings looking at the product as it's coming together, basically?

Paige Costello (01:00:54):
The three reviews are three people who are assigned a task to look at something, but only one person is blocking whether it moves to the next stage.

Lenny (01:01:03):
Got it. Informed people? Stakeholders?

Paige Costello (01:01:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:06):
Decision-makers? Okay. Great. Final question. You work at Asana. What is your favorite Asana pro tip?

Paige Costello (01:01:12):
I use Asana to run all my meetings and assign pre-reads. So I use the multi-assign feature in subtasks all the time where I make a task with a due date that says, "Read this thing by this date," and then I assign it to a team or a set of individuals like that really quickly. Then, when I'm in the meeting, I take notes live in a task, and then highlight parts of those notes, and convert them into subtasks so that none of the action items get lost.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Wow. You need to make a video or blog post about this. Not only is it using Asana to build Asana, it's using Asana to run teams within Asana.

Paige Costello (01:01:46):
Yeah. It definitely does that, but-

Lenny (01:01:57):
Asana all the way down.

Paige Costello (01:01:58):
People know who's responsible for what they want.

Lenny (01:02:01):
Amazing. Paige, you are awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Paige Costello (01:02:10):
You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter, Paige Costello, and on Twitter, @paigenow. Listeners, well, I'd love to hear how you think AI is going to shape the future of software for knowledge workers, but in particular, if you and your team use Asana, I'd love to know where you'd like to see AI playing a bigger role to drive efficiency alignment for your team. So, as you know, we offer a ton of goal management, work management pieces that help teams and orgs do their work together, and I'd love to hear from you about where you see the opportunity.

Lenny (01:02:49):
Awesome. Paige, again, thank you so much for being here.

Paige Costello (01:02:53):
My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:02:55):

# Redefining success, money, and belonging | Paul Millerd (The Pathless Path)

## Transcript

Paul Millerd (00:00:00):
Take three hours during a workday. Has to be during a workday. Block off your schedule, sneak out. People can pull this off. Go for a walk without a destination or do something from your childhood that you used to do all the time. Did you use to play basketball? Did you use to paint? Did you use to play an instrument? And just pay attention. What is emerging? Do you feel bad for sneaking out of work? Where does that bad feeling come from? What does that mean about your definition of work and what work means to you?

(00:00:30):
A lot of people have never really thought about, why do you work? People say money. Okay, that's fine. But what else? Why? Are you trying to be a good person? Do you see a good person as somebody that works every day? Maybe. These are a lot of scripts people grow up with. You're really just creating this space to get in touch with, how do I actually feel about work? How do I get to know myself more? Are there things that I've lost touch with that really bring me alive?

Lenny (00:00:59):
Today my guest is Paul Millerd. Paul is the author of The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life. His book is getting a lot of traction within the tech community, because it explores a different way of living, essentially breaking free of the default path for your work and your life that we all basically start on. What Paul describes in his book is almost exactly the path I took to figure out this very weird and wonderful work that I do now with the newsletter and podcast. And because of that, I think this is an important conversation to have, because it may inspire you to explore a different path in your own life.

(00:01:33):
In our conversation, Paul explains what the pathless path is, how to go about exploring your own pathless path, how to address fears we all have around money, and prestige, and safety that keep us on the default path, plus tons of stories and examples, and very tactical advice for thinking about exploring a new direction in your own life. With that, I bring you Paul Millerd after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:58):
This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate. But most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages, and recreating content for other channels and applications. And their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.

(00:02:30):
Forward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Riot Games, Linear, and more use sanity to build content growth engines that scale, drive innovation, and accelerate customer acquisition. With Sanity, your team can dream bigger and move faster. 

(00:02:44):
As the most powerful headless CMS on the market, you can tailor editorial workflows to match your business. Reuse content seamlessly across any pager channel and bring your ideas to market without developer friction. Sanity makes life better for your whole team. It's fast for developers to build with, intuitive for content managers, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of your tech stack. Get started with Sanity's generous free plan.

This episode is brought to you by Maui Nui Venison, a mission-based food company bringing the healthiest red meat on the planet directly to your door. I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year, after hearing their ad on the Tim Ferriss podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient dense and protein dense red meat available. Their operation produces the only stress-free, 100% wild harvested red meat on the market, that is the only one of its kind in the world, actively managing Maui's invasive axis deer populations, helping to restore balance to vulnerable ecosystems, food systems, and communities in Hawaii. Also, it is seriously delicious, not at all gamey, and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew, and steaks, and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat. 

(00:04:07):
We also feel great about it as a protein from an ethical standpoint. I highly recommend trying their all natural venison jerky sticks for an optimal protein snack, as well as a wide variety of fresh cuts all available in their online butcher shop. There are limited memberships available, but you can sign up and get 20% off your first order at mauinuivenison.com/lenny. That's mauinuivenison.com/lenny.

(00:04:34):
Paul, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast. 

Paul Millerd (00:04:38):
Excited to be here Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:40):
I'm more excited to have you on. You published a book called The Pathless Path, which I have right here. Last I heard you've sold over 40,000 copies of this book, which I know puts it in the top 1% of books sold, possibly in the top 0.1% of books sold. It's an absurdly high number for books sold. People don't really know this. And especially for a self-published book, it's a huge success.

(00:05:02):
And I thought it would be good to start with a concept that you call the default path. What is the default path?

Paul Millerd (00:05:08):
Yeah, I think the default path is different for everyone and slightly different in every different culture. It's really the story in your head about what you should do. And most of us have some sort of script that we're living out. This is especially powerful when we're in our late teens and early twenties, right? We're trying to execute a script.

(00:05:31):
And it can be different in every country. In the US it's sort of like go to college, get good grades, get a good job, make a good salary, buy a house, get married, have a family, things like that. And when it comes to work, the default path is get a job and work continuously for all of adulthood.

(00:05:50):
And when you opt out of the default path, there aren't really offerings. People have a hard time even contemplating it. You'll trigger insecurities in other people by just existing outside the frame of the default path. And it's the default path in their head of their conception of how the world should work and does work, right?

(00:06:15):
So a lot of what I explore is what is life beyond the default path, and what are the stories we can use to one, at minimum, feel better about what we're doing? And two, what are the stories we can adopt to thrive?

Lenny (00:06:32):
I imagine many people listening to this are feeling like, "No way I'm on the default path. I'm doing so many interesting things. I'm doing what I want," but they probably still are on this default path. What are some signs that might tell you that you actually still are on this path, and there's such a new direction you could explore that you haven't explored?

Paul Millerd (00:06:50):
Yeah, I think there's nothing wrong with the default path. The difference I would make is, are you conscious about what you're actually doing? What are the costs of your game? What are the trade-offs? What are the implicit contracts are you creating with yourself? A lot of times when people quit their jobs, they forget to fire the manager in their head. They don't realize they can take the afternoon off to spend it with their kids. They've created this implicit contract that Monday through Friday, eight to 10 hours a week you have to work. And that may work for people, but are you actually opting into that, or are you just sort of accepting the default? 

Lenny (00:07:35):
I think it's a really important point. It's totally fine to stay on this default path. It's not for everyone to try something totally different. Can you talk a little bit about just how to think about the benefits of that and the trade-offs of, "Okay, this is great, I'm going to stay where I am"?

Paul Millerd (00:07:48):
It's interesting. I did not think my book would resonate with people that were firmly in the traditional work role. Full-time jobs, big companies, things like that. But I've had many people reach out that say, "Wow, this sort of loosened the tightness between my identity and my work reality, and loosened it up a little bit. And I'm able to play with it a little more." I had one friend, he said, "From your book, I made a list of the four priorities. Right now I'm getting three of them. And it's helped me become more aware that I'm actually getting these three things that I prioritize. I'm missing the fourth. I'm probably going to have to make a change two years from now. Maybe another role, because I do want to lean into that fourth thing." I think it's really just about remixing your path. My hot take is that we're all on a pathless path. You were at Airbnb. Airbnb, every two years were there was a different company.

Lenny (00:08:53):
Absolutely true.

Paul Millerd (00:08:54):
Right? And so we're constantly needing to reinvent and reevaluate. And I think thinking of our lives as this smooth trajectory up this corporate ascent sort of limits the possibilities of our own life. So just acknowledging that we are being disrupted. We all have personal lives where we have relationship challenges, health challenges, external shocks, inflation, things like this, that are changing our reality all the time.

(00:09:25):
And it sort of sucks that there aren't these comfortable middle class jobs that are growing and abundant. They're shrinking. David Autor, a economist from MIT, has pretty good research on this, and it's just making people a little more unsettled. It sucks, but this is the reality we're living in, especially places like the US becoming super tech heavy. And how do you navigate that? It's hard. Everyone's struggling with their relationship to work.

Lenny (00:09:58):
Let's actually talk about the pathless path. You've been kind of touching on various ways of thinking about it. What's the simplest way of thinking about this concept of the pathless path?

Paul Millerd (00:10:07):
I really shied away from trying to define it super clearly. I think I have this passage at the beginning of the book that it's like the pathless path is basically a shift away from the default. It's a shift away from not knowing what you're doing as a problem to be solved toward an embrace of uncomfort, discomfort, and uncertainty. 

(00:10:32):
And it's sort of a personal journey of shifting away from operating around scarcity towards operating from a sense of abundance, having faith that things might be okay. And on a path like yours, this is a necessary condition. You have no idea what comes next, because nobody has been on the Lenny path before. 

Lenny (00:10:57):
True. 

Paul Millerd (00:10:59):
Right? And a lot of us are in this situation. Now if you're an accountant at an accounting firm in your early twenties, maybe there is a track, and you can sort of plan it, and it's pretty legible. But even still, I would argue that developing a relationship with uncertainty, not knowing what's happening, experimenting a little more, it's all of these things in one. And it's sort of my attempt to come up with a better narrative around work.

(00:11:27):
And it's been pretty cool, because a lot of people are embracing this and now using the term like, "I'm on my pathless path." And it allows people to sort of name it and gives them comfort. 

(00:11:40):
I've had people email me that have been on a path for seven years, and they're like, "This is the first time I actually felt okay about my path," because a lot of what my book is, is an exploration of, why does it feel so weird to do your own thing? Why does it actually feel shameful to leave a full-time job? Which is an aberration in the history of the world.

Lenny (00:12:06):
I imagine a big question everyone's mind right now is, "This sounds amazing. I would love to just do the work I love and break out of this path. How do I do that?" And I want to talk about that. But before we do that, what are some examples of pathless paths people have ended up doing? Something just to make it a little more real of, here's what people have ended up doing with their life. 

Paul Millerd (00:12:29):
So I think it ranges from a short sabbatical. And to someone like you or me who are sort of on this path and committed to this creator path, and things like that, there's a huge component of their creator economy. Not the creator economy from a VC perspective of all these startups that are going to save creators, but creators that are actually betting on themselves, finding some deeper satisfaction, a better relationship with work and committing to it. But it also encompasses people that are independent freelancers, that have a stable path, more predictable income than creator economy stuff. And it also includes people that are jumping from job to job.

(00:13:16):
I also have examples of people that are older. I talk to a lot of people in their fifties. They've solved their financial problems, but they've lost that sense of aliveness. And they're looking to re-inject that, and they need maps of how to approach that, how to think about that, what are the models, things like that. 

(00:13:37):
So yeah, it's a pretty big umbrella. It's a nice way to claim everyone's path, but I think the shared ethic is really a sense of possibility, and opportunity, and optimism. 

Lenny (00:13:54):
So just to kind of list out some of these end, and I think what's interesting is there's no end to this. It's an endless path to continue discovering. There's actually this quote that I wrote down here that I'll read that I think is a really nice way of thinking about this pathless path. "The goal is not to find a job, make money, build a business, or achieve any other metric. It's to actively and consciously search for the work that you want to keep doing."

Paul Millerd (00:14:15):
The big shift there, the big shift for me actually, when I left my job, I wanted to run away. I wanted to escape work. I wanted to not work. And I more or less accomplished that. I basically lowered my cost of living in Asia to about 1,000 per month. 

(00:14:34):
But then I started developing this relationship with writing, and creating, and all these things I actually really enjoyed. And I wasn't doing them to be famous or grow a following. I just really liked them and I liked doing it in public, because I was meeting others that were engaging on these ideas. 

(00:14:52):
So the big aha for me was, "Oh, you can design around liking work." The hidden assumption I had around work for the first 32, 33 years of my life was work sucks. You have to figure out how to tolerate it.

(00:15:13):
And within that frame, try to do your best to enjoy some of it. But ultimately, it's a trade-off of your time. You have to suffer through it. A lot of it is going to suck, and you have to put up with that.

(00:15:26):
Now, I think I'm very protective of what I do and don't do. This is why it was very easy for me to say no to Penguin. I didn't want to write a second book for them. I want to write a second book the way I did, which was super fun process. Writing a book was one of the most fun things I've ever done in my life. And so I sort of think about protecting them. 

(00:15:48):
And a lot of people are looking for meaning through work in a job shaped container. And I think that's just really hard to find. You can find it for short bursts, but maybe after seven or 10 years, it's just not doing it anymore. 

Lenny (00:16:05):
So let's talk about how to go about finding your pathless path and create the space and opportunity to do this. Because again, a lot of people listening are like, "I have bills to pay. I got kids to take care of. I got a home, I got a mortgage. I can't just go on a sabbatical, explore, travel, and find here I'm going to start a newsletter." So what have you found are ways to enable this exploration without risking everything? 

Paul Millerd (00:16:31):
A three month sabbatical is much more attainable than people think. Companies are desperate to keep people and are much more open to things like this these days. And the way I frame it is if you're assuming you're going to work continuously in adulthood, that's about 500 months. Try to find three months of that where you can create space and reconnect with yourself, explore things, just see what emerges, see how you feel. I think this is so vital for people in their thirties or forties who've worked for 10 years just to reconnect with themselves. 

(00:17:11):
And three months in a total of 500 months, people accomplish much more impressive things than that, like saving for their dream home. That is such a powerful thing people aim for that they make it happen. Even people that don't have a ton are able to make that happen, because it is such an important priority. And for me, I think creating this space was more important than owning a house, getting married. It was the most important thing for me.

(00:17:42):
And I actually quoted your piece. I pulled up the quote. It said, "Lenny Rachitsky took a sabbatical after a long career in product management, thought he would return to work. But by the end of the break, it was crystal clear to me that I was ready to move on to a new adventure." And then you said several weeks into your sabbatical, you stopped checking your email. "My heart was no longer in the work. I didn't yet know what I wanted to do next, but I knew it was time to shake things up." And you probably weren't in that state when you were still at Airbnb. 

Lenny (00:18:16):
That's right. I was super into the work. And I think the way I thought about it is the Kool-Aid kind of exited my bloodstream, and taking that time off kind of created separation. And then I started thinking, "Man, is this really what I want to be doing?" And that visceral feeling of getting excited about the work disappeared, which was crazy and scary. 

Paul Millerd (00:18:35):
Yeah. And so you have smart listeners, and smart people are great at excuses. So they'll say, "I can't do it because of this." I always think these things are much more possible if they really are the main priority. 

(00:18:48):
So what I tell people is fine, don't take a sabbatical. Take an afternoon. Take three hours during a workday. Has to be during a workday. Block off your schedule, sneak out. People can pull this off. Go for a walk without a destination, or do something from your childhood that you used to do all the time. Did you use to play basketball? Did you use to paint? Did you use to play an instrument? Do one of those two things, even better if you do both.

(00:19:19):
And just pay attention. It's a sort of form of work mindfulness. What is emerging? Do you feel bad for sneaking out of work? Where does that bad feeling come from? What does that mean about your definition of work and what work means to you?

(00:19:38):
A lot of people have never really thought about, why do you work? People say money. Okay, that's fine. But what else? Why do you work? Are you trying to be a good person? Do you see a good person as somebody that works every day? Maybe. These are a lot of scripts people grow up with. Or people that don't have a full-time job, are they bad people? 

(00:20:04):
And so you're really just creating this space to get in touch with, how do I actually feel about work? How do I get to know myself more? Are there things that I've lost touch with that really bring me alive?

Lenny (00:20:19):
It's interesting how much of what you described, we didn't know each other before we met for this podcast episode, but so much of what you say is exactly what happened in my path. I took three months off exactly. I took a sabbatical. I started poking around, exploring, doing a little writing. And basically led to what I do now, which is a crazy thing I never imagined in my wildest dreams. And so clearly this works.

Paul Millerd (00:20:43):
Yeah, and I think people will say, "You can do that because you worked at Airbnb," or, "Oh, you can do that because you"... I've talked to hundreds of people. So what I did before the pandemic for years was I opened up my calendar every Wednesday and I said, anyone that wants to talk to me about work can talk to me about work.

(00:21:02):
So at this point, I've probably talked to 500 plus people about their relationship to work. And the reason that's not surprising about what happened to you is it happens to almost everyone. The sabbatical almost has a 99.9% approval rating. 

(00:21:22):
I talked to one person. She was like, "I took a sabbatical, I stayed at home. My husband was still working for two months. I couldn't wait to go back to work." I was like, "Cool. You're the first person I met that didn't get anything out of a sabbatical."

Lenny (00:21:37):
That's hilarious. I haven't met that person. So your advice is try to take a sabbatical, and you're also encouraging people to, you can actually probably do this at some point, but maybe it takes a bit of time to set people up for the fact that you're going to do this. Maybe you need to work at the company for a while, but in your thirties or forties, it sounds like try to find time to take three months. And is three months important? Is that what you find, that large of a block of time?

Paul Millerd (00:22:03):
I've found it takes six to eight weeks just to unwind.

Lenny (00:22:09):
Yeah, that's exactly what I found.

Paul Millerd (00:22:11):
I think for me, there was the initial unwinding after six to eight weeks, and then a deeper unwinding after probably two to three years, where you start to trust yourself a little more, if you stay on the uncertain path that is. But yeah.

Lenny (00:22:28):
If founders are listening to this and feeling like, "Shit, why would I give people sabbaticals? They're going to leave, start their own companies, find some other catalyst path. I want them on my default path." Is there anything you could say to a founder thinking about offering sabbatical?

Paul Millerd (00:22:43):
I would say if that's their reaction, it sounds like they have an insecurity around work. So I would interrogate that first. What is the implicit story they have about how much people are supposed to work and such?

(00:23:00):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a good employer strategy. I think a decent amount of people would leave. I know Intel, I have friends that have done the sabbatical at Intel. You get six weeks after seven years. Maybe after seven years, they're a bit burnt out that they don't have enough time in those six weeks to unwind. 

(00:23:22):
But I think getting creative, especially now that remote work is so much more common about these opportunities, to let people become the people they want to be. People leave companies because they don't see a path to be the person they want to be. 

Lenny (00:23:40):
Okay, so you take a sabbatical, or you take an afternoon, or you take a walk. You talked about be mindful for what comes up. What are you feeling about work? What is a thing you want to do? Do you want to go play basketball? Do you want to go draw? What else do you encourage people to do, to try to discover a potential new path?

Paul Millerd (00:24:00):
I think meeting others. So in exercise, I'll have people do if they're curious about this... And for the most part, I don't want to convert people that like what they're doing and like traditional jobs. But a lot of people are curious, and I say have a path expert conversation. Reach out to somebody, sort of like a podcast, that's ahead of you on a similar path, and just send them a message and say, really thoughtful message. Say, "Hey, you're on a path a few years ahead of me. I'm really curious about this. I don't have people in my life that have done things like this. Can I just pick your brain? If we can't jump on a call, can I send you a list of questions?"

(00:24:42):
Most people will agree to that, especially the latter if they're a writer, because writing just enables them to come up with new ideas. So I'll always agree to do the written questions. I don't do the open calendar anymore now that I have a daughter. She wins my time over random stranger's booking. But if people want to send me questions, I'll always answer them in text form.

Lenny (00:25:07):
And again, this path doesn't have to lead to creator, artist, writer person. It could lead to starting a new business. It could probably lead to a new career. It could shift in careers. Is there anything else, again, of just where this could lead to people so they're like, "Oh, wow, that's interesting."

Paul Millerd (00:25:23):
Somebody sent me an article today about this guy. I think he was a performing artist. He became a therapist. I forget his name. But I think just the possibilities for reinventing yourself and taking different paths, working online, working flexibly, it's way more possible than 25 years ago. It's also going to continue to be more possible. All the tools and technology to enable these kinds of lives are just getting better and easier. And especially this week, ChatGPT just released their new GPT. I was playing with that today and I'm like, "Oh my gosh."

Lenny (00:26:04):
This episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client, and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life?

(00:27:08):
I think when people might hear some of these professions like, "Maybe I'll become a therapist, maybe I'll become an online writer person. Maybe I'll start a business." It may feel like that assumes you'll make less money doing these things. But in my case, and I'm curious if it's in your case, I make significantly more doing what I do now. I try not to talk about the income of this stuff, but it's significantly more than I made at Airbnb as a very senior product leader. And I feel like that often happens. You discover a way to do something you love and also make a lot more money.

Paul Millerd (00:27:39):
I think it's easier to make money in a sustainable, long-term way doing stuff you actually like doing. That sounds so simple, but it actually would've been really hard for me to stay on my previous path. 

(00:27:53):
Now, in my case, it was not until my fifth year that I came close to the salary I left. For the first three years, I really optimized for exploration, creativity, just getting to know myself again. I made 50 grand the first year, because I was freelancing. Then I made 30 grand, 24 grand, and then 30 grand. So I was really optimizing for getting to know myself. I dramatically lowered my cost of living, and that is one path. 

(00:28:26):
But this year, I'll make more than I ever made. And that is mind-blowing to me, because every single day of this year has been absolutely delightful. I've spent abundant time with my wife and my daughter. And it's so crazy.

(00:28:44):
Now, if I had stayed in my previous path, I'd be making a lot more than I make now. But that path was not viable for me for becoming... I'd be so frustrated right now if I had to go back to work. An eight-month-old, I know you have a four-month-old. Wait till eight months old. They're so fun to hang out with.

Lenny (00:29:12):
I can't wait. You talked about this lower spend, lower expense life. What other tips and tricks do you have for people to create this space where they can continue living and paying the rent, while exploring, and wandering, and exploring these things? Is it cut down on expenses? Is there anything else that one can do? 

Paul Millerd (00:29:33):
I've talked to so many people at this point. I've seen all sorts of things. I've seen people move abroad. I've seen families with kids and a mortgage sell their house and decide to live in an RV. I've seen people dip into their retirement. I've seen people apply for grants and get those. I've seen people apply for loans.

(00:29:55):
A big move that a lot of people do is turn their current job into a contract job, which a lot of employers are a lot more open than people would think. Because a contractor's very easy to fire. You can fire a contractor in a day. So if the company's struggling, boom, you're gone, right? 

(00:30:14):
And so there is more risk, but if you're known in the company, it can actually be a somewhat stable path to create more space in your life. You say, "Hey, I want to work three days a week. I want to be a contractor. Here's exactly what I want to do. Are you open to this?"

(00:30:30):
And as soon as you're a contractor, they can't tell you where to work. You can develop a relationship and they can ask you to work in a certain place, but they don't have control over where you work. 

Lenny (00:30:42):
A trick that I found really useful actually for helping me feel comfortable about taking time off, I ended up taking six months off, and then it ended up being a year off because I kept trying to figure out what is the thing I wanted to do. The way that I felt good about that is I set a budget of, "Here's the runway that I'm going to give myself. Here's how much it's going to cost to do this for six months. Here's the runway I'm going to give myself. I'm just going to burn through this money, just with the bet that it'll lead to something interesting." And that made me and my wife also just feel like, okay, we were going to lose all that money probably, but the bet is it's going to lead to something really great.

Paul Millerd (00:31:15):
Yeah, I love this. I think this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I've actually been trying to write something around this, which is that naming what you're spending money on or coming up with agreements like that, you're sort of saying, "This is money I'm investing in my life MBA." Because if somebody says, "I'm going to Stanford Business School," generally you'll receive positive praise. "Oh, that's awesome." But what they're really doing is not working for two years and spending 150 to $200,000, and not earning a salary.

(00:31:55):
And then to me, it was really interesting to look back at my path. Now, the first three years of my path, I broke even. But compared to being in business school, people thought business school was way better of a path for me. People were judgmental in my path, critical of my path, insulted me, projected their insecurities on me. "How could you do this? This is so crazy. What's your plan?" So coming up with these reframes is super powerful. 

(00:32:26):
One powerful one that worked for me was consider it a gift from your former self. So on the consulting path, I did like it for a while, but at the end I didn't like it. I was sort of just grinding through, going through the motions. I was good at it, but I really didn't want to be doing it if I had choice. And so I earned a decent income doing it. So would I gift that to my future self to be happier? Yeah. So now that I'm in the present, receive that gift and be like, "Thank you former self for working that job."

Lenny (00:33:08):
It's interesting. I could also flip it from the other way of your future self is returning to, "Hey, here's some money to spend to help become who I've become."

Paul Millerd (00:33:17):
Yeah, exactly. 

Lenny (00:33:19):
So I imagine not everyone ends up on a beautiful, amazing new life. They go down this route, they spend a bunch of money, and then they're like, "God damn, I don't have anything to show for it. I've spent all this cash." Imagine there are stories of that. Is there anything you could share around those stories and how to maybe either avoid them or be okay with them? 

Paul Millerd (00:33:38):
I think there are surprisingly few stories of that. I think that is people's fear of what might happen. What I've seen in reality, as soon as people are without an income or without a job, they spur into action. People, we're far more creative than we give ourselves credit for. Having a child, we have no idea what we're doing when they come out.

(00:34:03):
But it makes perfect sense that you're going to figure everything out, because you have to. You have no choice. And so the ingenuity and creativity of people as soon as they bet on themselves and go off into the wilderness, is far more than people expect. 

(00:34:24):
And it also has to do with regrets. People do not regret the things they do. They regret the things they didn't do. And the reason for this is if you've made a mistake, you can actually take action to correct it. But if you didn't do the thing that you're regretting, there's nothing you can do except do the thing. 

Lenny (00:34:46):
And it reminds me of a quote that you have in your book that I have here. The secret to doing good research, and I think it's related to this of finding a new path, a pathless path, is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.

Paul Millerd (00:35:00):
Yeah. And I wonder if you've found this too. Sometimes, the best way for me to write is to go for a walk, or to take a couple days off and just sort of reset. Creative work can't be forced a lot of time.

(00:35:20):
And increasingly, a lot of work is creative work. Your work at Airbnb was ultimately creative work. You're creating new products and offerings, in a whole new conception of an industry. You're making stuff up. A lot of times, I think people get fried in these companies because they're not actually given the schedules and the support systems around what actually enables creativity. 

Lenny (00:35:53):
Yeah, absolutely. Although I find with writing also, there's the benefit of the opposite of, "I'm just going to sit here and write, and I'm not going to give myself a chance to go walk around. I'm just going to keep writing, even if it's terrible, because it'll maybe lead to something."

Paul Millerd (00:36:07):
Yeah. And even that though, a lot of times, what ends up on the page surprises you. Right? So you do need a certain sense of openness to let that emerge.

Lenny (00:36:20):
So kind of along the same lines, another important concept that you talk about in your book for finding this pathless path is just this idea that it's not ever like this all or nothing. I'm just going to leap into this new thing. It's kind of this, the way you put it is people quit jobs after years of awakening and safely testing changes, kind of eliminating risks along the way. 

Paul Millerd (00:36:40):
So years before I left, and I'm curious if you had a similar experience, I was starting to read personal development books. I was reading Tim Ferriss. I was doing these small experiments like coaching on the side, helping people with their resumes, volunteering, helping people with careers. 

(00:37:00):
And so I was writing too. I was writing for fun on Quora with no goals. And all these things make perfect sense now. And even looking back further, I was always tinkering on the internet, and all these things fit my story perfectly now.

(00:37:16):
But I didn't know why I was doing them at the time. But each one gave me the confidence to be like, "Okay, I don't love my day job, but all these random things I'm doing on the side, like writing an article and posting it on Medium and LinkedIn, and the people I'm meeting, this is really interesting and energizing. I'm going to pay attention to that energy. Something is there."

(00:37:41):
And when I quit my job, I didn't really have a plan for how to deal with that, but I had experienced enough of this positive energy. I was like, "I want to chase that. I want to go after that."

Lenny (00:37:53):
That's exactly what I found. So I'll tell my story briefly on this. Some advice I got when I went on my sabbatical that ended up being incredibly powerful is essentially what you just said, which is when you're doing stuff during some period of time off, pay really close attention to what gives you energy after you do the thing. Say you have a call. Did that give you energy or did that sap you of energy? Do you feel more energized or you feel like, "I'm tired now"?

(00:38:19):
So it's like after calls you make, after things you do with friends, after some kind of hobby you're trying to do, after you write some stuff, just pay really close attention to what energizes you, what saps you energy. And then my whole strategy was just do more of the things that energize me and do less of the things that de-energize me. 

(00:38:37):
So in my case, I thought I'd want to do some advising or consulting. I found after every advising call, I was de-energized. I was just like, "No, I do not enjoy this as much as I thought." But after writing and putting a piece out, I was like, "Wow, this is really cool." Even though writing's very hard and there's a lot of de-energized moments, broadly it's like, "Wow, this is cool. People seem to really value this." So I started doing that more. I thought I wanted to start a company, but that kept sucking me of energy as I was working on ideas. So that alone was really, really powerful. And it sounds like really simple advice, but it's really [inaudible 00:39:10].

Paul Millerd (00:39:10):
It's hard too. I think the pull to create a company when you leave a big tech company is so powerful. And what you're saying is sort of crazy. You're saying, "I just feel good writing. I'm going to follow that." 

Lenny (00:39:29):
It's not a popular path amongst my friends and family. 

Paul Millerd (00:39:32):
And I think the root of that is you're triggering insecurities in them. You're doing something they weren't allowed to do at your age. 

Lenny (00:39:41):
The thing I found really helpful there, another friend gave me this advice, just tell people you're tinkering. When they ask you, "What are you working on?" "I'm just tinkering. I'm tinkering with some writing." Because something about that word makes it sound like, "Okay, cool, it's delightful and cool. Tinker wave." 

Paul Millerd (00:39:57):
I feel like that did not work with my parents. But yeah, trying different things. I always tell people you need a boomer compatible story for what you're up to, as just give them something. Just say, "I'm an entrepreneur," or, "I'm a business owner."

Lenny (00:40:18):
That totally resonates. I'd be excited about that if I was a boomer. In the book, you also talk about taming fears. So we talked about a few of these things, and just the power of taming some of these fears that you have. There's success, the fear of not being successful, of money, of belonging, of loneliness, and of health. Can you just talk about either all of those or any of those, just why it's important to tame those fears, and then how one goes about taming these fears?

Paul Millerd (00:40:45):
Yeah. So a big source of inspiration around this is Tim Ferriss' fear setting, and he basically forces you to write down what are your fears, how could you mitigate these. But more powerfully, the second part is... And you're framing them around action. And so he reframes, what is the cost of inaction? And that was really powerful for me, and it sort of exposed a lot of the costs in the current state of what I was doing. 

(00:41:16):
And so actually, I want to thank you. It's funny, you messaged me as I was listening to a podcast you were on. I think it was the one with David Perell. 

Lenny (00:41:26):
Yeah, I slid into your DMs.

Paul Millerd (00:41:31):
But I was listening to your podcast and you were talking about hiring a community manager. And this is actually something I've done in the past few weeks. And I think I was scared to commit to the community because I didn't want to create a job for myself.

(00:41:48):
And one thing I've realized is that I'm scared of creating a job for myself, but I sort of reframed the cost of inaction. What's the cost of inaction is if I don't actually hire someone, I'm going to drain all my creative energy, and that's an existential risk to this path. And so that's one example of I'm always thinking about these things, and that enabled me to take very quick action on that. 

(00:42:17):
But I think it was helpful to hear from you. You were like, "I'm not a community manager." And this is a big aha for me, because I launched my community at the beginning of this year. I suck at community management. I'm not good at it, but I found somebody that actually was good at it and I was like, "There are people that like this and are good at it." So that's one thing. I think more broadly though is some fears don't disappear. So that's a very specific project-based fear.

(00:42:47):
Existential fears around health, death, importance, money, they don't really go away. I think the great thing about this path for me is that you can't pretend like they don't exist. They sort of just punch you in the face. You'll wake up one day and you'll have an existential breakdown of, "What the heck am I doing? Is this sustainable? This is so silly. Am I going to run out of money? Next year, are my book sales going to tank?" And so the longer I've been on this path, those big worries turn into these small little daily things that pop up. And I'll sort of have a conversation with my fear and I'll say, "We're worrying about money today. Okay, I see you. Yeah, that's real. Yeah, I don't know if we can solve that, but yeah, six and a half years, let's keep going. Let's see if it works."

(00:43:48):
Yeah, that's the thing that makes me feel better every time something like that comes up is, it's worked this long. It's probably going to work for a lot longer. There's this concept of [inaudible 00:43:56], of the time something is going to last is usually as long as it's already lasted. And so that always makes me feel better. The main thing I think about, is am I going to run out of stuff with a newsletter to write about? And it's been four years now. I'm like, "Nah, it's probably going to keep going for at least four more years."

(00:44:12):
It's very important to dance with your fears and really get in with them. If I'm afraid of not making money, it's very reasonable that book sales will fall. And so I don't know if we can sustain our lifestyle on what I have set up two, three years down the road. But taking that fear and saying, "Okay, I'm going to solve that and make that fear go away by getting a job," is off the table. So I have no choice but to actually just be like, "Yeah, that fear's going to be here. It's going to be part of my life, and we're going to have to just deal with it."

Lenny (00:44:52):
Along those lines, is there a path you took that was a big failure or didn't work out, something that you thought was going to be a big opportunity and wasn't?

Paul Millerd (00:44:59):
The first 10 years of my career, I just kept jumping from job to job. I think I was looking for my current path in job shaped containers and I couldn't find it. And I was just so desperate to find a really good situation.

(00:45:15):
And there were all sorts of circumstances, like bosses who hired me, kept quitting immediately after I would join. Layoffs, all sorts of random things that happened that were very weird. And I just sort of kept searching. 

Lenny (00:45:33):
So I've been comfortable with trying things, and starting new things, and experimenting for a long time. And so one frame I have, I call it ship, quit, and learn, which is what is the quickest way I can ship something designed to quit, but as soon as I ship it, I learn about what to do next?

Paul Millerd (00:45:57):
And so this is how I started my podcast. I just said, "I'm going to do five episodes." I stole this from Tim Ferriss as well. I'm going to do five episodes. I'm going to see how it feels. And this is one of these things, super energizing. I love how I feel after podcast conversations. I'm going to keep doing it. I wasn't aiming at success, but it was like, "I know I can keep doing the podcast and my newsletter." I had that experience, that feeling from it, but there are things I've tried that I'm like, "Yeah, not again." A couple consulting and advisory type things early on in my path, it was like, "Whoa, I need to build in protectors such that I don't take a gig like this again."

Lenny (00:46:39):
I connect to something you said earlier, which I super resonate with, which is you want to avoid creating jobs for yourself that you don't enjoy with this path. There's so many things you could be doing and so many pulls that often, for me, it's like writing a book is always this thing that's out there. Actually, starting a podcast with one of these for a long time, "I don't want to start a podcast. Life is good. I got this awesome newsletter. Things are going great. Why would I want more work?"

(00:47:05):
Eventually I crumbled, and I did it, and here we are, and I'm happy I did. But there's all these other things that are always like, "I should do these things." But I think it's really important to pay attention to what do you not enjoy and don't do that. It's easy to create bad jobs for yourself.

(00:47:19):
A really clear example of that is finding a niche that you don't enjoy, spending time on in this life of writing about something you don't actually care about, or podcasting about something you don't care about. You just created a job for yourself you hate. Why would you do that? And so it comes back to paying attention to what gives you energy. 

Paul Millerd (00:47:37):
So I've created a lot of slack in my life. So I'd say 95% of my days, I cannot work. So I don't do meetings. I don't really have employees or anything like that. I have contractors, but I hire contractors for very specific roles. And I create systems such that we can do it asynchronously. And of course, I'll have conversations with them if they want to jump on a call. But I optimize for people that want asynchronous and work on those specific things. So I'm just very conscious of that.

(00:48:15):
I think one challenge I have now is I've created so many things that I'm doing a few things really well, and then sort of ignoring a lot of them. So I actually feel like I'm in this evolution right now of trying to figure out what comes next. 

(00:48:35):
So we haven't even talked about this, but I started this business strategy early on in my path because I wanted to productize my consulting. And one of the consulting projects I loved early on was training people on consulting skills. I did a training program for a consulting firm in Boston, and I was like, "Ooh, I could turn this into an online course." And that has slowly built and evolved, and I do workshops now with companies. And that made most of my money from years two to five when I started moving away from project-based consulting.

(00:49:13):
And so the game I was playing was make money from that, don't focus on it too much, spend minimal time, don't try to maximize for success. Create a self-paced course, because I am not interested in making more money in a cohort-based course, because I just don't want to spend the time. And then use all the abundant time to write and explore, create podcasts, spend time with my wife, and do all the non-work experiments, see how I feel and write about it.

(00:49:44):
Now I'm making money from the work I love, which is very weird. I'm going to make, I'll hit soon about $200,000 made for my book, which is mind-blowing. I published a book completely on my terms about what I love and loved the process of it. It's so crazy. 

Lenny (00:50:05):
That's amazing.

Paul Millerd (00:50:06):
And so now I'm building a community around that. That's really fun. I'm doing the podcast. I have some sponsors around that. And so that's sort of taking over. I still have this StrategyU though. 

(00:50:19):
So now I'm trying to figure out how to unwind some of these things. I'm actually exploring trying to find somebody that might want to start their own pathless path, like a strategy consultant that wants to leave that world, that wants to be an operator on this business. So if you're listening, I've recently come to terms with this might be the path forward. 

(00:50:38):
But yeah, it's a constant journey of protecting your time, creating that space, going down projects you want to execute, but then stepping back and like, "Okay, I have all this maintenance I'm doing. How do I outsource this, eliminate it, restart, recreate?" And I think this path is really just a commitment to constant reinvention, which is really, really hard. And you shouldn't do it unless you get some satisfaction out of personal reflection and that journey.

Lenny (00:51:09):
For someone that may want to help you with that program, what's the best way to reach out to you if they're just like, "Oh shit, this is a cool opportunity"?

Paul Millerd (00:51:14):
Yeah, Twitter, paul@strategyu.co, or I'm very easy to find. My email is all over the place. But yeah.

Lenny (00:51:22):
We'll link to it in the show notes too. Just a couple more questions. I feel like one criticism of this path is, is there anyone left to actually do work at companies and build things and scale if everyone ends up being on this pathless path, creating content, starting their own companies? Do you have any thoughts on that side of things? 

Paul Millerd (00:51:42):
I don't buy that, because I've met most people and most people are like, "Hell no," when they hear about my life.

(00:51:51):
I think it's an interesting critique. I also think there's a more secular trend of gigification of work. All the growth in the economy from 2005 to 2015 in the labor market came from alternative work arrangements. So if you search David Deming's work on this, it's pretty compelling. Right now, we don't really count non-traditional work that well, so it's really hard to get good data on this. But even the way companies are treating their internal talent, it's much more project-based. People are shifting around, moving to different roles a lot quicker. And I think that's going to continue. 

(00:52:29):
So you could make an argument that people will actually be able to slot into companies more easily in the future. Right now, companies under exploit the creator economy and the freelance economy, because they're so tied to you have to hire somebody through a full-time job. 

(00:52:47):
So I think there's two sides to that, is one, most people would hate my life. And two, the world is becoming more giggified. So it could go back the other way actually. 

Lenny (00:53:02):
I really like that advice. Paul, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with to maybe start down this pathless path or any other piece of advice before we get to very exciting lightning round?

Paul Millerd (00:53:14):
I think the key thing that doesn't get talked about enough is it might be hard and it might suck, but it might be worth it. And I think that's a hard reframe for people, because people will say, "Well, I'm worried about not knowing what I'll do or not making money and all these things." And it's like, yeah, I felt like after quitting my job. 

(00:53:44):
But man, I'm so glad I did it, because it enabled me to now know that I don't have regrets about trying this and figuring it out. And a lot of people that do go back to their jobs are so much happier, because they know I tested that, I found my boundaries, I need more stability. It's not this quit your job and get rich pitch. It's very much like if you're somebody that has a sense that there's something more, there probably is, and it might be worth exploring. 

Lenny (00:54:17):
What's the next step you recommend someone take to start exploring this pathless path? What's something they could do today or tomorrow or in the next-

Paul Millerd (00:54:24):
Read my book.

Lenny (00:54:26):
Perfect. 

Paul Millerd (00:54:28):
So I'm very committed to creating resources for people around this. My podcast is all conversations of people on an unconventional path, and sort of the inner game of work. And I don't talk about tactics and outcomes as much as really just, how does it feel? How'd you deal with that? Things like that. And so I do that in my newsletter, my podcast, etc. But just find people that are on interesting pasts and ask them about their lives. 

(00:54:59):
One interesting thing I've had happen to me over the past few years is I've just met a much more wider diversity of people. I'm friends with people that work at restaurants, and work part time, and work weird schedules, and work nine months of the year and take three months off. And now it just feels so much more normal what I'm doing, because before all I knew was full-time workers. I was working all the time, and that's all you're surrounded by. So yeah, try to find the weirdos. 

Lenny (00:55:30):
Awesome. And for folks that want to check out your book, should I just Google The Pathless Path? 

Paul Millerd (00:55:34):
Pathlesspath.com. I just moved over everything last month. 

Lenny (00:55:39):
Okay, great. And then we'll link to all of these things in the show notes. With that Paul, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? 

Paul Millerd (00:55:46):
I am ready. 

Lenny (00:55:48):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Paul Millerd (00:55:52):
Yeah, one is called The Great Work of Your Life. Sounds like a cheesy title, but that's actually a good resource for people that want to hear about people from history. Over the past several hundred years, different eras of people that really did design their life around work. It was really interesting, and that was a great book.

(00:56:16):
A second book I'd recommend, I actually really like Luke Burgis' book Wanting. That was another great personal story/deep dive into a nerdy topic. That's my favorite kind of book. That's the kind of book I wrote, which was personal memoir plus nerdy deep dive. And Luke Burgis' is really good too, more from a tech perspective, because he went down the startup path as well. Tut that's a great book. That was my favorite read of the year. 

Lenny (00:56:44):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show? 

Paul Millerd (00:56:47):
I struggle to answer this, because I'm not watching much TV. I did watch the Anthony Bourdain documentary. That was excellent. Talk about a pathless path, and the ups and downs, and the struggles, and the dark side of it. Man, that person was bringing forth what is inside of him and grappling with his demons at the same time. That was a powerful story worth watching.

Lenny (00:57:18):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you interview, say, contractors or anyone else you work with or hire? 

Paul Millerd (00:57:25):
I'm always curious about, what makes you come alive? I want to work with people that are alive, and connected, and inspired. So the two people I'm working with right now, one's a podcast producer in Poland, but he's doing a bunch of other stuff around video. And he's super energized, used to be a lawyer, reinventing himself. The other person is also a former finance person in India, and she's two years into this self-employment journey. She's writing and exploring all these ideas. So yeah, I'm always looking for that energy first and skills second.

Lenny (00:58:03):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Paul Millerd (00:58:07):
I really love the Nuna travel stroller. Super convenient for traveling.

Lenny (00:58:15):
We don't have the travel stroller, but we have the Nuna car seat.

Paul Millerd (00:58:17):
Yeah, yeah, we have that one too. It fits. So we've brought that around the world. That's been super convenient. And then more on the tech side, I just got into the esim game. That was amazing. And then ChatGPT, I just created my own GPT to do podcast show notes automatically for me today. Took me an hour to train it, and it is incredible, so that's amazing. 

Lenny (00:58:44):
That's awesome. I don't know if folks know, but there's a lennybot.com site that uses all of my podcast transcripts and newsletter to have a little bot that you could ask questions to. That's working actually, shockingly well. We're going to try using the new GPT thing that they just launched, where you can kind of train your own GPT and that'll be fun. And actually, a podcast listener reached out to me and offered to help build this thing, so that's a huge success story from this podcast. 

(00:59:12):
Next question, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, finding really useful in work or in life?

Paul Millerd (00:59:22):
One, coming alive over getting ahead. That's something I keep coming back to. I'm default skeptical of chasing achievement, and I use this to remind myself that it is about that personal energy versus extrinsic outcomes. 

(00:59:43):
I'm very convinced from my own life experience that the extrinsic outcomes aren't going to do a ton for me. Sure, I need to make enough money. But when I'm in extended states of feeling alive and connected to everything I'm doing in my life, that's it. And I basically repeated this mantra to myself right before rejecting the book deal. It was like I did not feel good in the conversation with the people. They talked down to me, they told me that I probably wouldn't succeed, and it was like coming alive over getting ahead. Don't need their prestige. 

Lenny (01:00:21):
Final question. You've been podcasting, I think, for six years. What's your best piece of advice for someone that wants to start podcasting, has maybe already been doing podcasting like myself, or being successful or anything along those lines?

Paul Millerd (01:00:36):
Yeah. I think if you want to podcast to make money, it's probably not something you should get into. Even if you have an audience, it's probably not the best way. I think if you have a massive audience, it can work, but it takes a really long time. Podcast is the ultimate long game, so you need to find some intrinsic connection to what you're actually doing. If you don't love the conversations or the format you're doing, don't do it. 

(01:01:05):
But yeah, I would recommend more people start podcasts. I'm against... The New York Times says there's too many podcasts, but I take the opposing view. I don't think there's that many podcasts. If you ask people in their personal life out of tech bubbles, "How many people in your life have a podcast?" Now in Austin, a lot of people have podcasts, but yeah, most people don't have a podcast. Even if you do something like interview your parents or anything, it's such a cool, creative thing. It's free. It's free, and you can send it to everyone in the world. Podcasts and newsletters are incredible innovations. Let it rip. You had to get permission to do these things 10, 15 years ago. It's so great to be alive in today's world. 

Lenny (01:01:52):
I feel like when people say there's too much of say newsletters, too many podcasts, my answer is always there's always room for better newsletters and better podcasts. If you can deliver more useful, valuable, interesting stuff, people are going to pay attention. The bar just keeps rising is the challenge.

Paul Millerd (01:02:08):
Yeah. It's also like do it for the sake of itself. Do it for the creative act. The creative act can be super meaningful in and of itself. I've lost money in my podcast over the lifetime of it. Love it. I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it. 

Lenny (01:02:27):
And also, the best stuff often comes from just doing it for yourself and then realizing, "Wow, other people might find this interesting."

Paul Millerd (01:02:33):
Yeah. I didn't start getting podcast feedback until the last two years when it started growing a lot more. I was sort of just doing it into the void. 

Lenny (01:02:43):
Speaking of that, Paul, we've been on our own pathless path. I feel like we're going to send a number of folks on their pathless path. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more about what you're sharing in your journey, and how can listeners be useful to you? 

Paul Millerd (01:03:01):
Yeah, so I've been compiling a lot of my more recent stuff under pathlesspath.com, that will link you to my podcast, newsletter, community, and book. And I'm always willing to gift my book to anyone in the world who wants it. Just email me. I'll even send you a printed copy, if you don't have the money to do it. And I'm always happy to send bulk orders to people that want to gift it and do book clubs or things like that. And happy to send it at the author rate, which is about $4 per book.

(01:03:34):
And yeah, I am starting to explore the potential of selling my StrategyU business or finding an owner operator who might want to get some sort of profit sharing or something like that. It'd be interesting if there are former consultants that might be interested in something like that. 

(01:03:54):
I don't know. I'm so bad at asking for help. I think if you want to share my book, that would be cool, because it is pretty neat to make money doing something from something I'm really proud of. 

Lenny (01:04:08):
Go buy The Pathless Path, available all online bookstores, I imagine. Paul, thank you so much for being here. 

Paul Millerd (01:04:15):
Amazing. Keep going on your path too. I'm really inspired by how you're approaching your path and sharing your reflections too. 

Lenny (01:04:23):
I appreciate that. Bye everyone.

Paul Millerd (01:04:25):
Adios.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You built and led Facebook news feeds. You shipped the Messenger app as its own app. You launched ChatGPT Enterprise. What's an important lesson you've learned about what it takes to succeed building something from idea to one to billions?

Peter Deng (00:00:12):
You have to plan your chess moves out in advance. You have to really think before you act and build systems that were going to let you go sustainably faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
What's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned?

Peter Deng (00:00:24):
Sometimes your product actually doesn't matter. At Uber, I learned this because, really, the price and the ETA at Uber was the product. Looking at it from a holistic perspective, we humans consume the entirety of the product. It's not to say that you shouldn't fix the bug, but it doesn't have as much of an impact as something that is more important to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
What's one specific thing you think will change in a big way with AI that people don't think enough about?

Peter Deng (00:00:47):
Education is going to change. My son, he was nine at the time, built a custom GPT that you can type in any topic and it would give you a sentence that had every letter of the English alphabet. Isn't that mind-blowing? I can already see his brain rewiring.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
What's one thing you look for in people you hire?

Peter Deng (00:01:03):
In 6 months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person. It helps me and the person operate on a different level where the goal is not, did you hit this OKR? The Meta goal becomes, are we calibrating enough? Are we actually getting into a spot where in 6 months you're the one telling me what needs to be done?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):
What's something you've learned about what it takes to be a great product person?

Peter Deng (00:01:23):
I think there are five different types of product managers. Number one is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Peter Deng. Peter is maybe the most under the radar impactful Product Leader that you have never heard of. I often say that the best product people are not the people on Twitter and LinkedIn sharing advice, but the people who don't have time to do that because they're too busy doing the work. Peter is the epitome of this. He was VP of product at OpenAI where he oversaw product design and engineering for ChatGPT and helped ship ChatGPT Enterprise, voice, memory, desktop, custom GPTs and more. He also oversaw and built their first growth team. He was the first Head of Product at Instagram where he worked closely with Mike and Kevin, and oversaw all product development, including on content sharing, ads, growth, even helped build out their design and user research functions. He was also a Head of the Rider product team at Uber where he oversaw everything in the Rider app, including big improvements to pickups and drop-offs at Uber Pool and airports.

(00:02:18):
He also helped the team launch new products including Uber Reserve, which is now approaching a $5 billion a year business. He also spent nearly 10 years at Facebook as their 4th ever Product Manager where he built and led the team behind the current Newsfeed product, the standalone Messenger app, also photos, and groups, and homepage, and profiles. He was also Chief Product Officer at Airtable where he helped the company systemize how they built products and transitioned to Enterprise. He also led product management at Oculus. These days he is General Partner at Felicis where he is able to bring everything he's learned to more founders as an investor. He has never done a podcast before or shared any of these lessons or stories publicly. So, you are in for a real treat.

(00:02:56):

Many of you are building AI products, which is why I am very excited to chat with Brandon Foo, founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey Brandon.

Brandon Foo (00:03:29):
Hey Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:31):
So, integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?

Brandon Foo (00:03:35):
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons: First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:54):
So, where does Paragon fit into all this?

Brandon Foo (00:03:56):
Well, these integrations are a pain to build, and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to a Agentic actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:10):
And I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.

Brandon Foo (00:04:15):
Exactly. And we believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like U.COM, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:29):

Peter Deng (00:05:45):
Thank you. I'm so thrilled to be here, really honored. Looking forward to having a great time here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:50):
As we were preparing for this conversation, we were jamming on what we should focus on. There's so much that we're going to talk about. But something that you said was really interesting and I'm really excited to start with this, which is that, you've always felt that you haven't been able to say all the things you really think and feel because you've been within corporations, PR people keeping you on message, and this is the first time that you feel free to share.

Peter Deng (00:06:11):
First time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:12):
Okay, so first of all, just how does that feel? Second of all, tell us something that you've been wanting to share or that you can finally talk about.

Peter Deng (00:06:19):
Well, it feels really good. So, let me ask... I love it that you're starting with a spicy question here and let me share some more context behind it. I'm here to speak more freely, but it's not really what you think. I'm not here to divulge any secrets from the companies. But naturally I'm kind of a storyteller, I'm kind of an introvert. So, this podcast, I feel like I have the ability to go deeper with you on any topic and kind of add the context. Because I think without some of the context, some of my spicy takes or whatnot might be taken out of context, and just not having the time pressure, not feeling like there's some PR message I have to hit, is just really freeing. So, it feels awesome, really anything that is on your mind that you should find interesting to your listeners, I'm here for it and yeah, I'm excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:07):
Something I always tell guests, and I don't want people to take this out of context also, but I always describe myself as a reverse journalist where I want the guests to be the best version of themselves. I never want to catch people off guard or just say something they never meant to say. So-

Peter Deng (00:07:21):
That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:22):
... it's a safe space. Okay. But still, is there anything that you want to share or that might be interesting to share that you've been wanting to share that you haven't been able to? Is there anything along those lines?

Peter Deng (00:07:31):
I mean, I always get this question around sort of, AGI, is it coming? Is it going to solve everything?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:38):
What have you seen?

Peter Deng (00:07:40):
I mean, it's so interesting because when I was at OpenAI, it was around the time that people were really scared of AI and, "Oh, it's going to get rid of humans or it's going to do all these things." But with every technology, I think everyone's been just kind of taking some time to acclimate to it. And I think with AGI it's a similar thing, which is it's so far out that everyone's like, "Well, what's our world going to be like?" And the real answer is none of us really know. But in terms of solving problems, I think some people believe AGI is going to solve everything, but I don't think so. AGI is just necessary but not sufficient. A lot of the value is still going to require a bunch of hustle from a lot of builders to really turn that new source of energy and channel it into something that we humans want to use that solves some of our problems. And that hustle is going to be required, that elbow grease is going to be required to really make AGI something useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:38):
Your point is that people think AGI hits, all of a sudden all jobs are gone, AGI is doing everything. Because I think this is a optimistic message that things will be okay if AGI, basically AGI being, and I'm curious if you have a clear definition, but AGI being, AI being just basically as smart as humans-

Peter Deng (00:08:56):
Look, I won't-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
... generally.

Peter Deng (00:08:57):
... claim to be an expert on this at all, but I think that with every technology that's come out, we've been able to harness it and it takes a lot of harnessing. I think I'm going to use that word very deliberately. I'll use something really basic. What seems obvious today is that, there was a time when databases were all the rage. It's like, "Oh my goodness, you can store a bunch of data and you can query it really quickly and imagine all the possibilities." And I think that a lot of amazing entrepreneurs and builders built some really great products on top of databases.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:30):
That's right.

Peter Deng (00:09:30):
In fact, that's kind of the basis of all the stuff that we're seeing today. And it seems so obvious today, but I don't know, maybe in 10 years, 15 years when we look back, it's like, "Of course it made sense that we have this super intelligent thinking machine." But it requires the product builders to be able to go in there and say, "How do we channel this energy to make it something that we as humans love to use and want to use?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
I love the optimism around this. It's just like things will not go crazy once computers are as generally intelligent as humans.

Peter Deng (00:10:03):
I think that's exactly what I'm trying to say. And I think that again, every technology people have this fear. And I remember watching a documentary once and they were talking about how when the bicycle came out, people were like, "Oh my goodness, this is going to be the end of all things." And again, it sounds silly today. Because you're like, "bicycles, really?" But then if you put yourself in the context and the mindset of a previous generation, which the next generation will be looking back at this podcast in that previous generation, I think that again, I think optimistically, things are going to be okay, we're going to adapt. And this was actually one of the things that I talked about with my friend Josh Constine at South by Southwest, is this idea that humans will always co-evolve with technology. And I think that that co-evolution is already happening.

(00:10:55):
If you take a look at, there was a lot of a fear of AI just when ChatGPT came out, but when you start to get familiar with it things, that kind of things change and then you are able to evolve from being fearful to familiar and to go all the way to having this mastery of this thing of like, "Oh my goodness, look at all the startups that are happening now. All the things that we can build. And just over 18 months." I would say we look back and there's been an attitude shift. And so I guess part of my optimism comes from, if you look back 18 months and you look forward 18 months, might it be the same thing for something that we're chasing now?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:35):
Well, let me follow this AI thread a little bit more and then we can move on to other things. I feel like every conversation, there's a time to AI conversation and then it's like, okay, there's other things that also matter. So, let me ask you this, the question, what's one specific thing you think will change in a big way with AI that people don't think enough about?

Peter Deng (00:11:52):
I think education is going to change in a big way. And I think a lot about this because I'm involved in my kid's school quite a bit, and that's something I've done after I left OpenAI. And what's fascinating to me is that watching my son who got to dog food, a bunch of the OpenAI stuff before it was public, I think I can safely say that, that seems okay. And when he was playing with ChatGPT and some of the latest models and he was nine at the time, I can already see his brain rewiring. He was starting to ask questions and he never heard the word prompt before, but he's like, just this is how awesome the human mind is, because he was exposed to this technology at an early age, some things just are unlocked. And I think that you're able to think differently. And I'll give you a specific example of what I mean here.

(00:12:51):
He goes to Python class and he's coding. Now, I don't actually think he's going to have to code when he grows up. I think that's going to be a solved problem. But it's a very valuable skill because I think learning to program is learning how to think in a structured way, in a systematic way. And he was prompting ChatGPT with some really crazy things that I never even thought of. And one of the things was, "Hey, ChatGPT, can you give me a sentence that has every letter in the alphabet along the theme of oceans or along the theme of space?"

(00:13:32):
And the reason this kind of blew my mind is because in traditional programming you couldn't write that program. You can't say in Python like, "Oh, write a function that goes and formulate." I mean, it's a really difficult function to write. But for him to be able to think of that prompt, which is really cool because he built a custom GPT that you can type in any topic and it would give you a sentence that had every letter of the English alphabet, kind of like the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Isn't that mind-blowing?

(00:14:08):
At age nine he could think about that, whereas being at age nine, I was playing with Legos and maybe QBasic. And so this idea of how young human's brains will evolve because of this new tool we have is going to change the way I think we're going to do education. And I'll be very honest, I'm not an expert in education, but I just thought a lot about it. And one thing I think is going to be really important in the future is being able to figure out how to ask the right questions. We humans are inherently inquisitive. But being inquisitive and turning that into the right questions to prompt or ask AI, which is going to be again, something that everyone's going to have access to is going to be a differentiator for what kind of work can be done.

(00:14:56):
The analogy I'll draw is, when the calculator was invented people didn't stop doing Math, they just did higher level Math. And it frees the mind up to do other things and think more at a higher level of abstraction. And I think we got to prepare our kids on thinking about, "Well, how do you think at a higher level of abstraction?" And this has happened before. I think Google has made memory kind of obsolete. You don't have to memorize facts anymore, you can just Google it. And the next phase will be something around, "Well code will just appear if you summon it." So, what are the things that people will think about and the skills we have to develop that are at the next level of abstraction, that tap into our creativity, that tap into our curiosity? That's going to be really interesting. So, I think education is going to change dramatically, just like how progressive education in the past switch from memorization of multiplication tables into something that's a little bit more kind of higher level, higher level thinking. And I think that's going to be one of those big areas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:12):
This makes me think about an NPR story I was just listening to where they were following professors using ChatGPT to create their curriculum. There was a lot of talk of students using ChatGPT, cheating, having ChatGPT write their essays. But teachers are using ChatGPT in a big way. And then students are raiding professors badly because they noticed they're using ChatGPT for their curriculum. So, it's kind of this arms race.

Peter Deng (00:16:35):
But it's also interesting because then that it goes further, it show further though. The whole system has to change. Because again, I still believe that human brains are inherently inquisitive and that we still need development in some way. But how that's going to develop, I'm fascinated to watch how that plays out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:53):
I want to get back to product, but first of all, I know something that you think a lot about along these lines. This came up in many conversations I had with folks that you worked with. Is your emphasis on the power and importance of language, being really good at thinking about the words you use both in writing and speaking. Just talk about how you think about that, just the importance and power of language as a leader.

Peter Deng (00:17:14):
I remember taking this class that really stuck with me in college. It was called Language and Thought. And it was taught by Herbert Clark. And he had this thesis that kind of blew my mind, which is that, "Language actually affects the way you think." That's one of the parts of the thesis. And once I heard that and read that in his book and listened to the lecture, I couldn't stop thinking about that because it just rang so true. I grew up speaking Chinese and I think that there's a lot of things of just the Chinese language that I feel like I noticed, I thought differently when I learned English. And there were some studies around this too, I think that there's, I think in, I'm not sure exactly, I just have to go check up on this. But I think in Russian there are two different words for blue, there's a greenish blue and a bright blue or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:11):
I speak Russian but it's like... I moved to the U.S. when I was 6 and so my Russian is not great. So, I'm trying to think of this as you say it, but keep going.

Peter Deng (00:18:17):
Well, so then this is great. So, I need to get a way to validate this. But from what I remember, because there were these two different words for these different shades of blue Russian speakers who then learned English had an easier time distinguishing between these two shades of blue than, and a faster time doing so than people who had just grown up speaking English. So, I read some studies over there. And also there's some other languages that don't actually have a word for blue, I think. And then that's actually really hard for them to distinguish over time. So, that really stuck with me and I think that it's kind of rings true. So, when I, how I put it in practice, is that when I make slide decks, I gave a presentation to a class a couple of weeks ago and there were probably a total of 20 words on the entire slide deck.

(00:19:07):
And I spent hours obsessing over them because I really wanted to make sure I captured the right essence of what I was trying to say. And I think that crafting is really important when you're working in product, because if you're sitting down and you're writing a vision doc or you're writing a PRD, and if you don't pay attention to the words you use, and you're not intentional about it, those have downstream effects. People might misinterpret things, the connotations may not actually come through. And so I really am very careful about it because I think that there's a multiplicative effect and a downstream effect for using the wrong word. And I really believe in that kind of language affecting thought thesis which is why I've just really, really paid attention to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:54):
Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I feel like AI can help you with that too.

Peter Deng (00:19:56):
Yes. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:56):
We had an episode-

Peter Deng (00:19:58):
Well, actually, speaking of AI, actually that's a really interesting point. I think it's really interesting and kind of poetic and fitting that the breakthrough in artificial intelligence came from large language models. It's interesting to me because there is, with every word in every sentence so much of the knowledge is encapsulated and shaped. And when ChatGPT does something really interesting, I tell people it's oftentimes just writing Python code and interpreting it. And Python is a language yet again. So, I think that there's something really interesting where like the condensation of human thought in language is related to the LLMs and the advancement scenario that we have today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
I think it was Ilya on a Dwarkesh's podcast where he was talking about, you may think LLMs are just like, "Oh, just predicting the next word, what's the big deal?" But in order to do that, it has to understand the universe and everything in the world that has ever happened and existed and everything anyone's ever written to predict the next word.

Peter Deng (00:21:00):
Yeah, love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Yeah. Okay. So, let me zoom out a little bit and shift a little bit to just product in general.

Peter Deng (00:21:07):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
You've worked at and built some of those iconic products in history. You worked at OpenAI, Facebook, Uber a Head of Product at Instagram. So, let me just ask you this question and see where this goes. What's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or leading teams that goes against common wisdom?

Peter Deng (00:21:26):
I think one thing that, it's a really hard lesson that I learned at Uber, which is sometimes your product actually doesn't matter. And by product I mean the pixels you put on the screen or things that you build in your mobile app. And at Uber, I learned this because, it pains me to say this, but really the price and the ETA at Uber was the product. And I think a lot of times people at tech companies think of the product as just this digital manifestation, but looking at it from a holistic perspective, we humans consume the entirety of the product. And I think that was one of the things that I learned, the lessons that I learned that was really kind of hard hitting, that sometimes the pixels don't matter as much as you think. And you fix a certain bug, it's not to say that you shouldn't fix the bug, but it doesn't have as much of an impact as something that is more important to people like a price or ETA.

(00:22:29):
And this happens a lot in B2B products where it's not just about how... It's great that your product is well-loved by its end users, but does it make good business sense? Is one of those hard lessons I learned as a very bright-eyed, bushy tailed sort of design-based product manager going into Uber. I think the other insight that I had or other thought I had the other day was just the idea that so many of the tech companies today, this is kind of counterintuitive, so many of the tech companies that are most valuable today didn't really start with any technological breakthrough. They were built on some kind of technological breakthrough and they ended up building a lot more technology. But really a lot of these companies, like Facebook for example, just put in the hard work, the elbow grease, especially in the early stages, to take essentially a database of human connections and build something valuable on top of it.

(00:23:31):
And that keep on polishing and iterating that product and coming up with new ones like newsfeed and photo tagging just kind of came out of just really paying attention to what people wanted. And some of the ideas are super simple and it's not something that came out of the lab. So, Uber for example, took the fact that everyone had these GPS devices in their pockets, and they didn't invent the GPS device, but they were able to take that and the fact that people had cars, and people wanted to get around, and there was a human need, and they just connected the dots, and put everything together.

(00:24:11):
And eventually, built a ton of tech to predict the right marketplace and pricing et cetera. But largely that's a very valuable tech company. But it's largely an operations company. And I want to give a huge shout-out to my colleagues there who run Uber Eats and Uber Rides from operations perspective. Because truly that was one of the biggest business model hacks that I've seen. And so I think that it's Silicon Valley it gets lost a lot. It's like, "Oh, this is a new tech company." Oftentimes some of the most valuable ones are just the ones that are just building what people need on top of existing tech.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:55):
There's so much to say here. I love it. And this is coming from someone that led the Uber Rider product team and worked at Facebook and a Head of Product at Instagram. It means a lot coming from someone like you, not someone that's not in product especially.

Peter Deng (00:25:10):
Yeah, I mean, just to go further on the Instagram part, the idea was super simple. It was showing photos and visual sharing. But the craft that Mike and Kevin had in putting in the hard work to get the product just right, that's what made it really take off. That's a great example. I had forgotten about Instagram, but how could I? But it wasn't anything that any other company couldn't have done, but it was that product taste that Kevin and Mike had and conviction that there's a certain sort of vibe, if you will, that people wanted, and building that and iterating, and look at it now, it's a core part of our lives. Visual sharing, they really solved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Yeah, I just had Mike Krieger on the podcast. So, it's interesting, there's two tensions here. One is just the product doesn't matter in a lot of really successful companies. It's secondary to the cars, the drivers, the GPS and the phone. And then on the other hand, there doesn't need to be a technological breakthrough to build a huge business. It's almost like if there's no technological breakthrough, then the product matters. Facebook is an example. Basically, it's like a database of connections, but what allowed an Instagram, what allowed them to breakthrough, and there's classically competitors at the time. Was the experience, was it a lot better? And then maybe on the flip side, if the experience doesn't matter, then it's the breakthrough is on the operations and other... Does that resonate? Is that kind of what you're saying?

Peter Deng (00:26:42):
It does resonate. I think both have to be true. But also I would say that even if you did found a company that has a huge technological breakthrough. Very shortly, I think that the product experience will start mattering, because how long does that technological advantage last before humans wisen up to be like, "Well, this is not the product I want to use. I use it a little bit differently and this is more ergonomic for me?" Et cetera. So, I think that what you said is a beautiful summary. I also think that a point in time in a company's history will also determine what is going to be more important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):
This is, especially, interesting for companies building on top of LLMs and AI infrastructure, where you're essentially saying, you don't need to have some kind of technological breakthrough to build something valuable if you can create a really special, unique experience that unlocks the potential of this super intelligence.

Peter Deng (00:27:37):
I think that's right. And I have some more thoughts on just sort of the companies that are building on top of LLMs that are just... That's a slightly different thing I would say. I think that for them, having the right data, and that right data flywheel's is so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:50):
Like proprietary data especially.

Peter Deng (00:27:52):
Exactly. And the flywheel part is just, you can start with proprietary data, but the flywheel is really just sort of how do you continue to maintain that and generate that. And the second thing is, again, it's the workflow. So, it's the ergonomics of how does it actually integrate into people's lives? And that is going to be more and more important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:11):
Well, let's actually spend more time there because a lot of people are thinking about this. It feels like everybody's trying to start a company these days with AI enabling so much more. And so I think a lot of people are just curious, where should they spend time? And so I think this is actually really interesting. So, what I'm hearing here is two things to think about to create any kind of moat, defensibility against, say, foundational models coming to your lunch or in other companies. What sort of data can you acquire that is proprietary and create a flywheel to generate more of that data? And then the other piece is how do you fit into a very specific, basically, vertical that you understand really well that fits into their existing workflow? Is that...? I'm probably right.

Peter Deng (00:28:52):
Yeah. Well, it's, again, this is something we can unpack for a long time. Because with any product that you want to build, there's going to be incumbents that have distribution advantages. But I do have this thesis that there are certain-

Peter Deng (00:29:03):
... have distribution advantages, but I do have this thesis that there are certain products that will be able to break through those advantages of the distribution of the other companies, but you have to overcome a pretty high bar of your product has to be so much better. I think that's one thing.

(00:29:18):
But yeah, I think that data flywheel thing is really interesting because the models will get really good at whatever data you show it, and that's one of the things that people just think that AI is such a magic wand. But no, it's like if it's been trained on the right data, it's going to do the thing that it's been trained on. It's very malleable.

(00:29:36):
Being very mindful of the data that you have access to to start your flywheel going and what you can do to keep on going with that flywheel is going to be a critical thing for anyone who's starting a company today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:50):
Let's make that even more specific. When you talk about this, I think about... The CEO of Windsurf was on the podcast and we talked a lot about how they've all this really unique data about which recommendations of code snippets people accept and reject and they actually launched their model I think based on that. Is that example? Any other examples to make this real?

Peter Deng (00:30:08):
That's a perfect example.

(00:30:10):
There's some companies I've invested in that aren't public yet that have their own take on that, which is really interesting to be able to take whatever activity is in their product to get smarter at the thing that they are doing, again, which is why I think the data flywheel and the workflow goes so hand in hand together, because if you are solving something actually valuable for businesses, for people, and there's a lot of that attention that's being paid to, a lot of work is being done through it, you're going to have that edge.

(00:30:45):
This is where I see again startups in very different markets who have this insight, who understand this very deeply, and are not just trying to zero shot everything and be like, "No, no, no. This is how we're going to build it to make the product genuinely useful so that it can get genuinely more useful over time."

(00:31:02):
That is going to be amazing because as a consumer of any of these products, we're going to benefit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:08):
What I'm hearing here is also if you don't have proprietary data or unique data, you can still have a chance by building this flywheel where you collect that data through your usage.

(00:31:18):
For example, Windsurf, if they all built on Claude 3.5 and then now they have all this unique data and now they're launching their models.

Peter Deng (00:31:25):
That's exactly right.

(00:31:26):
This goes back to something I might've mentioned briefly, but you got to have grit when you're building anything. You got to be able to have that vision, have that clear direction, and be able to really go chase that. I think that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:38):
To make your example of distribution being overcomable, a great example I think a lot about, and we had CPO, turns out there's many CPOs at Microsoft, I didn't realize how many CPOs they had, and I asked her about, "Why didn't Copilot..." The fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Bolt, all these guys. Copilot was so ahead of these companies and these companies broke through.

(00:32:05):
While Microsoft has distribution, amazing talent, infrastructure, all the things, early first mover advantage and it's to your point, they were just building products that were much better, Cursor, Windsurf, all these, Lovable, Bolt.

Peter Deng (00:32:17):
I do believe there is a level of product craft that will make it so that it's just worth it to switch or try something else. There are a few products out there that I see with this. I think Granola is one of them.

(00:32:31):
There's so many distribution advantages that Google Meet has, that Google, Facebook started off, Microsoft Teams has, Zoom has, but they're just these tiny little product craft delightful things that I really appreciate myself of like, "Yeah, they got it."

(00:32:50):
They have these little edges, set it down just right, and they've really figured out a way to really make it so delightful that it's like, "Yeah, I will install this piece of software. Yes, 100% I will talk to my friends about this because it is so life-changing."

(00:33:08):
We're starting to see that now. Again, before, I would say 18 months ago, it's like, "Oh, well, who has the best model?" But then coming forward, it's like really who has the best workflow and who has the best product, and we humans are just demanding. We want the best. And so when someone is going to come out and produce something that's so well-crafted, I think people are going to pay attention.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:28):
A couple of takeaways here is if you're trying to build an AI startup, a few things you should be thinking about that gives you a better chance of breaking through and winning is what are your data flywheels where you collect proprietary unique data, how do you build something the craft comes through and people are wowed and want to tell their friends about it.

(00:33:47):
Granola is a great example. Clearly, Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Rep, all these guys did that and then it feels like they just understand a vertical workflow really well and someone's problem and solve that in a really unique way.

Peter Deng (00:33:59):
Yeah. I couldn't have put it better myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:01):
Awesome.

(00:34:02):
Let me ask you, this came up in my chat with Mike at Anthropic and it's along these lines. I was thinking about just what is product doing at Anthropic.

(00:34:10):
They're building this basically a gigabrain super intelligence thing that's going to know everything and maybe build its own experience in the future. And then there's this product team building this layer on top to interact with this super intelligence gigabrain.

Peter Deng (00:34:24):
What is the point? What is the value of that layer?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):
You spoke to it a bit here of just there's value in the experience and feeling native, but I guess let me just ask you that. Just where do you think product goes at a company like Anthropic, OpenAI where there's just the super intelligence that the team is working on and there's this UX on top?

Peter Deng (00:34:41):
I think those companies have just such an advantage because you get to work in the same building as the researchers. I think that there's that really symbiotic relationship, close partnership between post training and product where, again, more and more it's going to be less about the raw intelligence, it's going to be about the fine tuning of what the model can do that really resonates with people and what people want and also what the product trajectory is going to be. I think that you're going to see that more and more.

(00:35:15):
I think this is less about Anthropic but more about OpenAI. I think OpenAI made a great move.

(00:35:21):
I am a huge Fidji fan. As soon as that news leaked that she was going to join, I texted her. I was like, "This is great. Amazing. Congratulations."

(00:35:29):
I'm thrilled for her, for the company, for all of my friends still at OpenAI because it's just going to be this amazing leader coming in.

(00:35:36):
I'm also thrilled as a consumer because some great products are going to come out.

(00:35:39):
I think really that close, tight-knit relationship at any of these large model companies between post training and product is going to produce some really incredible stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):
First of all, Mike actually said very similar things that the more-

Peter Deng (00:35:54):
I promise you I did not watch that podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):
It hasn't even come out yet so I believe you.

(00:35:59):
Yeah. He had this interesting finding where he put product people on UX product experience front-facing product and then he put PMs on the research teams and building models, helping models get better, helping researchers build things, and he found that all the leverage and wins came from the PMs working with the researchers, much less so on the product experience. And so he puts more and more PMs with that team.

Peter Deng (00:36:25):
I'm so thrilled to hear that because that's a little bit... It's very validating because that's what we did at OpenAI too. We were very closely tied to the post training team and it was because of that tight collaboration that you see some of the advances of ChatGPT getting better at so many things. It's great. It's awesome that we independently came to the same conclusion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:44):
Yes. It's a good sign.

(00:36:46):
Okay, so we're talking about startups, building new companies. I want to follow this thread a little bit.

Peter Deng (00:36:51):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
I feel like you've built more products from zero to one to scale than maybe most anyone else across all the companies that you've worked at. I'm going to do a quick rundown of some of the things you've done and I'm going to miss a bunch but let's see.

(00:37:06):
You built and led the Facebook Newsfeed, the current version of it. You built the new groups experience chat and messages. You shipped the Messenger app as its own app. That was one of your projects.

(00:37:16):
You led UberPool low-cost rides. You launched ChatGPT Enterprise. You shipped voice and vision, memory, custom GPTs, just refreshing the whole design of ChatGPT. Many more things.

(00:37:31):
A lot of work at Airtable obviously. Also, Oculus.

(00:37:35):
These are just some examples in the intro. I'm going to try to go through all these things.

(00:37:39):
All that to say, I feel like you've seen a lot of what works and doesn't work, building from idea from zero essentially to one to scale. So let me just ask you this question, what's an important lesson you've learned about what it takes to succeed building something from idea to one to billions?

Peter Deng (00:37:57):
Yeah. Thank you. That was a good trip down memory lane too when you read that off.

(00:38:04):
I think the first thing I would say, going from zero to one is different going from one to 100. When you are in the one to 100 phase, which is a lot of the time that I spent is the one to 100 phase, we quadruple Instagram usage in two years, that was very much a fun ride and there's a bunch of other examples at other companies.

(00:38:31):
But when you go to one to 100, I think one of the things that you really got to take into account is that you have to plan your chess moves out in advance. You have to really think before you act and build systems that are going to let you go sustainably faster, because the zero to one is you're trying to find that product market fit and then when you get to one to 100, you're trying to make sure you can get to hyperscale as fast as you can.

(00:38:59):
I've been very fortunate to be along the ride of many of these products as they were going through that hyperscale. And the analogy I always like to use is that when you do that, you feel the G-forces. Some people are like, "Oh, yeah, I'm a pilot, I can fly at 35,000 feet." But feeling the G-forces of takeoff of a rocket is very different.

(00:39:19):
One thing that I've learned there doing that a few times is you got to build the systems that help you move sustainably faster, and sometimes, you have to go slow to go fast.

(00:39:29):
Here's an example.

(00:39:31):
In building the Newsfeed, the current version that we have today, it really hasn't changed much from the time that we built it, I don't even know, it was like 12 years ago or something, I don't know the reason why it hasn't changed much.

(00:39:43):
But I like to think that it's because we put a lot of time and craft into thinking about the whole sharing loop and what are the key pieces of it and how is it architected, what's the information architecture, and what does that whole flow look like, how does it go from posting something at the top of the page to showing up in the newsfeed to someone clicking like and then that notifications thing lighting up red and then that repeating over and over again.

(00:40:11):
I like to think that Newsfeed has stood the test of time, the current version of it, because we thought very carefully about how people wanted to interact and how people wanted to consume information and also, that whole loop. When that happens, then I think things are built to last. I think this is a case at a lot of different companies.

(00:40:33):
When I was at Uber, we had a bit of a spaghetti string code situation on the writer app, but taking a step back and re-architecting things of what are the core components and how do you actually make it so that the product selector can scale around the world.

(00:40:48):
Here's a little known fact. Talk about grit and elbow grease.

(00:40:53):
Uber's not just as simple as finding a ride. If you've ever been to another country, like in India, sometimes, there are no street signs, so you have to pick up in front of this mini mart or whatever it might be. There's a whole team that worked on pickup and drop-offs. This was a large effort.

(00:41:08):
It sounds so boring but it was so critical to Uber being able to scale because pickup and drop-offs team thought about, "Well, how do you do it for venues?" That venues and finding that right abstraction means that you can have a scalable way to do pickups at airports and configure different venues.

(00:41:26):
Those systems when you take the time to build them in the one to 100 phase help you speed up massively and that's how you get 4x users in two years.

(00:41:37):
Or on Messenger, we put a lot of thought into the infrastructure around push notifications, etc. We grew that product from zero to 4.7 billion messages sent per day in about two and a half years. I think it really requires that forethought in building the right systems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
Let me follow that thread real quickly because that's really interesting.

(00:41:58):
Essentially, what you're saying is there's a phase of once you find product market fit, and I want to actually ask you this before you start planning, when you're starting to scale going from one to a hundred, your advice here is basically don't move fast and break things. Don't ship MVPs. This is the time to really think many chess moves ahead about what you're going to need to get this to, say, a billion users.

Peter Deng (00:42:21):
Yeah, yeah. It's building the systems and then that systems thinking will carry you really far, or at least that's been my experience and hopefully, you can find the same way but your biology may vary. But yeah, that's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
What's your guidance on just when to do that? Because you build something, okay, well it's working, there's also this just like, "Okay, let's just keep it going, let's scale it as far as we can." In your experience, is it... Just what's the guidance on when to really step back and really think years and years ahead?

Peter Deng (00:42:49):
Great question.

(00:42:50):
The first thing I'll say is that it's not a binary switch. It's actually a ramp rate.

(00:42:56):
When I've led teams, I've always believed strongly in this portfolio approach. Famously, Google had the 70-20-10 portfolio approach. That may be the right thing for a more mature company, maybe it's 50/50 if you're a startup, but you have to think about this in a non-binary way and in a way, that's about scaling up and when do you need to put more resources behind that.

(00:43:20):
Every startup is going to be different. Every product that you're launching is going to be different. And then thinking about your portfolio approach and how much you allocate your time that would be my advice. It's really dependent on the stage that you're in.

(00:43:35):
I think that actually is a nice dovetail to my second thing, if I may, which is when you're going from that stage of maybe one to five or one to 10, so not just fully one to 100, one thing I found to be very helpful is to measure everything.

(00:43:54):
This sounds, again, very simple but just like how you wouldn't fly a plane without instruments, why would you run your products without understanding the instrumentation and how it's doing.

(00:44:06):
One of the things I did in pretty much all the teams that I led, whether it was Instagram, Uber, Airtable, was all about... ChatGPT too.

(00:44:15):
One of the first things I did was always to build a growth team.

(00:44:19):
Building a growth team is really interesting because it actually is a simple razor, it's a simple thing to think about. It's like, "I'm going to build a growth team," but then you're going to uncover a lot of things.

(00:44:29):
You're going to uncover how much stuff you have not yet logged and how non-rigorous you've been looking at your entire product.

(00:44:38):
It's so funny because I've seen this movie so many times, the same movie so many times that every one of these companies where I remember walking into Instagram and I think asking Kevin and Mike, "So how many users do we have?" It's like, "Well, we don't really know." And so it's like, "Well, there are a lot and we don't really know."

(00:44:56):
When you build a growth team and you hire the right growth leader, I've had the pleasure of working with George Lee at Instagram, some of the early growth folks at Facebook, Andrew Chen at Uber, Airtable. I had the privilege of working with Lauryn, who is currently now leading growth at Notion. I've been very fortunate to work with some really amazing people on my team.

(00:45:20):
When you hire the right person, they start asking all the right questions because when the archetype of person who is a growth PM will be like, "Well, wait. Why is this happening? And let's get the data on X, Y and Z thing." That's when you realize you don't have X, Y, and Z thing logged and after you have X, Y, and Z thing logged, you look at the data, you're like, "Wait. Well, why is that happening?" And then you're forcing yourself to go deeper into the analysis of doing some analysis of like, "Well, what's correlated with what and what are some hypotheses?"

(00:45:49):
Because growth leaders, growth product leaders are so into this experimentation side, it actually is this really easy thing to do is when you start building a growth team, it just begets all of the right questions being asked and then it starts turning into all the right behaviors of taking something you've been building, which seems like it's working into a more rigorous system.

(00:46:12):
That's zero, sorry, the one to 10 phase I would say that really sets you up for the 10 to 100.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):
What I like about this growth team advice is that a lot of people think of a time to hire a growth team to we need to drive growth. What you're saying is there's a lot of second order benefits, which is they help you figure out what the hell's going on and inform a lot of other things that are happening, people just actually understanding how things are going.

Peter Deng (00:46:37):
Totally.

(00:46:38):
I think that the reason why growth team is the advice I would go with rather than to build an analytics team is because if you build an analytics team or a data science team, it's possible that no one's going to listen to them. It's like, "Oh, I have these insights." It's like, "Well, no one really cares."

(00:46:53):
But if you hire a growth leader, they are now tied to outcomes of driving growth, so they're going to be the ones who are listening and asking more questions and really partnering with that data science team to make your entire product and business more rigorous. That just changes the DNA of your entire team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):
I want to talk about hiring, but is there anything else along these lines that you want to share of building new products, scaling products?

Peter Deng (00:47:19):
I guess the last thing I would say is I want to make sure that sometimes in the pursuit of numbers, product folks lose sight of the importance of taste and craft. Maybe this is actually the dovetail into building teams, but you got to have the counterbalances.

(00:47:39):
It's really important to give two people on your team different charges. One is like go grow the product and the other one is wait, maintain that design, that beautiful aesthetic, the craft that your product is known for. That tension is extremely healthy. I've seen this at Facebook. I've seen this in Instagram. I helped create this at Instagram, this healthy tension. Airtable, same thing, but just having... ChatGPT, same exact thing.

(00:48:11):
You have to have that push and pull on both sides to really stretch the gamut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:16):
That begs the question, how do you actually do that? You could talk about it, you could be like, "Okay, we need to make sure the experience is awesome but also grow this number. Here's your goal." How do you operationalize that? Is it a performance review? Attribute thing? Is it culture or something else?

Peter Deng (00:48:29):
As a leader, you have to set up your team the right way. You have to really think about your team as a product and what are the various pieces you need to really stretch the gamut of what you're thinking about.

(00:48:47):
The teams that I've helped build are... The most successful ones are a team of Avengers that are just very different, have very different superpowers, but together you as the leader are the one who's helping adjudicate any differences or any disagreements but you know you're getting the best outcome when everyone's pulling and obsessing over a different thing. And that's important.

(00:49:11):
It's important to create your balance and really increase the space that you're looking at and create those healthy debates.

(00:49:20):
I think a lot of people overlook that. I think some people think of people on a team as warm bodies to do a job, but my philosophy has always been to think about, "Well, what does the company need to be successful and who's the best person who spikes at that one thing and how do I make sure that we get that person and how do we make sure we get the other person and the other person?"

(00:49:43):
It's almost like you're playing an RPG where everyone has different sliders and you have to create this super team where everyone actually spikes in different ways.

(00:49:52):
That is something that I've had a lot of success with in terms of when you create that environment and you create that vibe, you're going to get a lot of mileage out of that team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):
That is a really interesting answer. It's not one I've heard before. Essentially, it's not create the right incentives, it's hire people that naturally see the world in a certain way and that creates a balance and a healthy tension between say a PM and a designer and an engineer.

(00:50:22):
That is really interesting because that feels a lot more sustainable than like, "Here's your goal. But also when your goal is make sure the experience is great and people support tickets are down." It's just like naturally, they need to want this to happen.

Peter Deng (00:50:34):
Totally.

(00:50:34):
Actually, I have a framework around... I think there are five different types of product managers that has held true.

(00:50:45):
This is a framework that just came out of a random jam at Uber when I was talking to some of my colleagues there. We formulated this in terms of helping with hiring practices.

(00:50:55):
Everywhere I've gone, I've also been best friends with the recruiters because honestly my whole thing is got to build the right team. So we have to really partner very deeply.

(00:51:03):
At Uber, we developed these five archetypes of a PM. To this day, I still think it's actually exactly true and it still holds true to this day, but is that interesting? You want me to go into that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:19):
Absolutely. I'm so excited to hear what these are.

Peter Deng (00:51:22):
These are the five that I've found to be most enduring and actually the most different.

(00:51:27):
When you talk about... I love the way you put this, Lenny, which is when you hire the right people and they're naturally motivated by different things. These are the five that we came up.

(00:51:37):
Number one is the consumer PM. This is the person that's half designer, half product person, really obsessed over the details. "Is it delightful? Is it crafted enough? Oh my goodness, this is three pixels off. I can't stand it. This is driving me nuts. Why is this so complex?" These are the people that you think of as sometimes the criticism PM is the consumer PM, but that's just one type.

(00:52:08):
Another type, just on the other side we've talked about before, is the growth PM. These people are half data scientist, half product person, they are wired to think numbers first and they have this air about them that's like the best ones do, which is like, "I'm really skeptical. Show me the data. Let's run a test and prove it. I don't believe you." I start with these two in the framework because they're actually really different. One, it's like, "I have vibe, I feel the vibe, this is better," and the other one's like, "No. I don't believe you. We should test this and prove it." That's a really healthy tension.

(00:52:44):
I love having two people in a room debating that. I'm like, "Great. We are going to get some good things done and we're going to move the product forward."

(00:52:52):
The third type is what I call the GM PM or the business PM. These are half MBA, half product person. These are folks that are naturally wired to start with the business model and think about, "What are the margins? What are the opportunities? Where's the value being created?"

(00:53:11):
We had a lot of these at Uber and they were the marketplace PMs and they're just like...

(00:53:15):
I loved working with them because their minds just worked differently. They just thought about problems from like, "Well, what is the incentive here?" This is a fascinating type of mind to work with.

(00:53:26):
Another one I found, it's actually more nuanced than you think, is there's a certain archetype that I call the platform PM, which is someone who's really deeply wired to build tools for other people.

(00:53:42):
At Uber, we had internal platforms for messaging or for building internal tools.

(00:53:48):
Oftentimes, these folks are overlooked but it's actually a really deep wiring, because these are the people that are going to build the systems that are going to make you go faster. And that's what they love doing.

(00:53:58):
The last one, I would say, I used to call it an algorithms PM, but now in the world of AI, I'm going to rename this to research PM. These are half researcher, half engineer, half product person. These minds are amazing.

(00:54:16):
Basically, they think traditional Google search algorithm PM but nowadays, it's like who are the people who really have that product taste but deeply understand the tech and the way the models are trained to go and affect that and build the most amazing product.

(00:54:33):
Those are the five.

(00:54:34):
I still think to this day these hold true, and we might have been onto something the day that we brainstormed this at Uber but, yeah, I'm curious to hear your feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:42):
This is great. As you're talking, I'm just like, "Here's that person, here's that person. Okay, they fit here." This super resonates.

(00:54:49):

(00:55:40):
Just to summarize, there's consumer PMs, growth PMs, business/GM PMs, platform PMs and research PMs.

Peter Deng (00:55:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):
A lot of people call them AI PMs now. I feel like that's the term that's really [inaudible 00:55:51] now.

Peter Deng (00:55:51):
You have to evolve with the times. Yeah.

(00:55:53):
But also the other part of the framework I find interesting is that everyone has a primary one and a secondary one.

(00:56:00):
It's like one of those personality tests. Maybe we did this just because it was hard to pigeonhole people and I myself don't think I was pigeonholable, but I do think that people lead with one type of thinking and then also have the secondary thing that keeps them in balance.

(00:56:17):
If you believe that and you apply it to your team, I'm curious to hear from your listeners if this does resonate or not. Maybe this framework will help you realize that you're missing someone that you should be not missing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:31):
What was your archetype when you were a PM?

Peter Deng (00:56:35):
That's the other thing with personality types is the ones you hear. You're like, "This is me. I own this."

(00:56:39):
There's no doubt about it. I am a consumer PM and also a growth PM. That's my primarily consumer... I can't...

(00:56:48):
This is what I told you about the other products I've loved. I can see the details that people put into it and I so appreciate that. But at the end of the day, it's like, "We got to measure things." That's what I am. But again, everyone's different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):
I love your point about how a lot of people think of PM. They hear that first example and like, "Oh, I guess that's what I need to be, because that's what everyone talks about when they're amazing product managers." But you're saying there's many other ways to be a successful PM.

(00:57:14):
We did a personality test at Airbnb when I was there, and one of the biggest takeaways was it's like this color test and you get a color green or yellow, red, and the team was all over the spectrum. It was a really good reminder just you can be a different type of person and still be really successful in this role of PM.

(00:57:32):
It's probably because of these different archetypes and different needs and roles of PMs. There's this word product manager but there's many things that PMs do.

Peter Deng (00:57:40):
Also, as an investor now, it's really important to see the fit of the founder to the market because if you put a consumer PM into a really boring regulated industry, they're probably going to get frustrated and they're probably not going to see it through. Whereas there's people that you look at the pitch and you're like, "Wow. You are really passionate about this-"

Peter Deng (00:58:03):
... pitch and you're like, "Wow, you are really passionate about this problem, and you really care about building tools for others, and this is exactly," this is the Twilio PM or whatever it might be. "You're a perfect fit for this business and that's awesome," right? So I think, yeah, I love what you just said in the summary, because I think there's no one way to be a PM, and I think this is, hopefully this framework will give people a little bit more space to express who they really are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):
I'm curious if other functions also have these sort of archetypes, like designers and engineers, but we don't need to get into that. How about if you're listening to this on YouTube, leave a comment of which of these archetypes you think you might be. What's your primary and secondary? I'll read them again. Consumer PM, growth PM, business/GM PM, platform PM, research/AI PM?

Peter Deng (00:58:47):
Love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:47):
Okay. I want to talk about hiring. So this actually came up a lot when I was chatting with folks that you've worked with, especially Nick Turley, who's head of product at ChatGPT, who we're trying to get on the podcast. Because-

Peter Deng (00:58:57):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):
... that's an-

Peter Deng (00:58:59):
He's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:00):
That's what I've heard. So he told me that the current head of engineering, the lead product engineer, the head of design and head of marketing at ChatGPT are people that you hired. Also, many of the people you hired have gone on to do incredible things. You've shared a few of those names, many of them have been on the podcast, which is the ultimate measure of success. So let me just ask you this, what's one thing you look for in people you hire that you think people sleep on, that you think people aren't paying enough attention to, that helps you find amazing stars?

Peter Deng (00:59:33):
That's really flattering to hear that from Nick. Nick is one of the best people I've worked with, period. In fact, I want to just do a quick shout out. Folks at OpenAI are pretty much the best people I've ever worked with in my career. When I took the job, I told the team, "This is going to be my last operating role, and I'm going to leave it all on the field, and I'm just going to go all out.: And basically I spent probably as much time, if not more time on recruiting and building the team as I did thinking about the product. And this is going back to what I said earlier about, I think you got to bring the right people together to have a huge impact. And oftentimes leaders overlook this and they're like, "Ah, it's just a warm body," but truly, people who have strengths in certain areas compliment others with strengths in other areas. And when you build that team, amazing things happen. It's the best investment you can make. It's going to pay off so many dividends.

(01:00:27):
So I think that's my opening salvo in terms of you got to get ... Everyone who's listening out there, you got to make sure you look at everyone in your team, you look at what you need, and you have to get the best in each. And truly, in my farewell dinner at OpenAI, I think I closed with just, "Look, I don't even know what I would do after this, because all the best people I've worked with are here." We have Ian Silber running design there, Thomas Dimson, Joey Flynn, Ryan O'Rourke. Nick Turley was an amazing I met there. Joanne, I mean I have so many people I'm missing, but Coley on product marketing, Antonow on the marketing comms side, [inaudible 01:01:07], the list goes on. Product operations is stellar. I'm so proud of, honestly, the team that I built there more than the products. So I just wanted to say that it's a big thing that I really care about, and I hope more leaders think about that too, is really be mindful of putting your team together, and thinking about that as a product. And you have to really craft that. You have to really care about the team. So-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:31):
Just to double down on that point, actually, before you get to the next tip here, I just love this answer, which is, if I were to ask someone, "What's your hiring vice? What do you look for that people may not be looking for enough?" Most of it would be like in that person, here's what you need to focus on, and here's the interview question. But kind of your broad answer so far is it's not actually about the person, so much as what is the team going to look like, and where do we need spikes? Where do we need to balance out the composition of this Avengers that we're building?

Peter Deng (01:02:03):
Totally, totally. That's exactly right. And so that being said, I guess I have, I guess, on brand, I have two things I want to share about hiring the right team. I have this saying, I actually have this doc that I've taken around various companies called the PXD API, which is like, "Here's how to work with me." And in it, there's a saying that I have, which is what I really optimize for for everyone that I support and everyone I hire, which is in six months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person. And it's just kind of served me really well on three different levels. Number one, it's a reminder for myself when I'm either hiring, or looking for the person, is to keep my bar super high and just not settle. Because if I do, most likely in six months, it would not be true that I would be able to let this person run, and I would still be telling them what to do, which is not what I want. That is not my desire.

(01:03:07):
The second sort of effect of that is that it's ... I say that to people when they come on the team or as we're making the hire, because it communicates to them that that's my bar, and that's how they know they'll be successful, and something to kind of work towards.

(01:03:26):
And the third thing is kind of a joint thing for both of us, which is it kind of gives us, it helps me and the person operate on a different level, where the goal is not did you hit this OKR, did you hit this goal? The meta goal becomes, hey, are we calibrating enough? Are we actually getting to a spot where in six months, you're the one telling me what needs to be done? Are we getting there, right?

(01:03:55):
Because then, if that's the framing, every mistake that is made or whatever on either of our parts becomes a learning opportunity in terms of like, well, how do we grow from this to where we want to be in six months? And how is it possible that I, as a manager, can do the right things to set this person up for success, so that I don't have to be involved in six months?

(01:04:20):
And I think that those three things, and being able to have that second-order effect of this simple razor, in six months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person, it puts pressure on me, it puts pressure on the person, and it creates this really interesting environment and this kind of safe space to really think about, are we heading towards that goal? And again, every place I've been at, as much as I've loved building the product, I've taken so much pride in building the team, and it's just been so much of a pleasure. And I think this is one of the two secrets that I have here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
This is so good. I have a follow-up question, but just to point out why I think this is so genius is that there's kind a assumption here of this person, you can trust them. So there's like, do I trust this person? Do I feel like they're going to be proactive? Do I feel like they're going to have correct insights, essentially taste and gut feeling? It's like the layer below this question, which is great. And also just this autonomy, it feels like autonomy almost implies so many important traits of somebody that you want to hire. And I love just how simple this question is for both you and them to [inaudible 01:05:35]-

Peter Deng (01:05:36):
Thank you. And really with that autonomy, I love what you said about autonomy. Because truly, as a leader, as a manager, your goal is to scale. And if this simple statement is not true, how are you able to build the best company, the best product?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):
So here's the follow-up question. Is this mostly for leaders, like say a head of product at ChatGPT, say, someone's not a CPO, they're just like, I don't know, a manager of a PM team, is there a version of this that you think might be useful to them, or is this mostly for leaders?

Peter Deng (01:06:09):
I think this is for everyone. I think it's for everyone who is a manager. Because if you're going to be a successful manager at any company, or a leader at any company, and if you're starting as a line manager, or whatnot, and you're kind of wanting to grow, or even just wanting to ... If you're early at a company, you have so much institutional knowledge. And so getting more leverage in terms of being able to pass on the wisdom that you've learned is so crucial into being successful that I think every manager should approach their reports with this. Because truly, it's just good for everyone. It's good for the company to have more kind of leverage and scale. It's good for the person who is being brought onto the team, because they know what success looks like, and it gives them a path to keep on growing. And it's great for you as a leader, as a manager, to be able to basically scale up the entire expertise of your team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:17):
I imagine you don't even need to plan to not tell them what to do. It's just a good lens into, are they going to be amazing? Even if you plan to be telling them sort of what to do.

Peter Deng (01:07:31):
Yeah, exactly. The other thing is, again, in your interview process, you kind of end up looking for these insights, and you look for the behaviors of like, oh, are they actually going to be potentially able to achieve this in six months? And that's going to give you a really good lens on the picking side, not just the development side as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:47):
Peter, what's your second secret? This is one-for-one.

Peter Deng (01:07:51):
Yeah. Okay. The second one I'd say is, I feel really strongly about this, which is the area that I look for most is growth mindset. And I actually came to this some point in my management career at Facebook, where I did make a mistake and hired someone who just didn't quite have that growth mindset. And it was really difficult, because the way I say it's like, "Look, I don't have time to sugarcoat any feedback," and frankly, the best people I've worked with are the people who come into one-on-ones with me and yell at me and tell me I'm messing up. I love that, because there's nothing left unsaid, and we're able to kind of move the ball forward of, "Hey, how do we get better from this?" And I feel like growth mindset's one of those things, Lenny, that it feels really hard to teach at a certain age. And this is really important to me and my family, I expect growth mindset of myself, of my kids, my colleagues at work.

(01:08:50):
Because I think it just creates this environment where everyone is open to what's the one thing I can get better at? And that whole get 1% better every day can become true. And it's funny, whenever I go to teams like ChatGPT or Uber, when I'm always the final interview for someone in my org, and I partner with recruiting on developing the rubric, I always insist on doing the last interview. And I do ... not product sense, I don't do design, I don't do execution, I don't do metrics. I only do growth mindset.

(01:09:22):
And it's kind of like, well that's crazy. What about all of these other attributes? I'm like, "Well, I'm pretty sure I can trust the other people to assess the other attributes." But I think the growth mindset thing is so important to me, that we build a org where people are self-reflective, and want to get better, and take that feedback, and give that feedback. And it just is this meta unlock that I found to be true. And really, if you don't have growth mindset, and you're not open to feedback, and you're not open to learning, then that's the meta blocker. At that point, it's hard to get feedback, it's hard to onboard to a new skill. It's hard to develop in any sort of meaningful way. And so I found that to be the really critical piece.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:07):
That's a big deal what you just said there, that essentially as the CPO, head of product, big product leader at a company, your interview is not like, "Are you an amazing product manager? Do you have products taste," things like that. It's a growth mindset.

Peter Deng (01:10:24):
And I just want to clarify, it's because all the other things have been interviewed by the designer, by the engineering lead, et cetera. And that's where the previous principle comes into play as well, in terms of, I do trust my team to go and assess those people, but the one thing that I care so much about is growth mindset. And that's kind of the thing. And to be honest, I do do a little bit of a sweep. So if we got weak signal on one of those areas, I'll do it. But the pure focus of my last interview is going to be on growth mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):
Okay, well I need to ask you what that looks like. But before I do, when you talk about growth mindset, I have this image of Mark Benioff on the podcast, and I asked him, just like there's so much changing all the time. It's such a crazy world to be leading a company in this world, where just, everyone's disrupting each other, AI's changing everything. It's just moving so fast, every day there's a new breakthrough, and you have to keep track, and just like, how do you deal with that? And he's like, "You should be thinking, 'Good. This is amazing. This is the best time to be building. There's so much opportunity, so exciting. This is what we want.'"

Peter Deng (01:11:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:30):
"Good." I just remember saying like, "Good."

Peter Deng (01:11:33):
I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:34):
And I feel like that's the epitome of growth mindset.

Peter Deng (01:11:36):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:37):
Okay, so let me ask you just how do you tease out a strong growth mindset? What are some ways?

Peter Deng (01:11:43):
Well, good thing I'm not an operator anymore, because I'm going to give away my interview questions, so no one can cheat on this. I feel like this is another reason why this is such a great time to do this podcast. The question I asked has been the same one I've asked for years. And you can really kind suss it out from this, which is I asked them, think about one of the biggest mistakes you've made, truly, the more painful the better. And tell me what the mistake was. Describe to me the situation, and tell me actually how you actually think differently now, work differently as a result. How has that turned into a core principle of yours, et cetera.

(01:12:25):
And I give them a moment to think about it. Sometimes I even share some of my mistakes, if need be. And it's interesting, because I've asked this question so many times, I can smell the BS if they're not being authentic.

(01:12:41):
It's kind of like, "oh, I've worked too hard," or, "I did this thing." And they're really not being that ... You can tell the vulnerability that people are willing to express. And I reciprocate with that, if they ask me what mine is, I will tell them what it is. And then that's the vibe.

(01:12:56):
But what ends up happening is there's multiple reasons why this is really interesting. One, you get to get a sense of how reflective they are. And there's one woman, I was chatting with them, we actually went on for an hour, because she was just educating me on this amazing problem that she had made this mistake on, and how it changed the way that she worked, and the company worked. It was just incredible. And you can sense the passion, you can sense what's genuine. And then there are always, once in a while those things that people are just very, a little bit more defensive and not willing to open up. And it's safe. It's a one-on-one setting, so it's a safe space. And it's also, I don't think it actually selects for or against introverts or extroverts. I think at that point it's really genuine. And the second sort of order effect there is, if they end up coming on the team, you've already had that moment. You've already had that moment where you've just already said, "Hey, this is where I really messed up." And guess what? It's all okay. It's not a loss, it's a lesson. And so it just sets a different tone for your working relationship. So again, I've never A-B tested this, so I can't tell you if this actually, works or not, but I found it to be very helpful in the style that I work in, to be able to have that level of connection, whether it's with a direct report or somebody in New York.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
What I love about this answer is it's very much like Fail Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast, and I might tweak Fail Corner to be even closer to this question. Okay, so let me summarize these essentially two questions that you've found to be really helpful in finding these superstars that you've hired over the years. One is you ask people in six months, "If I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person." Or I guess, how do you say it when you say it to someone? Just like, "You're probably the wrong person for this?"

Peter Deng (01:14:48):
Well, it's actually framed a little bit differently. So there's five different part of my API, or just how to work best with me. There's five attributes of people that are most successful who work with me and I love working with. And one of them is framed as that you're telling me what to do, not the other way around.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):
Six months after joining.

Peter Deng (01:15:10):
Right, right. And then I follow up with, "In six months, if I'm still telling you to do, I've hired the wrong person."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:15):
Got it.

Peter Deng (01:15:15):
I think, that's how I frame it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
Okay. By the way, you should open source this PXD API doc.

Peter Deng (01:15:24):
I would love to. I think now I got nothing to hide. I'm just like, "Here, I'm an open book." So maybe we'll do that at some point. You'll make me brave enough to do that, maybe after this podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:33):
So you may find a link in the show notes for this podcast to the doc.

Peter Deng (01:15:36):
If I'm brave enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):
Okay. And then the other question you ask is, "Tell me essentially a story of when you failed, a product that you launched failed, and how that changed how you behave, how you think about product, how you operate."

Peter Deng (01:15:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):
Amazing. Okay, great. Okay, let's talk about management.

Peter Deng (01:15:56):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:56):
So this came up, so I talked to a bunch of people that have worked with you, and interestingly, one of the most recurring themes, it wasn't about AI, or ... Hiring came up a bit, but it was actually mostly about how skilled you are as a manager. And this all has already come through in a lot of the things we've talked about. So I want to talk about a couple things here.

Peter Deng (01:16:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:15):
One is someone that you worked with at OpenAI, Joanna Jang? Or is it Yang-

Peter Deng (01:16:20):
Joanne? Joanne.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:21):
Joanne. Joanne Jang, or Yang?

Peter Deng (01:16:24):
Yeah, Jang.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):
Jang. Okay, cool. You worked with her at OpenAI, and she shared a couple things that I think are really interesting. One is that you had a profound impact on her career by teaching her how to manage up more effectively. And you did that by teaching her a really simple phrase that she just says and uses. First of all, do you remember what that phrase is?

Peter Deng (01:16:44):
I've said a lot of stuff, and I've kind of forgotten. I tend to forget what I say, so you might have to remind me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:49):
Okay, so she said "Say you'll do the thing, do the thing, say you did the thing," as a skill of managing up. So just talk about that, just the power of that and what that's all about.

Peter Deng (01:16:59):
I mean, look, I learned this from my time at Uber, from Jill who runs PR, comms, and policy there, and she used to have this saying, which is like, "Repetition doesn't spoil the prayer." It's just a natural thing where people are busy. So whether you think about managing up or even managing the entire org, if you don't repeat what your goals are, if you don't repeat what your vision is, if you don't repeat the thing that you feel strongly about what you're doing, whether it's maybe to your manager, one, I think you might lose sight of the thing that's important. And I think this is where it's a little bit about behavior. This is another language affecting thought thing. By giving this phrase to Joanne, maybe it was just like, "Hey, let's just be very intentional about what we build." That becomes a constant reminder.

(01:17:55):
And it also has this other effect, where if you're saying, "This is what I'm doing," and then that's a thing that your manager's like, "Wait, we don't need to do that anymore," you can have a conversation about that. As opposed to just doing the thing and not saying that you're doing it.

(01:18:10):
So let me take a step back. So one, say what you're going to do. And then in that exercise you're going to be able to calibrate with your manager, again, with anyone, what is it that we're going to do? And I think the words are really important here, going back to what I said earlier, so figuring out what is that goal, and crafting that to really pack the most punch and the densest of concepts. And then you're telling them that you're doing it, which that's the second phase, which is like, in your one-on-ones or in your team all hands, you're saying, "This is what we're doing."It's a great time to reaffirm you're doing or invite the conversation that this is no longer the thing to do.

(01:18:51):
And you got to tell them you did it. So just close the loop, just be like, "Okay, great, this is now done." And I think that's, again, it's one of those really pithy phrases that has so many second-order effects that are behavioral, almost. And this is a little bit of a hack in terms of helping people. It's funny that Joanne thought of it as managing up, which it is, but in my mind it's almost like this is how we operate, and this is how we're successful to stay on task, stay on goal, and be able to revisit the goals that we've set when they no longer are relevant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):
So the phrase again is say you'll do the thing, do the thing, and then say that you did the thing.

Peter Deng (01:19:30):
Sorry, one more time. The way I would say it is, say you're going to do the thing, say that you're doing the thing, and then say that you did it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:40):
This also works for presentation advice. So this came up, I don't if it was Guy Kawasaki or someone, had a very similar phrase that was for how to present well, which is tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you just told them.

Peter Deng (01:19:55):
It's possible that I might've incepted it from there. So I take no ownership over this phrase. I will just say that yes, I did repeat it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:03):
This is great. And I love that this isn't just managing up advice, it's just operating advice for everyone. And there's an implication of, the last part is just make sure people know what you did, almost make sure that you get some credit, and people understand the impact you've had.

Peter Deng (01:20:19):
Which is important. I think there's a lot of people who are kind of introverted, and don't want to draw attention, and don't have the hero complex. And I think that those people tend to get lost in organizations. So if that describes you, just remember to say what you did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:34):
There's another management trait that Joanne shared that I want to spend a little time on, which is you're very good at helping people understand that they can lean into their strengths, and not feel like they need to fit into a certain box. She shared that you basically helped her create almost a new role within OpenAI that wasn't even a thing before. So just maybe share that example, and then just talk about why this is important, how you think about this.

Peter Deng (01:20:56):
Well, I love that we're talking about things that Joanne are telling you, because Joanne's really special. I got to just take a moment to give her a giant shout out. She is the only person that I've worked with that has as much technical depth as she does have product taste. And I just want to pause there. It's just truly special. I feel entirely privileged to have the chance to cross paths with her at OpenAI. I learned so much from her. Again, talk about not telling you what to do after six months. She was telling me what to do from day two, and I loved it, because she was so technical, and she has this taste and those two things are very rare to find together. And with Joanne, because she was so special in that way, and I spotted that, I was like, "Wow, I've worked with so many PMs and just like, this is very unique."

(01:21:44):
It felt like we had to find a way to craft this. And sure enough, I was like, "Hey, can you just write up a job description of what is this thing? Because there's something magical here, but I don't fully understand it." I don't think any other person really thinks of things this way, and think this might be a big superpower for OpenAI. Let's codify it." And again, going back to my language being a really important thing, I think the exercise sometimes of writing things down, of things that you intuitively feel, give you an artifact that can kind of communicate with somebody else. So in this case, Joanne writing down some of the things that she got really excited about, helped me really understand that. And I was luckily in a position where I can basically say, "Look, let's create this role. Let's create this role and have you lead it. And I think this is going to be great for the product if we're able to codify it."

(01:22:43):
So I don't think I did anything special. I was just following my instincts, and just following her lead. Again, I'll be clear, I did not author that document. My recollection, she did that. So she did all the hard work in all of this thing, and I don't want to take any credit for it. The only thing I did was just gave her a little nudge of, " I think there's something here. Can you just take a moment to go and write this down?" And when she did, it was just like, "Okay, this has got to be a role and you have to be the leader for this function."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:11):
What is the actual role she ended up in? I think that'd be really interesting to share.

Peter Deng (01:23:12):
The role was model designer, and it was just a really interesting way that she framed it. And I know this role probably exists in some incarnation in other foundational model companies, but the way that she described it, and the things that she found to be the spikes required, led us to hire our first two model designers after running a search. And they were just perfect fits for the team. And that, I think, is largely a big secret as to why, at least, I'm biased. I love ChatGPT so much, and the way the model comes off, and the vibe of the model, is largely because of this technical plus taste role that she has created and she's leading.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:56):
I love one of the interesting takeaways from this is as a leader is just pay attention to what people are really, really excited about, and then take the step of, let them try to describe it very clearly in a doc. Coming back to your point about the power of language and words is just like, "Okay, tell me exactly what you're thinking and let's jam on it, because maybe there's something here."

Peter Deng (01:24:16):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):
Is there anything broader here about just leaning into strengths that you find just ... There's a lot of people, there's all this debate of should I just work on the things I'm terrible at and that'll make me better, or should I find the things I'm amazing at and just get better at those things? Any thoughts there?

Peter Deng (01:24:29):
I genuinely believe that fit is a two-way street. And so what you are passionate about, what your strengths are, you got to really find the right company, the right role for you. And I think there's a lot of force fitting that people want to do is to fit into a certain archetype. I'm glad we talked about the PM archetypes. Hopefully that frees people up to really lean into what they love. Because life's pretty short. It'd be great if everyone would find the thing that they really wanted to do, and be able to lean in and do that. And I think the optimist to me is also why I'm so excited about the time and age that we're in right now, because there's so many different companies popping up. So there's something that really resonates with people.

(01:25:13):
I mean, take a look at just what we're doing here, it's like, podcasting was not a thing 20 years ago. It was not a thing. But now, we are able to have these amazing tools and platforms that allow people to really express themselves, and really, what really truly brings them joy and makes them happy, and also brings a ton of value to the world. So I think that, yeah, I definitely believe in leaning in strengths, and I think that as hard as it may be, sometimes you got to look at where you are right now, and is this the thing that you really want to do? Or is there something else that's drawing your attention and drawing you towards that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:52):
There's another management oriented question I want to ask you. This came from Eric Antonell, who apparently has worked with you for 17 years across a bunch of different-

Peter Deng (01:26:00):
Yeah, off and on for 17 years. One of my biggest mentors and friends, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:05):
Okay. So he's like, "You need to ask this question." So the way he put it is you've hired, managed, mentored many, many, many product people, some junior, some senior, across so many different cultures, and he's just like, "We need to learn something from your experience doing that," in terms of what you've learned about what it takes to be a really successful product person, whether it's being successful in building product or career-wise, what's just a nugget that you learned from seeing so many different types of people, and cultures, and seniority.

Peter Deng (01:26:38):
I think for a product person specifically, it's really important to obsess over the details of craft. Because ultimately, you're crafting a product. It's important to obsess about the details of craft, while simultaneously having the perspective and wisdom of which details don't actually matter. I'm going to pause there and just kind of try to-

Peter Deng (01:27:03):
I'm going to pause there and just try to unpack this a little bit because at the core of being a product person, you're like, oh, I want to build something that people love and that's the job and that's what draws people to be product people is that you have this desire to build. And I think that I've been involved in enough teams where I, myself, and when I was really young and coming up as a product person, I would just get obsessed over these little details and I realized afterwards that we've just wasted a bunch of time on something that didn't actually matter. So I think that dichotomy is somewhat interesting and beautiful to me because it capsulates both the core of what the ethos of a successful product person is, which is you really have to care and you have to give a crap about the product that you're building, but you also have to have the perspective and business know-how to understand where do you apply your time and where do you apply the care there?

(01:28:06):
And I myself feel like I've gone through cycles. Everything that I've done, I've gone super deep and really obsessed and then I take a step back and I'm like, wait, actually I was missing something and this other thing was more important, right? I'll give you an example. I'll use the Uber example here as what I said that the digital product didn't really matter and it's all about the price, the ETA, one of the products that I've built at Uber, which is Uber Reserve, right? It's the simplest of things. Going back to what I said before, sometimes the best products is the simplest of things. But the problem that we were trying to solve is that everyone has this. You have a 6 AM flight, and are you really going to wake up at 4 AM and request an Uber and hope that there's enough Ubers and the person's going to come?

(01:28:58):
Because if you do that, you're not going to sleep well and you're going to wake up every two hours and you're probably going to miss your flight anyway because you're going to fall asleep or whatever. And so there was this insight of like, okay, there's a whole mismatch between what people really want, which is the peace of mind that their car is going to be there and guess what? I'm willing to pay for that. And so we built Uber Reserve, which it was the simplest thing, which is like, oh, just go ahead and say what time your flight is and we'll work backwards or even just tell us when you want to get picked up and everything about that product we crafted what really mattered for the user, which was the peace of mind. So if you go there and you say what time your flight is and your pick-up time or whatever, I think that the product is... It hasn't changed that much since I was there.

(01:29:44):
It would tell you, oh, this is cutting it really close. You may not make your flight. It's like, wow. Again, that was put in there because of the principle of peace of mind. And on the other side it's like, well, what do drivers need? They need to know you're not going to cancel and all this other stuff. So you've got to think about the driver incentives too. So it was a simple idea, really proud of the team for figuring out all the intricate details, did some testing, and last I heard from folks internally, this is a $5 billion a year business now and one of the highest margin ones, and I'm really proud of this because it came from the idea of let's focus on what actually matters, which is that peace of mind and how many people really need it in that moment. So I think that's the best story I can tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:24):
That's an awesome story. It connects so many of the things you've talked about. One is just it may not be the product that really matters, and micro-optimizing the experience is not going to move the needle when there's something else that's more operationally oriented, but there's always going to be a product component if you're building it for freezers. The other piece that I think is interesting here is... Well, there's two. One is just it connects back to your point about the importance of autonomy of product people is just I feel like you're like, here's the team, here's what I'm told to work on. And then you're like, oh, but this thing is actually the problem we need to solve and let's just build a new product around it. And then there's a whole story I imagine of you getting buy-in and all that stuff.

(01:31:04):
The other thing this connects to, we just had the CPO of Uber, the current CPO of Uber on the podcast, and he had a few episodes before this one. It was all about dog fooding and basically exactly discovering these problems. He's done seven to 800 rides as an Uber driver to discover these problems. He had this great quote about, it's one thing to watch, just build an app for drivers sitting in your office making it look really pretty. It's another to be driving 60 miles an hour with this phone a few feet away from you trying to figure things out.

Peter Deng (01:31:34):
A hundred percent. Oh, I remember that I took two weeks off before I joined Uber. And in that time I've been obsessed with user research for the longest of times, and this is more relevant back then when you wanted to really understand how the wide massive users were using your product. And I remember I actually leased a car to drive for Uber those two weeks. So it was a little white VW something or another. I put an Uber sticker on it, I turned on the app and it just started driving and there's no better way to learn than to dog food, and I'll just build on what... Sachin is the person you had on the podcast? Yeah, he's an amazing, amazing guy. And so I'll just build on what he said there. I think that what really stuck with me in terms of framework that I learned back in school because I was brought up with the IDEO way of design thinking and I was at the design school at Stanford where before we literally were in trailers. That's how early it was.

(01:32:44):
But I remember the framework that really stuck with me is what IDEO preached, which is there are five stages to great design thinking. Number one is empathize, two is to define, three is to ideate, four is a prototype, and five is to test. And what I love about this framework, and I really hope this doesn't get lost because I don't know how much it's being preached nowadays in design thinking is that it has the right words associated with it. The first thing is empathizing. You've got to really feel the pain of your customers. It's not just about theoretically understanding what the problems are. It's really empathizing, which is why user research was so important to me is to understand that, or even like Sachin said, just taking those rides but also flying around the world. And when I was working at Uber to figure out, well, what are the various conditions?

(01:33:43):
And so empathize is a really powerful word. The define is also a really powerful word because it forces you to articulate what the problem is. And this is, again, going back to the language thing of you have to be very intentional about defining the problems that you want to solve and then ideate, we all know it's brainstorming and prototyping and tests are self-explanatory, but the first two stages I think are really insightful and it talks directly to what Sachin was saying. You've got to dog food because you really have to empathize and the great products are when you really feel the pain and you really empathize with what people are experiencing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:21):
That's a great connection to another podcast episode that came to mind as you were talking, the head of product at Linear, Nan, had this really great concept that's exactly what you're saying, which is as a product person, you want to feel the pain of your customer the same way they do. You shouldn't stop asking questions to understand what they're telling you until you feel the pain that they feel and that'll help you. Basically, that's like how to operationalize empathizing. It's just do you feel the suffering?

Peter Deng (01:34:48):
Yeah, and I really do hope product people still do this to this day because I think there's so many shortcuts that if people take, you're going to miss the point, right? I still remember distinctly flying down to LA with Kevin Systrom to go do a user research study, and it was a one-way glass thing where we listened to people talk about Instagram and how they use Instagram, and there's no substitute for that. I think that to anyone out there who's doing user interviews and then saying, hey ChatGPT, summarize the takeaways, you're missing the point. You can't empathize with the summary. You have to be in the room fully immersed, no phones, just actually hearing the words and the intonation. That's how you're going to get the full color.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
It makes me think Jeff Bezos has this great quote, if you have an anecdote and data and they're telling you different things, trust the anecdote. Oh, man. So many lessons. Okay, so to start to kind of wrap up our conversation, we covered a lot of ground, I want to ask you about Facebook real quick. So you joined Facebook very early. Eric Antonow, who I've mentioned previously, told me that it was very strange that you left Google to join Facebook at that stage. Google was killing it, on top of the world. You had such a strong career path, things were going great, but you decided to take a big leap joining Facebook. What did you see? Because I think there's something interesting here that we can learn about what you saw that may help other people decide where to go work.

Peter Deng (01:36:21):
I've always been enamored with this idea of understanding us as fundamentally human and how we're wired. And I remember at the time talking to the folks at Facebook and seeing it, and this was back when people were like, oh, this is just a college site, and that was the vibe back then. But what I saw was that the team and Mark and others really understood the fundamental human desires that people had to connect and feel lonely and to share, and they really got the right articulation of the problem they were trying to solve, which was to make the world more open and connected. And this really resonated with me because again, I study a lot in college like psychology, and I was really enamored with this idea of how are we as humans fundamentally wired? And it felt to me like a no-brainer to go work at Facebook because they saw how people were wired and how to actually build products that complement how people are wired.

(01:37:33):
And it wasn't that they were trying to force fit something into something that was unnatural. It was almost like how do we build technologies and products that actually augment our fundamental desire to stay connected? And this goes back to why I think the power of wars is so important is because you take a look at some of the mission statements for Friendster or MySpace, I don't even know if they had mission statements or what they were, they were kind of vapid and they didn't really speak to the fundamental humanity of what Facebook was striving to build and that just deeply resonated with me. And so I remember spending time with Eric being like, "Hey, what should I do? Should I take this offer from Facebook or should I stay at Google?" But ultimately it was just that deep resonance with my values of building things that were fundamentally human. And ultimately I think that for any startup out there, anyone building product, the more that you can get a good impedance match between what you're building and what humans fundamentally want and need, the more successful you're going to be.

(01:38:39):
So that's my big answer. I think the secondary answer, I've always optimized for learning in my career, and this is a huge thing that I say to a lot of people because they look at sort of like, oh, you've been at all these companies, what's your secret? I'm like, well, I've just figured out that I want to go to the place where I can learn the most. And for me, that wasn't really Google, but I had so much I wanted to learn from operating at Facebook. And at Facebook I would say, yeah, I was there for nine and a half years, but I always jumped around every two and a half or so when I feel like there was something new to learn. And that's it.

(01:39:27):
I mean, I don't know if it's a secret or not, I got lucky and I was able to have opportunities to learn different things and different skills, and that served me quite well. And regardless of any outcome, I would say that's just a great way to live your life personally is just to optimize for learning and those experiences and for me, moving to Facebook was that I saw so much learning that could have happened and it ultimately did happen. So I feel like that was a good outcome too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:55):
[inaudible 01:39:55] did it. So a couple takeaways here for folks that are maybe trying to decide between a couple roles, maybe deciding if they should leave and do something new is one, are you feeling like you're learning enough/is the new place you're thinking about going to help you learn a lot more? Two, is what they're building aligned with human behavior? Almost this impedance match that you described. It feels like there's another element you shared, which is do they have a really unique insight about how things work? And also do you really care about this? Is this also how you see the world? So you're talking about a Facebook, they have this really unique insight about human behavior and that was really important to you, and so it was a really good fit.

Peter Deng (01:40:35):
A hundred percent. Yeah. I think the insight thing, thank you for summarizing that and drawing that out because it's also what I look for and what I want to partner with companies and startups now is do you have that unique insight? Are you teaching me something that I really don't know? And that usually is a good indicator of a strong point of view, and having a strong point of view is really important because there's a saying that Mike and Kevin had at Instagram which is we may not be right, but at least we're not confused. I think it's a beautiful phrase I thought because sometimes you've just got to go and do the thing that you think is right and the indecision is going to be one of the things that really gets you and bites you. So that for me is something as I look for folks who have a strong conviction, whether it's the founders I support when I go join and be an operator at the company or the founders I support in my current role.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:35):
That's so interesting. Tomer Cohen, the CPO of LinkedIn, that's a famous phrase that he often uses too.

Peter Deng (01:41:41):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:42):
So I think he borrowed it from those guys. Yeah. That was one of his mottos. We may not be right, but we're not confused.

Peter Deng (01:41:48):
Wow, I didn't know that. So I did talk him at one point. I don't remember if that's something we talked about, but again, it could just be like great minds think alike, and we just had different great folks with Mike and Kevin and Tomer feeling the same vibes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:02):
I love just how many episodes this conversation has referenced. Okay, so speaking of learning, final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I'm going to take us to Fail Corner, which is very aligned with your growth mindset question. So the idea of this segment is people come on this podcast, they share all these amazing stories of everything's working out, I had so much success, worked at all these incredible companies, everything worked, but in reality, things don't often work out. Most people go through a lot of failed initiatives, projects, career hits, so the question is just what's a product that you built and launched that was just a big failure? And I'll ask it the way you ask it, how did that change the way you think and operate?

Peter Deng (01:42:47):
One example is, since we were talking about Instagram before, we tried to build a kind of camera first app at Instagram. It was called Bolt and it didn't work and the great levels of craft and design and the premise was essentially can we make it so it reduces the pressure to share, and you can open to a camera, you can just send some things to folks and you get some good feedback and you go from there. And it was obviously the Instagram design team, so it was top-notch. The app was designed really well. It was really fast because it's the Instagram engineering team and they were just really good at making performant mobile apps. It had all of the advantages that we had talked about that we valued at Instagram, but we launched it and I believe it was New Zealand or Australia and it didn't work.

(01:43:43):
And I remember the reason we knew this is as we were looking at sort of the retention graphs and retention is the key indicator in any product that you build, it's not the number of users, not the volume, it's actually retention and cohorted retention, you can [inaudible 01:44:00] the line and if it asymptotes, then you're in a good spot because that means that people over X period of time will continue to stay on the app and that just didn't happen. And I think the learning here was that you can really have the best team in the world with the best product taste and you can't really predict what's going to hit on the first go.

(01:44:24):
And failure is okay, you're just going to up and learn from that and nobody wallowed over that. We actually had some technology that we built there that we were able to port over to the main app, which was really helpful, but to quote the great american poet Sean Carter, "It ain't a loss, it's a lesson." And I think it's really important that you see that as a product person is that you don't see it as failure, you see it as kind of great. Now I'm that much smarter. And this is something that I've just collected. There's other examples as well, but I think this is a good example of sort of something that's somewhat counterintuitive, that you have the best team, you're going to provide those hits over and over, but sometimes you can't predict those hits and you just have to have the wisdom to be like, okay, let's see what we can learn here, see what we can save here, and then move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:20):
I absolutely remember that product in launch or heard about it, but I also don't ever think about it. And so I think it's a good reminder. Because Instagram launching a new product that's trying to rethink the way you do your camera, that's a big deal. And so I could see that being a really big deal for it not to work out. At the same time, nobody remembers that really.

Peter Deng (01:45:41):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:43):
Peter, we've gone for two hours at this point. I feel like we could do two hours more. We'll save that for another conversation.

Peter Deng (01:45:49):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:50):
Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you either wanted to share or want to leave listeners with to maybe double down on a point you made that you think might be helpful? Otherwise, we'll just jump right in.

Peter Deng (01:46:03):
I think we should jump right in because I feel like you've extracted every little ounce of what wisdom I had here and you did a great job here just helping me remember these stories and recounting stuff, so I'm ready to jump in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:17):
That's my goal, although I know there is much more that I haven't even started to tap, but with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Peter Deng (01:46:27):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:28):
Question one. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Peter Deng (01:46:32):
This is easy for me. Number one is Sapiens. If you're a product person, you have to understand our own humanity if you want to build products for people, straight up. That's a beautiful book. I read it before it was called Sapiens, it was called From Animals to Gods, and it was just republished in a different name, but it has really stuck with me and I remember, it's a very short, easy read, so I'd recommend that. The second book I think for product folks is a classic one, which is The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. This may seem outdated and old, but I promise you it's not. It really helps you understand physical product design, which is again, things that mold and shape to humanity. I think it gives you a good sense of that.

(01:47:16):
Third book is something I'm reading right now it was recommended by a friend of mine and I can't put it down. It's called The Silk Roads by Peter Frankopan. And basically this is a recounting of history through the lens of The Silk Road and the Middle East and how that's evolved. It's so fascinating because one of the things I love, Lenny, is seeing things from different perspectives. This is why travel's fun, this is why user research is fun for me, and it really helps you see the events of world history that we've all been experiencing through a very western viewpoint in a different way. And it kind of connects a bunch of things that are like, there's Western thought, there's Eastern thought, but if you see the connection between them, it's super fascinating. I'm only two, three or maybe four chapters in, but definitely something I would recommend off the bat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:07):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Peter Deng (01:48:11):
Maybe it's not as recent, but the one that always comes back to me is The Wire, HBO's The Wire. And I guess there's just so many TV shows now that I'm still processing, do I want to put it in my all-time greats? But the storytelling there and the various different sort of consistent characters, but the fact that there's the beautiful writing of The Wire is something that's unparalleled.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:33):
I'm now curious what's in your all-time greats list, but I'm not going to go there. We're going to keep going. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Peter Deng (01:48:40):
I'm just going to go with Granola because I think that we talked about this before, but this has been a superpower for me and I have a lot of commute time now. What I do is I just do a single player mode. I go up and I start thinking about and brainstorming about sort of ideas or theses I have for investing or whatnot, and I get to where I'm going and boom, they're organized in a more cogent way and oftentimes ways that I didn't even think about articulating them. So it goes through the process of forming words, but it also helps with that assistance and I think it's a beautiful product on many different levels.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:17):
Wow. Granola's killing it at this category recently, and I'll give a shout-out, you get a year free of Granola if you become a yearly subscriber of my newsletter, which is not just for you, but your entire team, they gave an incredible deal.

Peter Deng (01:49:30):
Is that true? I didn't know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:31):
A hundred percent true.

Peter Deng (01:49:32):
Okay, well I'll tell you, I was not compensated for that little pitch there, that's genuine right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:36):
I'm also not compensated. Yeah. If you go to lennysnewsletter.com and click bundle, you'll see a way to get it. Love the product, use it all the time. I should be using it for these interviews and then I could have a whole summary ready to go. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?

Peter Deng (01:49:53):
Yes. This is actually something that my dad taught me. It's a saying that is in Chinese. It actually rhymes in Chinese but kind of almost rhymes in English. And it goes something like this in English which is if you move a tree, it dies, but if you move a person, he thrives. And I think it's a really interesting thing I keep on coming back to, and this goes back to why for me it's just the joy of learning and trying new experiences and being at different companies that I've been very fortunate to be at. I really think that that's how you should live life is just to kind of experience these different experiences. And it's kind of poetic to be like, yeah, unfortunately for trees, you can't really move them after a while. But for humans, I think that you move them around and we get different travel experiences and we get different life experiences when we go to different jobs, and I think that makes life really worth living.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:47):
I always think about what I would answer to this question, and there's a few, but one is something I always come back to when my wife and I are deciding to do something is choose adventure. Similar sentiment. Final question. So you've now moved from product leader to investor, so I just want to give you a chance to tell people what kind of stuff you're looking for. So you moved [inaudible 01:51:11] now, investing in startups. What sort of startups are you looking for? Who should reach out if they're interested in-

Peter Deng (01:51:17):
Well, I appreciate that opportunity. Look, for me, I think it's been very clear. I just love working with great people and for me, investing is just the ability to support more amazing founders. I've always been drawn to the founder archetype, like working closely with Zach or with Travis or Howie, Brendan at Oculus, and folks at Opening Eye, I think there's this amazing sort of visionary person that I love supporting in one way or another. And I've supported them mainly from the inside as a product leader, but for me it's just finding those amazing founders. In this current role, I get to work with many founders at the same time. And just two days ago I had meaningful calls, product jams with three different founders in three different industries, and that kind of keeps my mind super alive. So that's kind of why I'm doing what I'm doing now, and I would love to find some more of those amazing thought partners and people that I can just help out if I can.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:21):
Okay. Stage and market, anything there for folks of like, okay, he's a fit, not a fit.

Peter Deng (01:52:27):
Absolutely. So I would say early stage seed, seed plus and A is where I really get excited. I feel like I am able to help folks see the next stage. I've seen a lot of movies in my life in my career, so it's like, oh, great, I can definitely see this extrapolating out. You'd have to convince me of the future, and then it's really fun to be able to jam and help support if I can in how you scale from the one to 10 and 10 to a hundred. So that's really big.

(01:52:53):
And then in terms of what I look for it's the two things I said before, in this day and age, there's so many amazing things that's going to be built. One is do you have unique data and do you have a data flywheel? Two, do you have a really crafted workflow that you can really get after? And I guess third, do you have that insight of what product things actually matter and also which ones don't? And then how do you actually go and expand upon that? So yeah, really excited to meet a bunch more founders, whether it comes from here or somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:23):
Okay, so final question and it's how do folks reach out if they want to actually talk to you about this and how can listeners be useful to you?

Peter Deng (01:53:28):
Thank you for the question. I am an introvert, so I'm really kind of silent on a lot of social media. I have accounts on X and Threads, but really I think LinkedIn is the network of choice for me. I want to be able to passively consume and learn about what's happening. How listeners can be helpful, I just want to learn. What are you all thinking about? What are some of the insights you're seeing? One of the analogies I have about AI in this day and age is that it's this really interesting new element that humanity has discovered. And what's awesome is that humanity is also very creative. And so what humanity does with this new element, I'm fascinated by, and you can tell the founders who've actually played with this element because they have this innate sense of what this thing can do and can't do, and I'm just looking to be inspired by the creativity of all you all out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:24):
Wow, that's such a cool way of thinking about it. It's going to change my perspective on AI a little bit. Peter, this was incredible. I really appreciate you taking the time to share so much wisdom. I know this is the first time you've done anything like this. I feel like this is going to help a lot of people in a lot of different ways. I feel like we covered everything I wanted to cover, so just again, thank you for-

Peter Deng (01:54:46):
Well, thank you for having me. This has been a real pleasure and hopefully some folks out there can get some learnings from this and find it useful, but that was my goal is to be able to share some things and hopefully it'll be helpful to some folks out there. So thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.

# How to be the best coach to product people | Petra Wille (Strong Product People)

## Transcript

Petra Wille (00:00:00):
Getting promoted is way harder if you're not good in telling stories and rallying the team behind the shared goal and all these kind of things, and you usually achieve this through good storytelling techniques. And in some teams, I've seen the product person not being really, really good at it, but then the whole team helped creating these stories and stuff like this. So you definitely could compensate to some extent, but I would consider it a bit of a career staller if you don't get to a decent level of storytelling and to a decent level of public speaking.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my aim here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Petra Wille. Petra is an independent product leadership coach and author of Strong Product People. And for the past 10 years, she's been helping product teams boost their skill sets and up their game. Alongside her freelance work, Petra organizes events in Hamburg, Germany, where she's based, and does a ton of one-on-one coaching, and speaking, and writing.

Lenny (00:01:03):
In our conversation, we focus on three things. One, how to become the best coach for PMs, which is really important if you're a new PM manager, and even if you're not a new manager. Two, how to become a better storyteller and why that's important for leaders at every stage of their career. And three, why finding a PM community is so valuable and how to go about finding one. Petra is awesome, and it was such a fun chat. And so with that, I bring you Petra Wille.

Lenny (00:01:32):
Hey, Ashley, Head of Marketing at Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:40):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:01:42):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:44):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:04):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:19):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. That's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:03:35):
Petra, thank you for being here. Welcome to our little podcast.

Petra Wille (00:03:39):
Hi, Lenny. Such an honor to be here on a Friday night.

Lenny (00:03:43):
Friday night your time, Friday morning my time. Thank you for making the time.

Petra Wille (00:03:47):
Of course.

Lenny (00:03:48):
You're a product leadership coach. Can you just talk about what you do as a product leadership coach and then also just a bit about the numbers of PMs you work with, the number of companies you work with, the impact you had, just to set a little bit of context in your background?

Petra Wille (00:04:01):
How I usually describe it is that I work with people leading product people, so that's the product leadership level that I'm looking at. So that might be a CPO in a smaller startup or a product director, a product team lead, these are the folks that I'm usually working with for the last four years, I'd say. And before that, I coached product managers, so IC level product folks. And before that, I did a lot of product discovery coaching for teams and whole product organizations. And you asked about how many people I may have influenced. That's a real hard question so to say. So in one-on-one coachings, that's what I know. I coached around 130 people so far over the last few years, which is already a lot. Most of them have, yeah, 10 to 20 sessions with me. Some really stick with me over the years so they have more sessions.

Petra Wille (00:04:55):
So that's that. And then I have group coaching sessions and corporate and then public setups. And that's, I would say, another 150. And it's all product leads. So usually, those people are working with a team of 10 product people and there are some ripple effects. So I think I have an impact on their lives as well if I'm coaching their boss or the line manager so to say. Plus, the teams that I work with as a discovery coach, plus the people that read my book and hopefully are using some of the techniques. And in the end, yeah, I did a bit of the math and I think it might be around 50,000, 60,000 people. If we look at it from the product leadership to IC level structure, yeah, that might be the impact. So that's a pretty impressive number.

Lenny (00:05:35):
Wow. That is an impressive number. And I always love chatting with folks that do the work you do because there's such a unique insight into working one on one with PMs that are trying to get better and understanding what trends are happening across PMs at different companies and different countries and things like that. So I'm excited to dig into a bunch of stuff.

Lenny (00:05:53):
The other thing that I love about where you're focused, there's a lot of people that focus on ICEPMs and there's a lot of people that focus on senior leaders, VPs, CPOs. And I love that it feels ... And correct me if I'm wrong, but you are focused on this middle layer of first line managers, directors.

Petra Wille (00:06:08):
Exactly, yes.

Lenny (00:06:08):
Which I feel like is often the most important and influential layer of a company because they're the ones doing a lot of the work at making a lot of the decisions day to day.

Petra Wille (00:06:16):
That is the case. Plus, at least with a lot of clients that I'm working with, they are not trained product people. So they often come from a marketing background, or a business background, or from the data background, so to say, or the engineering background, but they often never have worked in a product management role. So they're missing a lot of basic product management practice and a lot of empathy for the struggle of the product people to some extent. Plus, how should you help people grow if you have no clue what their role actually is all about? So that's what I actually like to help them with, to get this clarity on a strong compass how the best product organizations and product managers should be working.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Just to go a little bit on that tangent because that's an interesting point you just raised. When you work with folks that are not product people and that end up leading product people and trying to better product, what's the thing they lack most, the skill or the understanding of product? If you had to think of one or two things that these people are like, "Okay, they totally missed this part about product management, about building product."

Petra Wille (00:07:23):
One thing that has made me sense out the most is I see product people on the IC level have to go through some of the struggles on their own, even if our product community has some best practices to it. Because as the line manager has no clue about the product community out there and the craftless product management, they often struggle to point them in the right direction to say, "Hey, I think that's a problem somebody else already had. So maybe you could watch a talk or read this blog post or there's a book about this particular thing and then go try it." So that's the first thing. So product people IC level often have done to learn a lot of things on their own, so to say, because nobody's curating their progression for them to some extent. So that is one thing.

Petra Wille (00:08:13):
And then I use this metaphor of the eight-legged creature because people tend to talk about T-shaped employee profiles, but T-shaped is so not enough for a product person, right? We want them to understand underlying problems of the business and the users finding solution for those, getting things out of the door with the team, doing a lot of product discovery, looking at the data, how people are using it, iterating on the products. So there's so many things that we want them to be good at and to understand that and the complexity that the role actually brings with it. That's sometimes hard for people that have never worked as a product person to really understand. So, yeah, if I would need to pick two things, then that's maybe the two biggest differences.

Lenny (00:08:56):
The first one is such a great one. It comes up a lot on these chats of just how much of getting better product is just doing it. You can read all the books, you can take all the courses, you can read my newsletter, you can read your book, which we'll talk about, but there's only so far you'll get without actually just doing it and just failing, doing great things that succeed. And it takes years, right? It's not like something you'll do six months, "All right, I'm feeling really good about being a product manager."

Petra Wille (00:09:20):
Yeah, I totally agree. I so often have said the sentence of, it's not a role, it's a career being in product and, really, there's so many things to learn and so many things to get good at. Yeah, I totally agree.

Lenny (00:09:32):
Yeah, crazy ass role. Speaking of your book, you wrote a book, it's about product leadership and coaching, and we're going to touch on some of the things you wrote in the book, but can you just briefly describe the book that you wrote, who it's for, what it's about?

Petra Wille (00:09:42):
It's quite a niche book, right? So it's focusing on people managing product people, so product leads and then the people development part of their job. So it's not another book talking about how to come up with a great product strategy. There definitely is a chapter on that to some extent, but it's more how you coach those things. So it's not so much about how you do these things on your own, it's more how you could help product people to understand hypothesis-driven product discovery a bit more, or how could you help them think about team motivation, or how could you help them get better and giving feedback, all these kind of things.

Petra Wille (00:10:20):
So this book has this meta level of helping product leads to develop their product folks. And that is actually what the book talks about in five different parts. And I think 28 chapters if I get it right.

Lenny (00:10:35):
Wow, it's a lot of chapters. What is it called? Where can people find it? Just while we're on this topic and then we'll get into some of this.

Petra Wille (00:10:41):
It should be available on Amazon and it's Strong Product People: A Complete Guide to Developing Great Product Managers. That's actually the title and the subtitle, so to say.

Lenny (00:10:52):
Awesome. Strong Product People. Okay. I read parts of the book, I looked at a lot of the stuff that you write online and some of your videos, and there's three things that I want to spend our time together on to dig into. One is what you just talked about, how to become a better coach to product managers for PMs. Two is storytelling skills. You have a lot of great stuff on just becoming a better storyteller. And then three is how to find great community to become a better PM. Does that sound good?

Petra Wille (00:11:18):
Yeah, that sounds amazing. That stood up.

Lenny (00:11:21):
Okay, great. Awesome. So the first topic, basically, the premise of your book is just how to become a better coach to product managers. And for me, actually personally, the biggest inflection in my career was having an awesome manager who helped me become a better PM, and that was the point in my career where I really accelerated. And so I fully buy into the power of having a great manager and a coach, and oftentimes those aren't the same people. And you have these five ingredients that you have to be the best coach to product managers.

Lenny (00:11:52):
And so just to start, what are these five ingredients? What do you have to get right to be a great coach to PMs?

Petra Wille (00:11:57):
Yeah, I'm glad you're asking. So I was already referencing to number one. And number one is really having a solid definition of what a good product person looks like in your context. So what is your definition of good, so to say? And a lot of the product leads that I'm working with have this as an implicit feeling based, experience-based thing. They can talk about some of the aspects, but it's often the case that they not have fully reflected on what a personality traits that I want to see in product people that are hard to develop while I'm coaching them, and what are skills, and know-how, and capabilities that I want to see in the product people that I'm working with. And some are super good and have it all written down, but most of the product folks that I'm working with haven't. So that is step number one is doing this reflection.

Petra Wille (00:12:54):
Then step number two is having a clear idea where every PM currently is in their current career, in their situation, life in general, all these kind of things. So put the pin on the map, so to say, and then think about what is your vision for them in the future, so how good could it get? And I usually encourage product leads to think bigger than their current role at the current company because that's the longer term thing. And then even more important is what I call the next bigger challenge.

Petra Wille (00:13:27):
So what is the next bigger challenge I would love to assign this product person to if I could because I know that would help them to learn a new skill or to, yeah, again, you know how, whatever it is, right? And creating such a list once a quarter, for example, you block yourself an hour in your calendar, you write down the names of your direct reports, and then you just think about, "Okay, what would be this next bigger challenge for them?"

Petra Wille (00:13:53):
It's not always the case that this comes around the corner the next day. Sometimes it takes a quarter or two or three, but if you wrote it down, you will see this opportunity and then you could assign this person to the opportunity and really help them grow substantially over time. So that's number two. Then, hopefully, you share this vision you're having for them with them and do a bit of an alignment session because it's not always that they have the same things in mind. Maybe your vision for them opens up their thinking and reflection a little bit more, but you have to have this conversation where you actually see them, and that's a lot of encouragement and bringing out the best in them and these kind of things. Then it's definitely a development plan, but I think that's more on them than it is on you because you don't get the apps from other people's branches.

Petra Wille (00:14:45):
So you cannot really help them develop, but you could remind them of going to the gym, for example, which would be step number five, by the way, that's the follow-up. But the development plan is something where a lot of product managers need help with because that's the inspirational part, that's situational part. That's where you could help them to really see some of the differences between your definition of good and their current profile, and maybe they need to get better in prioritization, maybe user interviewing is something they want to get better at. And then you could help them defining steps that they could take small things that they could learn. Maybe it's a book, maybe it's giving a presentation at a conference, maybe it's reflecting on your way of prioritizing, and then look at what others are doing. So whatever it is, that is something you could help them with.

Petra Wille (00:15:30):
And then finally, it's the follow-up. That's sometimes just a nudge every once in a while at the water cooler to say, "Hey, how is it going with your personal development plan?" And some really need the weekly reminder and some maybe need even a daily email, whatever it is, ask them how they want to be reminded of the personal development and how you could help them and the system while doing that because they still have a day job, right? So the development will never be the number one priority, and it shouldn't.

Lenny (00:15:58):
Awesome. So just to summarize really quick, I have the list here in front of me. One is have a clear sense of just what it takes to be a competent PM in your role. Two is an idea of where that PM is today and one thing they could do to improve. Three is a shared vision of how they'll take that next step. Four is having a development plan of how they can move towards this vision. And then the last piece is a commitment, just following up with them and making sure they're staying on top of this.

Petra Wille (00:16:23):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:16:23):
What's interesting about this, just looking at this, it feels a lot like a roadmap and a strategy and a vision for a product. The definition where you're today is the problem, idea of where you're going to go next is like a strategy, and then there's a vision of where you're going to go together and then you check in. So it's these standups. Do you think of it that way at all or is that just something I'm noticing?

Petra Wille (00:16:42):
I think about it that way as well, even to an extent because so many companies are lacking the real strategy bit, right, and it's similar with the people development strategy. That is something that I see not being present in so many environments as well. So even that similarity is a given, I'd say. Yeah.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Which of these do you find is the most lacking usually or slash where do you think the biggest ... If someone were to just like, "I want to be a better manager," where would you suggest they start? Is it right at the top, figure out what a great PM at this company is?I'mq

Petra Wille (00:17:14):
That is a great question. No, I usually advise people to start with the development plan because even if you have never done the assessment and even if you don't have your compass, your definition of what makes a good product manager, you usually have an idea or they have an idea of what they want to learn next or where they want to get better at. So I said they say something like my storytelling capabilities are maybe not as good as they could be or prioritization is people are constantly complaining behind my back that they don't get the order of the things in my backlog or whatever it is, or they think my opportunity solution freeze, and suck, or whatever it is.

Petra Wille (00:17:55):
And you could use that and start helping them creating this development plan. That's not a structured assessment, but that's a perfect start. And then it's obviously the follow-up that makes a big difference and that just takes so little time from the product lead, the small notches, that's super easy. And these development plans, I usually tell people to create a new one with a new headline or topic once a quarter or every four months. So that is not a massive time invest as well. So that would be my suggestion for where to start, if that helps.

Lenny (00:18:29):
Yeah, I love that advice because I can imagine a lot of people get stuck in that first one of, "I don't know all of the things that I need to know about what a great PM right now is." So that's a nice simple way to start.

Petra Wille (00:18:38):
And there is another aspect to it. A lot of product leads try to create their compass. And while they do so, they think about, "Maybe I should have an aligned version with my peers." So the other product leads in the company. And then we're talking about the career levels and all these things and often takes ages until something is coming back from HR or you have a unified version. So that is something where I usually say, "No, start with your own personal team because the folks in your team usually just have you as a line manager. So grade your compass and encourage your peers to grade their compass and, a bit down the line, it might make sense to harmonize some of that, but it's better to start helping your product folks and giving them some orientation than being totally paralyzed by the fact that it's not a compass that is used in the whole company."

Lenny (00:19:31):
I want to talk about this compass and how to figure out what a competent PM is. And I know you have a framework around this and I have some stuff I'll actually share, too. But on this latter piece of checking in the development plan, I wrote about this once, but I'll share it here briefly. Something that I did with my PMs that was so effective was every time we did a performance review, every six months, we had a performance review, we put together a Google Doc with all of the things that we agree they should be working on and we pick, say, five themes or three themes, and then we pick very concrete things they should do over the next six months that will help them develop these things.

Lenny (00:20:06):
And then more importantly to your last point is we did a monthly coaching session where we looked at the status of each of these things. So there's a color code for each of these 10 things that we all agreed you should be doing these things over the next six months and we checked in how they're going, so that the next performance review, it's not like, "Oh, I forgot all these things."

Petra Wille (00:20:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:20:24):
It's all like, "Oh, yeah [inaudible 00:20:25].

Petra Wille (00:20:26):
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And really, all of us know consistency beats intensity. So, really, the smaller time investments on a weekly basis and that applies for the PM's time investment in learning new things and it applies to the product leads investment and helping their people to grow. I think for both parties, it's more likely and more pleasant if you have small chunks of people development in your calendar. And that's why I like your story, right, because you were focusing on regular check-ins more than into the big bang 360-degree reviews.

Lenny (00:21:00):
And it builds on what your point of the development plan is something the person develops like, "Here's what I believe I should be working on." And it's not like you inform it a bit and give them feedback and maybe this isn't or maybe [inaudible 00:21:12] this other thing. But, yeah, the fact that they own it, I think, is really powerful.

Petra Wille (00:21:16):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:21:16):
Going back to knowing what is a competent PM at a company. Something I want to ... I'll make sure to include in the show notes for this is I actually did all this research on the career ladders at all of the biggest tech companies. So I have the spreadsheet that it's public of just the skills that every company evaluates your PMs by, but most companies don't have. They're not great. So say your company doesn't have a career ladder competency framework leveling thing, what do you suggest folks do to help figure out what is a competent PM here at our company?

Petra Wille (00:21:50):
I'd say use one of the assessments that are already out there. Maybe we can include this as well. I wrote a blog post where I put all the ones that I'm aware of into, so there's the PM Daisy and, obviously, Marty Cagan has an assessment, and I created a framework called the PMwheel and there are a few others in there. Go find one that is close to what you actually think a good PM should look like and then customize it. Don't use it just by copy paste because sometimes you have just rather technical PMs in your organization and then all these assessment points about user interviews and discovery are maybe not that applicable in your situation, right?

Petra Wille (00:22:33):
So use one template that is close what you want to achieve, heavy customize it because it is really a great inspiration to see, "Oh, these are all the things that other people think a PM should be doing." Or maybe you could merge one or two of those and tailor it to your needs. So that will be my first suggestion. Plus, reflecting on the personality traits because I think there are some things that you better hire for and that are super hard to develop in a corporate environment. So for me, that, for example, is curiosity. I think product people need to be curious about the world, how it works, about things, no matter the topic.

Petra Wille (00:23:14):
The best product people that I know, whatever the topic is, they're interested and tell me more about it. So that is, for example, there's something I would always check when hiring product people because I know it's hard to build that muscle or empathy, definitely something that I want to hire for. I know that I can help them develop this muscle a bit more and stepping into shoes of users, and stakeholders, and colleagues easier. But still, if there is, yeah, not a decent level of empathy built into this person, then it's nearly impossible for me as a product lead to help them get towards a seasoned level. So that's another important thing. Think about personality traits and think about skills and know-how and to think about skills and know-how. Use some of the already established assessments.

Lenny (00:24:03):
So we will try to link to as many of those that you mentioned in the show notes. Maybe talk about the PMwheel, which is the framework that you suggest for folks to understand, just like what are all the skills that a PM needs to have.

Petra Wille (00:24:14):
It's hard to talk about that really briefly. So I split all the things that PMs usually do in eight buckets, so to say. And it starts with our day able to understand the underlying problems that users and the company actually is having. Are they good in finding solutions to those problems? Then they do some planning parts. Are they able to maybe come up with a roadmap or with good goals that are aligning the team, these kind of things. And it's get it done that's already able to actually deliver the thing to work with the team that's maybe writing backlog items and all these kind of things.

Petra Wille (00:24:51):
Then it's listen and learn. So are they able to really gather a lot of data these days and then look into what customers are actually saying. So the qualitative and quantitative aftermath of stuff going live. And are they able to iterate on the solutions that they shipped?

Petra Wille (00:25:07):
And then it's another three buckets that are a bit out of the PM process, which is team. So do they know about how teams actually are different from working with individuals? Do they think they have to motivate a team? Can you motivate a team? So this whole teamwork part. Then it's personal growth. I put it on my PMwheel because I want that to be part of every conversation that I have with my PM. So that's why it's on the wheel. And then last, but not least, it's agile because when I was still coaching PMs, I often found that they never reflected on the underlying basics of agile ways of working. So they often never heard about the agile manifesto, or agile values, or agile principles, no matter what framework they're using. But I think that is key. So that's bucket number eight.

Petra Wille (00:25:57):
And every of those buckets comes with at least 15 framing questions. So is this person good at doing this? Is this person good in doing that? And it hopefully gives you a really nice and well-rounded picture of where this person currently is. And I usually advise people to do a self-assessment, then ask their line management for an assessment, and ideally some of your team members because they have a different perspective on you as a product management personality as well.

Lenny (00:26:27):
So folks who want to see that, maybe they Google PMwheel, Petra, and also link to it. How did you develop this? I managed it and came from talking to a lot of PMs and just like, "Here's the things that I see again and again PMs need to be good at to be successful."

Petra Wille (00:26:42):
Yeah, it was actually ... That would have been pretty cool. It was more the personal need of me starting off as a product coach. And you had this sense of, "I need this compass," because how should you start a coaching conversation. I first have to learn about what is their perception about them and their capabilities in there and the help. And then I can help them work on some of the things they want to work on. But it is often that coaches come totally unprepared to the coaching, especially when the companies actually are paying it for them and to some extent forcing them into the coaching. And then they're just like, "Okay, they told me to show up. Petra, what should we do in these sessions?" And then that's why I created the PMwheel to have these first conversations about where they think we should invest more time in our coaching sessions. So that's how I created it.

Lenny (00:27:35):
Cool. Coming back to just the bigger question, we've been talking about just how to become a better manager lead, a coach to your product managers. It's interesting how simple it is. The way you frame this in your writing is it's like five ingredients to be the best coach your PMs have ever had. And if you look at this list of things to do, it's very straightforward and not a lot of work. Figure out what they need to do to be successful, where are they now, align on that with them, and then just give them some things to focus on to move closer to where they need to be. That doesn't take a lot of time.

Petra Wille (00:28:11):
Yeah, I totally agree. The book talks about some more aspects, actually. So that's more or less the first two parts of the book. And then there is more on onboarding and hiring, create product people. There is a lot more. So that's actually the biggest part about how to coach certain concepts of today's product management industry, so to say. Hypothesis-driven product development, for example.

Petra Wille (00:28:38):
How do you explain these concepts to people that are not yet familiar with these things? And really, it helps product leads to reflect, "Okay, what are the small things that I could help them to get better at certain things?" Because that's actually where a lot of the magic happens. We tend to read all the books and we tend to know all our thought leaders and all these kind of things, but our product people often need super practical advice. So maybe it's really something like explaining them the Eisenhower matrix for getting better time management because they never heard about anything that could help them prioritize their tasks because that's the reality that we find in a lot of the companies, right? So that big part of the book is really this, how do you really help them understand the small tasks and things that the daily work requests them to do.

Lenny (00:29:31):
I think a lot of that I find is when you need something, that's the time to find it, and introduce it, and read about it. There's so much content.

Petra Wille (00:29:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:41):
I'm guilty of this. Just there's a lot of stuff to read and listen to as a PM. And I find you don't need to be listening to and reading everything all the time. It's just like, I need to figure out how to prioritize. Let's see what's out there that's awesome. And maybe save it for the future, but there's so much stress, I think, that goes into like, "Oh my God, I got to read everything all the time."

Petra Wille (00:30:00):
Yeah, I totally agree. I think two weeks ago, one of my coaches told me that he stopped reading a lot of books and consuming a lot of content and he instead dedicates the whole year to using one methodology or book. So in that case, pick Teresa's Continuous Discovery Habits and that's what they read over and over again for the whole year. And I think it's an interesting way of looking at things.

Lenny (00:30:30):
That is interesting. That's a very committed, better pick the right book that are or whatever [inaudible 00:30:35].

Petra Wille (00:30:35):
Yeah, that she has said is true. Yeah. But maybe some of your colleagues pick another book and then you can just share what you learned, and what works better, and a bit of a community thing.

Lenny (00:30:44):
Oh, we're going to get to that. I like that. Before we get to retelling topic, is there anything else you want to share along the lines of the folks are just like, "I want to become a better coach to my PMs?" Any other thoughts you want to close with?

Petra Wille (00:30:57):
Yeah. One easy tip is get yourself a list of great questions that you could ask in one on ones if you don't have the time to prepare. That will be one of my tips as well. There's several great coaching books out there. Some of questions are in my book as well. Yeah, just find some coaching questions, make your small compilation, and then really see what resonates with your team, and that often is a bit of a health check. So how are you doing? What would make you more successful in the role that you're currently having? All these kind of things could be helpful.

Lenny (00:31:38):
Do you have any other examples of those? That's actually useful and just a few more examples of coaching questions.

Petra Wille (00:31:44):
Yeah, it really depends. So what I find super helpful is a list of emotions because people tend to find it really hard to talk about how they currently really are. And I don't know why this is the case, maybe it's stress, maybe it's not feeling comfortable to talk about this with your line manager, which is another topic, and bringing us back to the topic of company culture. But that, for example, is something that I always have handy. And if I have this notion of, "Okay, this person maybe really needs a hack to some extent," then this conversation about, "Hey, look, there is this list of 30 emotions, where do you think you currently add and why and could I help you with that?" So that could be something. And then there are ... I think you talked about Mochary the other day, right?

Lenny (00:32:31):
Yeah. That episode just came out.

Petra Wille (00:32:33):
Yeah, exactly. And he has a great framework as well. I would need to look the questions up, but maybe we put them in the show notes as well. That's a bit of in-house check as well and huge. First of all, it's five easy assessment questions for your folks. And then it's more of, "Okay, if you're ranking yourself a six, how could I help you to make it a seven?" So it really focuses on incremental improvements, not crazy stressing everybody out improvements, not, "What could I do to make it a 10?" It's more really, "How could I improve your situation? Really build rapport, really be there for your product folks.

Petra Wille (00:33:11):
And I think creating this list of coaching questions as a go-to list could improve the quality of your one on ones because, let's face it, we often run into those ones. Either we ditch them or we run into those ones completely unprepared. And a development plan could help and a prepared list of coaching questions could help to make it way easier. And for your PMs to feel more valued.

Lenny (00:33:37):
That's a great callback to the Matt. And by the way, his name's France, Matt Moshary, instead of Mochary. The C-H was like a sh.

Petra Wille (00:33:44):
I see.

Lenny (00:33:44):
Yeah. Now, we know.

Petra Wille (00:33:46):
[inaudible 00:33:46] learn something. Now, we know. That's good.

Lenny (00:33:49):
Yeah. And you pointed out in his curriculum, he has a bunch of questions that you mentioned about where are you at one to 10 on this thing and then how do we get you to ...

Petra Wille (00:33:56):
Yes.

Lenny (00:33:57):
... eight or nine. So we'll link to that in the show notes also. So many more things to read from this podcast.

Petra Wille (00:34:02):
So many things to link. Sorry.

Lenny (00:34:06):

Lenny (00:35:17):
Well, let's get to a happier, simpler topic, maybe not, storytelling. So just setting context. It feels like as a PM, also as a founder, also as just a leader of any kind, you're always told you need to be a great storyteller. That's a big part of leadership. Be a great storyteller because that gets people excited and onboard with your building. But it feels like I've heard so many things about becoming a better storyteller. There's always feels great when you're reading it and then you get to a deck you're starting or a meeting you're about to run or a doc and like, "Shit, how do I make this a good story?" I need some conflict maybe and a ... I don't know, there's a hero's journey, there's all these things that you're like, "I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing."

Lenny (00:36:02):
So I guess just a broad question. Say you're PM who wants to get better at storytelling, do you have any things you would suggest that are just concrete things someone could do today, tomorrow, this week to become a better storyteller, to level up their storytelling skills?

Petra Wille (00:36:18):
Yes, I think I would love to mention two things. So first of all, people that's starting, often they are getting a better storytelling journey. Often totally underestimate how many time actually great storytellers are investing in creating the stories and making sure they can share the story in nice ways and formats. So that's maybe the first tip, you have to plan to put in a lot of work to create your story.

Lenny (00:36:46):
And when you say a lot of work, what are you thinking? What's an order of magnitude of time depending on the scale of the story or a deck, or?

Petra Wille (00:36:55):
Rule of thumb. So I think if you ... Let's say you want to explain the rest of the company what you and the team are up for the next three to four months, so to say. Then I think that's two weeks of work, not eight hours a day, obviously, but two weeks of work, maybe one or two hours a day to really carve that story and think about different audiences and different framings of, when am I able to tell the story? And that is actually, I think, a rule of thumb of time investment. So it takes time because people often think, "I don't know, you just get better overnight in telling great stories." It's just not how it works. So you have to practice and you have to put in a lot of work and time to come up with a logical, compelling, motivating story that then lasts for longer than a week or two. So that's a lot of work.

Petra Wille (00:37:48):
And then the other tip would be really make sure that you're using language that speaks to the heart and the minds of the people because we constantly tend to use too much of our business lingo and it's banner blindness. Some of the words that we're using people totally overhearing them because we're using them so often. And it could be even things like product discovery. So maybe your company is already so fed up with all your product discovery stuff that you should start using different terms. Even if then, say, hypothesis-driven product management, it's more or less the same thing, and maybe it's even too complex. Maybe you can find something simpler and say, "We need to learn something about this particular thing," because studies show that's a scientific background. Stories really have an impact on our brain.

Petra Wille (00:38:45):
So hormones get released depending on how the story is actually formed, if they have cliffhangers or if it's really like, whoa, with the hero and think, "Where is it going to take him", or something like that. And that releases, yeah, hormones in your brain and that only happens if you're using natural world, so to say. So you could talk about smell, and sense, and how people feel, and how their life would be better if this product would be out, all these kind of things. So really make sure that you think about that really speak to their minds and to their hearts and remove all your three-letter abbreviations and all these kind of things, which is something that everybody says as well. But it is way harder to do it when you really start to create your story to remove all these terms. And that takes a lot of time, yeah, as well. So you have to really put an effort into the don't use too much [inaudible 00:39:46].

Lenny (00:39:47):
So the first point, which I love, is you think people are just good at this and naturally great at telling a great story. But a lot of it is ... Right. Some people are ... You do it enough and you're like, "It'll be quicker probably." But for most people, it's going to be just put in the time and it gets better and better and your story merges, you practice.

Petra Wille (00:40:04):
Yeah. And it's a cultural thing. So I really find in average Americans, for example, being better at it than most of us Europeans. And I think that's because even in your school system, it seems to me, I don't know, you tell me if that is the case, but storytelling and being in front of a class or something like this is something that is encouraged and valued already, where at least when I was at school, this was not part of the whole system at all. So really late it was part of what we did, but not from an early age. So it's just not something, yeah, that we trained in or that we used to. So sometimes even speaking in front of 30 people, people are freaking out because they never did that. So that's their cultural differences to that definitely as well.

Lenny (00:40:57):
Speaking of the idea of speaking in public and being nervous and that kind of thing, which I always get really nervous speaking in public and people don't think that when they hear me and other folks that are publicly speaking, but it's like freaks me out every time. Do you have any advice for people that want to become better public speakers/be less nervous speaking publicly?

Petra Wille (00:41:20):
I was really bad in [inaudible 00:41:21] as well, I have to tell you. And it's still not something that I love, but I know it's part of the work that we do.

Lenny (00:41:30):
Yeah.

Petra Wille (00:41:31):
And so the easiest way is to get in front of really small and super friendly audiences. So that is, I think, the first starting point. And I don't know where that is. That could be your team, that's a super small audience, usually five to 10 people, or maybe you pine with your company of 80 people or 120 people, maybe the company all-hands is already something where you could actually speak. That was my first time and I had to speak in front of the whole company at a company all-hands around 90 people back at the time. And I only had to give a brief update on what we did the last two weeks and it was like five minutes on stage, but it freaked me out.

Petra Wille (00:42:14):
So that's where I'm coming from and it really helped me to start small. Then product tanks, for example, this local product community meetups totally helped me because friendly human beings and not too many of them. So sometimes they're just 30 people attending and then you in the summer, not so many people are coming, so why not giving a talk there? So really start small and then grow the audience over time and always make sure, because that helped me a lot, to get feedback from strangers and peers if possible. Because the peers tend to give you the harsher critique, so to say, where the strangers are more polite, but they're not so familiar with the work you do or with the story that you want to tell so they can spot some gaps in your storytelling technique or something like that.

Petra Wille (00:43:07):
So that is something that helped me a lot to always have this friendly soul in the front row, where I know I get some feedback from later on. Plus, then having complete strangers and there's always somebody coming up after the talk, right, so they could be your first person giving you some stranger feedback, so to say.

Lenny (00:43:25):
What about if you're just about to give a talk and you're like, "Oh my god, I'm so nervous," do you find anything that helps you get over that?

Petra Wille (00:43:33):
I think the two things that work well, it's either the Superman pose, so that is one thing. If you're standing like this looking straightly up, that is one thing that helps many people. It's not my preferred one. And then the other one is a bit of the gorilla thing, just like tapping here. There is ... I don't know what's the English-

Lenny (00:43:56):
Vagus, the vagus nerve.

Petra Wille (00:43:57):
No, it's not the vagus nerve.

Lenny (00:43:57):
Oh, a different.

Petra Wille (00:43:58):
I think it's thymus.

Lenny (00:43:58):
Okay.

Petra Wille (00:43:59):
I need to look it up. And if you just, yeah, hit that softly for some time ...

Lenny (00:44:07):
Yeah, I can hear it.

Petra Wille (00:44:07):
... then, yeah, that bumps your energy level, so to say. So that helps me. And again, friendly faces front row. So find people that you like and respect and that you know have the spark in their eyes when you start talking. That definitely helps as well.

Lenny (00:44:24):
Do you suggest doing these moves in the bathroom where no one can see you, or?

Petra Wille (00:44:29):
Yes, backstage. You're doing those ones backstage. And think about what you're wearing because if you're wearing something like that and do this before you enter the stage, people might see that.

Lenny (00:44:38):
They might love that.

Petra Wille (00:44:38):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:38):
Just come out beating your chest. It's a power move.

Petra Wille (00:44:38):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Do you think it's important for PMs and leaders in general to get great at public speaking or do you think it's okay if they are just okay?

Petra Wille (00:44:53):
It really depends. So I think not being able to speak publicly and to bring your point across ... Because a lot of people do public speaking, but they never bring their point across. So if you want to achieve both things, I think it is a career solo if you can for a product person. Can do the IC level product management job, but getting promoted is way harder if you're not good in telling stories and rallying the team behind the shared goal and all these kind of things. And you usually achieve this through good storytelling techniques.

Petra Wille (00:45:33):
And in some teams, I've seen the product person not being really, really good at it, but then the whole team helped creating the stories and stuff like this. So you definitely could compensate to some extent, but I would consider it a bit of a career solo if you don't get to decent level of storytelling and to a decent level of public speaking. So, yeah, I think it's important.

Lenny (00:45:54):
Who's the best storyteller PM that you've met and what made them great?

Petra Wille (00:45:59):
That's another hard question. So who had the biggest influence on me was definitely Jason Goldberg. He was my former boss and he was the first person that came into the startup that I was working for back at the time. And he was really the first person who entered every stage that he could find to talk about the things that he wants to achieve with us as a product team and as a product organization. In a way, it was really motivational, so it really helped me to experience that and how he was using this product, evangelizing techniques, yeah, to actually really tell the whole company what we're up for currently and what the problems out there he thinks are worth solving. So that was definitely an inspiration.

Petra Wille (00:46:47):
And then I think another great speaker is definitely Hans Rosling. He's no longer with us. That's sad. But he gave great TED Talks, really data-heavy TED Talks because they often hear from product people, yeah, but the work we do that's so boring, how could we make a great story out of that? And I think Hans Rosling showed over and over again that you can. So that definitely is an inspiration.

Petra Wille (00:47:14):
And then on a totally different note, I love spoken word poetry because it really talks to the heart and minds of people. And in my coaching, I usually send people off to the TED Talk from Sarah Kay, which has the nice title, If I Should Have a Daughter. And that really helps people to understand, "Ah, okay, that's how you could be playful with words." And that's what happens to me personally and to my body and to my emotions if I listen to something like that. So that's maybe three things I could be mentioning.

Lenny (00:47:49):
Hans Rosling's the guy with the world poverty charts and ...

Petra Wille (00:47:54):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:47:54):
Yeah, yeah.

Petra Wille (00:47:57):
On world and data.

Lenny (00:47:57):
Right.

Petra Wille (00:47:57):
Now, his son is, I think, in charge, but, yeah.

Lenny (00:48:00):
Cool. I'm excited. I'm going to watch that one again. That's a good reminder. Maybe just another question around storytelling. Say you're a PM and you're about to start a document or a deck and you just want it to be a good story, what are two or three things you should just do to set yourself up for success?

Petra Wille (00:48:17):
Yeah. First of all, don't sit in front of the blank page for too long, just start drafting something. I think there's a lot of beauty in story as a design tool, so to say, because it's even easier to change a story than it is to change a prototype, right? So even before you put something in writing, you could start talking about it and see how it lands and then tweak it. And I think that's the first thing, get going.

Petra Wille (00:48:43):
And then the other thing is go start talking about your story, go test it, see how it resonates, and then tweak it. And maybe you could use one of the proven story structures, find the one that helps you most. Really, even if it's super boring, but I'll use this hero's journey a lot where I think about, should I put the team in the heart of the story? Because if it's a story that should help me to motivate the team or to inspire the team to actions or something like that, then maybe it's nice if I put them in the center of the story and make them the heroes and talk about the demons and monsters they have to fight to once arrived at this brighter future.

Petra Wille (00:49:25):
And maybe some other times, it makes sense to put the user there and really talk about how their world and lives would have improved once this product is out and available. Or maybe it's even a feature that we're talking about or a bigger redesign or whatever you're currently working on, right? But you could use this proven story structure and see what are the things in there. So the call to adventure, what is the call to adventure? What is this bright future? And it helps you to start and to get going.

Petra Wille (00:49:55):
And then I usually advise people to have the story handy in various formats. So spoken that you could actually talk about it. Written, because we all tend to work in remote or asynchronous environment. So just a recorded video maybe. Yeah, it's good, but maybe a written version of it is nice as well. And the next one is an illustration that helps you making some of the core points of your story visible to the audience. And that could be a whiteboard drawing, a flipchart drawing. It could be a bigger, maybe it's five slides with emotional pictures on it or whatever it is, but be visual with your story as well.

Petra Wille (00:50:37):
And then you should have it ready in three different formats in a super short 75-second elevator pitch version. In the six minutes, I can do this before we actually start planning version. And ideally, I have to go to the company all-hands and have to talk about what we will look into for the next four months. And that's maybe an 80 minutes version. And 80 minutes is the length of an average TED Talk, and there is a reason for that. It has to do with attention spans and all these kind of things. So that's why I advise people to use this three length.

Lenny (00:51:14):
An example you're using there is a PM designing the vision for their team potentially or their strategy for the next, say, six months, right?

Petra Wille (00:51:21):
Yeah, exactly. So we don't need to create this complicated story for the next sprint, I'd say. That's too much of an effort, maybe waste of time. You need to look a bit further out to make it worth spending a lot of time on creating your story.

Lenny (00:51:38):
If you had to pick one book or resource that helped you become a better storyteller or that you found other people coming back to that helps them level up their storytelling skills, what comes to mind? I'll share one first as you think about that. There's a recent book that you wouldn't think would be good at this, but it is really good at helping understand how to tell a story. And it's called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit. And it's by ... Yeah. And the title alone is a great lesson, which is, nobody wants to read your stuff. Yeah. But the premise of the book is how to make it so that people find it interesting and useful. It's by Steven Pressfield who wrote The War of Art and Bagger Vance and all these things. So it's one of his new books, I think. So that's what comes to mind.

Petra Wille (00:52:22):
That's pretty cool.

Lenny (00:52:22):
What comes to mind.

Petra Wille (00:52:23):
Back in the day when Marty Cagan was my product coach, he made me read Selling the Dream, which is the Macintosh story on product evangelizing by Guy Kawasaki. And it didn't help me to become a better storytelling, but it helped me realize that it's really important that I work on that skill. So that is actually the trigger and material that helped me is basically everything from Nancy Duarte and Duarte Inc. So there are even leadership books about rituals and how to ignite the spark in all the people you're having. So they're talking a lot about the leadership aspect of storytelling, but they have something for the IC level as well, 72 rules on storytelling and all these kind of things. And I have a lot of free material. I know it's not a book, but they have several books and that was great material that helped me to become better.

Lenny (00:53:16):
Man, the show notes on this episode are going to be out of control. It's going to hit some limit for [inaudible 00:53:20].

Petra Wille (00:53:20):
Yeah, maybe we're ... Yeah, the longest show notes ever. Sorry.

Lenny (00:53:24):
Oh my God. Yeah, it's going to be rough. I'm actually going to try to get Nancy Duarte in this podcast.

Petra Wille (00:53:29):
Ooh, yeah.

Lenny (00:53:30):
So that's a good ... That's-

Petra Wille (00:53:31):
Say hi if you do. Yeah, I'm a fan.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Okay, I'll do that. I'll do that. Okay. So getting to our final topic, which is around community. You're a big fan of finding community and just the power of being in a community, and I know you've done a bunch of research there, you're just like pumping your fist as we talk about this. I love it. So tell us why you're such a big fan of the power of community for product managers in general.

Petra Wille (00:53:54):
Again, the starting point was a rather egocentric starting point because I'm constantly thinking about, how could I scale the work that I do because I still see so many companies not getting a product coach or I still see so many companies where people development is not a priority, all these kind of things. And at some point, I thought, if the line manager is not taking care of the personal development, who could? And I talked to several of my colleagues about the question and, at some point, somebody said, "Yeah, that's what community of practices are often used for." So that's where a lot of people get their inspiration. And basically, I reflected on my career. And early on, I was in a super engaging product organization where, really, we tried a lot, we shared a lot. A lot of the things that we tried didn't work at all, but others really fell on fertile grounds and we could learn from each other.

Petra Wille (00:54:55):
And we invested quite some time in this sharing, but everyone got better over time because of this community being present. And so I decided to make this my topic for this year's research, so to say. And I was talking to a lot of my clients and former clients, "Hey, are you running a community of practice? If you don't run a community of practice, why is that?" Often, they have never considered running one, they don't know where to start. So that's another problem, obviously. And at some point, I decided to conduct a survey to see if random strangers can tell me about their companies and their community of practice. And it was super interesting as well.

Petra Wille (00:55:34):
For example, I found that oftentimes there is a bit of a community of practice internally, but they never heard about external product community. So they never heard of your community or to raise this community or mind the product or any of those external communities. And that is shocking to an extent as well because we're all so friendly human beings, happy to share what we learn, and they don't have to go through the same things over and over again. So that's why I think it's a super important question and I would love to help a bit more companies to start a community of practice or to mature the community of practice that they're already having.

Lenny (00:56:14):
What impact have you seen folks get when they join or find a great community? And then what are communities that you find are most useful? You mentioned ... And I want to get your advice on what I could do to make it even better, but maybe those two questions. What impact do you find when you find a great community and then what are some that you [inaudible 00:56:31]?

Petra Wille (00:56:31):
One impact, definitely, is stickiness. So people tend to stay with companies where they're learning and growing and can, yeah, get to mastery, so to say. Hello, Daniel Pink. So that is really something that people are thriving for, and if they find this in a company and a product community of practice could be a big part of that. So that is one impact.

Petra Wille (00:56:59):
Then the other impact, there's less people development on the desk of the product lead if there is a good product community of practice. So product leads, your life will get so much easier if there is a product community of practice. And it's actually a pretty cheap way of doing people development because trainings are expensive, conference tickets are expensive, getting external product coach, expensive. But helping people to learn from each other by making room for that and giving them a bit of time to reflect and to share what they're learning, that's rather cheap. So I think that is the benefits that I see.

Petra Wille (00:57:40):
Training budget impact. People tend to stay with the company a bit longer. Leadership wise, it's less a time that you have to invest in people development. And then it's just fun for a lot of people. That's another uptake, I'd say.

Lenny (00:57:54):
What are signs that the community that you're in, say, you found?You mentioned a bunch that I think are awesome. Teresa's community, we'll talk about my Slack a little bit. Mind the Product.

Petra Wille (00:58:02):
Yes.

Lenny (00:58:03):
What are signs that the community you're in is good with your time? Something you should stick with versus like, "Nah, get out of there."

Petra Wille (00:58:10):
That is actually a good question. So I would say, if it helps you with networking, that is really something good if you meet nice, interesting people. So that is one thing I would love to mention. And then if you're learning something new every now and then, maybe not every day, maybe not every week, but every now and then, there should be some real nuggets where you think, "Oh, this is making my life easier," or "This is super interesting. I would never ever have stumbled upon this thing without the community." So learning something new and then reflecting on how much you already learned about a certain topic or know about a certain topic, which is contributing to the community.

Petra Wille (00:58:55):
You could be a community moderator, you could be somebody organizing some of the rituals, you could be somebody just sharing what you learned. So I think that is something that could be in a good community that is possible at least to share that everybody's sharing and that there's mutual trust and then it's often just, if you enjoy being part of this community. That's, I think, another super important thing to look into. Do you like the people there? Do you like to hang out with them? Do you think they're kind, lovely human beings? And is there some level of activity in the community because there's too many dead ones out there, more or less? And I think these are the things that I, yeah, would use as a benchmark.

Lenny (00:59:37):
When you're talking about this, initially, I was just imagining online communities, but there's also, obviously, offline communities probably somewhere in your local city.

Petra Wille (00:59:44):
Yeah, product things.

Lenny (00:59:44):
Right. Just like ... Yeah.

Petra Wille (00:59:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:46):
Yeah. So I think ... I don't know if people thought that when I was talking, but, yeah, there's probably meetups happening in your city with product managers that are meeting each other every week, every month maybe.

Petra Wille (00:59:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:56):
That sounds awesome. And I love your point about the why of the community versus a course versus reading lots of books. It's really affordable to join some product community, especially if it's online.

Petra Wille (01:00:09):
Yes.

Lenny (01:00:10):
And the ROI could be really high.

Petra Wille (01:00:11):
Yeah. And it brings so much clarity in your thinking if you're sharing some things you learned with the community that this is a massive uptake as well, so give back. That really makes sense for you personally as well.

Lenny (01:00:27):
So you mentioned my Slack community. So if folks don't know this and they're listening, basically, if you're a paid subscriber committees letter, you get access to the Slack and there's about 10,000 people in there, mostly PMs and founders and growth leaders, and it's pretty damn incredible. It's probably the thing I'm most proud of of all the things I've done over the last few years around this newsletter and podcast.

Lenny (01:00:48):
And so if you're not in there, you should definitely check it out. It's thriving. There's meetups happening all over the world every month. There's a mentorship program, there's mastermind groups, all kinds of stuff. And you're familiar with it. And so I just wanted to ask you while I have you here, do you have any advice for how to make this community even more great?

Petra Wille (01:01:06):
That is not an easy question. First of all, congratulations. I really think it's a massive achievement to start such a community and to really have such a vibrant community because I know it takes a lot of energy investment at first to get it going and then a lot of energy to keep it on a certain level, so to say.

Petra Wille (01:01:29):
Yeah. What I found helpful is I have this community canvas that I use when I'm working with clients and some of these things require workshops to some extent. So it helps to reflect on what is the purpose of the community and that changes over time with the community members that are currently part of this community, right? So that is not a stable thing. So sometimes everybody has to pause for a second and then think about what is the purpose of this community, what are our values, and how will we define success?

Petra Wille (01:02:05):
It's pretty boring, I know, because it sounds so, so familiar with what we do in product management, but I think it applies for product communities as well. And then you need to find good rituals and rhythm, and you, Lenny, were already talking about some of the ones you are using. I know, for example, what Teresa is doing in her community. I interviewed her this year, so there is a blog post on that online as well where she talks about what she tried, and what did work, and what did not work. So I think that is important.

Petra Wille (01:02:36):
Then maybe not so important for your community. Well, let's see. Let's discuss, let me hear what you think, which is incentives and sponsoring. So how do you, yeah, value contribution? Are you giving back? Is it a kudos mechanism or is it something where people really earn badges of honor or earn time, earn more training budget. That's what a lot of companies do, right? If you're playing an active role in the community, then you get more training budget to spend or something like that, or they grant you time to do so. So if you say like, "Hey, I want to be part of this product community, could I travel a quarter or something like that because I want to go and see those people?" That is something that people do. So incentives and sponsoring, then it's roles. And that will be interesting in your case as well. Is Lenny the center of the community?

Lenny (01:03:34):
Yeah, I try really hard not to do that, actually.

Petra Wille (01:03:36):
Yeah, right. Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:36):
That's a [inaudible 01:03:36] try to not be the beacon of all answers. The actual goal of the community was I will not have all the answers. Let's just bring a bunch of smart people together that are already there's this interesting filter of who pays for content about product and growth and stuff.

Petra Wille (01:03:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:53):
Filter's really interesting. So the whole idea was get out of the middle of this thing and let people help each other and it's worked out really well.

Petra Wille (01:03:59):
Yeah, because that's what I would say after doing all this research, it's not sustainable if the whole community is on the shoulders of one, two, three people. So you need to distribute the workload and you need to distribute this responsibility because sometimes even things like, yeah, policing the community is not a pleasant job. And if there's only one person dealing with all of these things, then it's not really community because then it's a bit organized like a company in this pyramid scheme.

Petra Wille (01:04:30):
So I think more of it as circles, different circles of interest, and then building bridges between them because maybe not everybody in your community is interested in the same topics, but maybe they are the smaller circles of 10, 15 people interested in this one topic, 10, 15 people interested in this other topic. You may be connecting the dots, you may be giving a bit of impulse and inspiration, but maybe other people are doing the exact same thing, sharing their best reads and their worthy to watch videos, and all these kind of things. So content and curation, definitely, is another thing that you should think about and reflect on once in a while.

Lenny (01:05:08):
Cool. Thanks for the advice. Curious is so important. Especially early on, I found keeping the signal to noise high always. And especially early on, it was a really prayerful. So there's a lot of focus [inaudible 01:05:19] detail oriented about it all.

Petra Wille (01:05:21):
Yeah. Plus, a lot of communities that I see use engagement as a success metric, and I'm actually not sure if this is a good success metric. So as you say, signal versus noise is maybe the better success metric, which leads us the down the rabbit hole of how to [inaudible 01:05:38]. But, yeah, engagement is maybe not the predominant success factor for a community.

Lenny (01:05:44):
Yeah, that's interesting. You also said it's a lot of work. And just to give some shout-outs to folks that help me run this community that we have, I couldn't do this without them. Trey, who leads the community. Keani who-

Petra Wille (01:05:54):
Hello, Trey.

Lenny (01:05:55):
Hello, Trey.

Petra Wille (01:05:56):
I know Keani.

Lenny (01:05:58):
Keani curates the best conversations in the Slack every week and then shares them in this bonus email, Community Wisdom.

Petra Wille (01:06:04):
Nice.

Lenny (01:06:04):
And then Ria, who's been helping out run the meetup program. And then Jess who's helping with our mentorship program and a few other things. So that's the core team that helps this whole thing run. Thank you to them all.

Petra Wille (01:06:15):
Thank you. And it's super interesting that you're sharing that because companies often don't want to invest in, yeah, full-time community manager is maybe the wrong word because that not necessarily has to be a full-time role, but there need to be some people that really have a decent amount of time to invest in running this community because otherwise it's not working. And I still think it is still cheaper than sending everybody to trainings and conferences all the time, and it has a lot of, yeah, ripple effects and network effects.

Lenny (01:06:48):
Well, guess what, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Petra Wille (01:06:51):
[inaudible 01:06:52].

Lenny (01:06:52):
So I'm going to ask you a few questions. Whatever comes to mind, let me know. We'll go through it pretty fast.

Petra Wille (01:06:57):
Yes.

Lenny (01:06:57):
And are you ready?

Petra Wille (01:06:58):
I'm so ready.

Lenny (01:06:59):
So ready. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Petra Wille (01:07:05):
The Art of Thinking Clearly by Dobelli. It talks about human biases in a really nice and illustrated way. Then what I use a lot in my coaching practice, especially with senior executive, is Outcomes Over Output because it's a super strong concept, I'd say. And then maybe I want to mention two books that are not yet written, but two concepts that I hope will make it into books, and one is Martin Eriksson's Decision Stack. And then there is another book about public speaking that hopefully might come out if some people are supporting it on Kickstarter. And that is called Present Yourself, a public speaking book.

Lenny (01:07:42):
Awesome. If you can sign a link to that, we'll include it also in the show notes.

Petra Wille (01:07:45):
Of course.

Lenny (01:07:46):
The record ...

Petra Wille (01:07:47):
Show notes, hello.

Lenny (01:07:48):
... longest-ever show notes. Speaking of that, what's another podcast that you love?

Petra Wille (01:07:52):
I love the Product Experience podcast. And if you're able to speak German, then there is one that is called [foreign language 01:07:58]. That's a nice interview series.

Lenny (01:08:02):
[foreign language 01:08:02], I like that. I do not speak German, but I thought it'd be fun to listen to, anyway. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've enjoyed?

Petra Wille (01:08:11):
Maybe New Amsterdam. I loved it. That's actually a medical director, Matt, and he's finding very unconventional ways to solve problems and I think he's a great leader, so maybe that's a nice framing for watching the show.

Lenny (01:08:26):
What was it called? New Amsterdam?

Petra Wille (01:08:27):
New Amsterdam.

Lenny (01:08:28):
Sweet. What's a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're interviewing folks?

Petra Wille (01:08:32):
Definitely the tell me about the last time. So tell me about a time when you did your last round of user interviews. Tell me about your last time when you onboarded a new colleague because I think as a user interviewing this, tell me about the last time you really, yeah, sparks nice conversations and interviews.

Lenny (01:08:54):
What are five SaaS tools or products that help you do the work that you do now? And if there aren't enough of those, just great apps that you love right now.

Petra Wille (01:09:04):
I'm totally not into product management SaaS tool these days because as I'm just coaching people on hourly basis, I'm no longer the one looking into the SaaS tools they're using. So that's quite a tough question. Things that I use a lot in my personal work is rather boring stuff like bookkeeping software and time tracking [inaudible 01:09:25]-

Lenny (01:09:24):
Which ones? That's interesting.

Petra Wille (01:09:27):
Harvest is what I use for time tracking and bookkeeping, and I love that. It makes my life easier since a few years already. And then, yeah, new banking apps that are coming up that I'm using for my accounts. One is Qonto, I think it's a German bank, but they really did a great job in the user experience, super seamless in the apps and all these kind of things. Yeah. So that's two cool products that I love to use.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Great. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader, influencer-type person?

Petra Wille (01:10:01):
As I'm a conference organizer as well for a conference that was called the Product Engage here in Hamburg, that is the super hard question for me to ask because so many people have been on that stage, that I would consider being a thought leader, they would maybe not consider them being a thought leader. I think the thought leader thing is pretty hard anyway, so there's so many different voices in our industry. And I think looking at the guest list of your podcast actually is a very good start when you think about thought leaders and getting more inspirations because they are ones that we know and some hidden gems on there.

Lenny (01:10:37):
Great answer. Great answer. Petra, thank you so much for doing this. We've hit the record on show note length, I guess, so that's a milestone. Congrats.

Petra Wille (01:10:48):
Yes, thank you. Was a pleasure.

Lenny (01:10:51):
Two final questions. Where can folks finding online if they want to learn more, reach out, maybe work with you and how can listeners be useful to you?

Petra Wille (01:10:58):
Ooh, interesting. Yeah, the first one is easy, LinkedIn, Petra Wille, you can find me there. And then there is my website, Petra-W-I-L-L-E.com. That's my website. And how can listeners be helpful to me? Whew, that's a tough one. I think it could be mutual beneficial if you are a product manager IC level and you would love to get better supported in your personal development and go by my book and just hand it to your manager, if that's appropriate. Or just put it on their desk and just forget that it's there and hopefully they read it or something like that. I think that is how I would love to answer the last question.

Lenny (01:11:40):
Remind folks what the book is called and they can find on Amazon [inaudible 01:11:43].

Petra Wille (01:11:42):
Strong Product People.

Lenny (01:11:46):
Strong Product People. Go check it out on Amazon.

Petra Wille (01:11:48):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:11:48):
Petra, thank you so much for doing this.

Petra Wille (01:11:50):
Lenny, was a pleasure.

Lenny (01:11:52):
It's my pleasure.

# Land your dream job in today’s market: negotiation tactics, job search councils, more | Phyl Terry

## Transcript

Phyl Terry (00:00:00):
When you're looking for a job, you need a spear and not a net. What happens when we're building a product? Same thing, right? We want this product to be for everyone, but we've learned with product market fit that doesn't work. We need a narrow, clear focus.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
How did you realize this is a really powerful method versus the way people normally look for jobs?

Phyl Terry (00:00:16):
While it's hard to figure out your candidate market fit, it's also a relief to know it's not about you. So what I ask people to do is I ask them to think about what they want and what they don't want. Now, you might not think that that's a radical step, Lenny, but most people don't do that. When they get laid off, they spray and pray.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
This is very much like a product person thinks about new product.

Phyl Terry (00:00:34):
There's no I in team. Well, there is an I in village, and the I in village is that when you start to interview and negotiate, you've got to be in charge. I want you to play to win, not not to lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Is there anything else that you think might be helpful to people looking for jobs?

Phyl Terry (00:00:49):
If someone did this, it would blow my mind. I would hire them on the spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Phyl Terry. Phyl is the author of Never Search Alone, which I've seen so many people reference as the most impactful thing they read for helping them find a job. Once you listen to this episode, you'll see why.

(00:01:09):
Prior to this book, Phyl was on the founding team of the first company that Amazon acquired back in the '90s, and then was CEO of the pioneering product and customer experience consulting firm Creative Good for over 15 years, where Phyl and the team had companies like Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and hundreds of other companies as customers. Phyl also co-authored Customers Included, has written articles for the Harvard Business Review, and has delivered more than 500 keynotes to companies like Apple and Microsoft. This episode is for anyone struggling to find a job or unhappy in the job that they're in. I promise you, the time you put into listening to this episode will help you find a job that you love.

(00:01:47):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Phyl Terry. Phyl, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Phyl Terry (00:02:05):
Oh, what a pleasure. I'm such a fan of yours, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):
I'm thrilled to be here.

Phyl Terry (00:02:09):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:10):
I'm a huge fan of yours, and I think by the end of this I'll be an even bigger fan of yours. What I'm hoping that we can do in our chat today is to help people who are struggling to find a job and especially struggling to find a job they love, actually find that job with actual tips that they can use today in this week. How does that feel to you?

Phyl Terry (00:02:29):
That's great. We have some practical time-tested stuff that I've developed over the last 25 years with leaders in Silicon Valley, especially in the product community. We've really brought a product lens to reinventing the job search, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:41):
This is a perfect Venn diagram of topics then.

Phyl Terry (00:02:43):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:45):
There's a lot of ways I can approach this. I want to start with a question about something that you run, something that you created, something that has had a lot of impact on a lot of people: Job Search Councils. What is a Job Search Council?

Phyl Terry (00:02:56):
It's a support group of six to eight job seekers, so product people, but it is not just for product people, but the product community really owns this, it comes out of the product community. And what they do is they commit to being with each other, to supporting each other, go through the process of looking for a job and I lay out a methodology, how to figure out your candidate market fit, one of the big concepts in the book. As well as how to play to win, not not to lose. You know what I mean? People are scared in the job search. Here's the thing, Lenny, that people really have a hard time believing, everyone, I mean everyone, and I work with some of the most senior people in Silicon Valley, I'm talking about CEOs of public companies, I'm talking about chief product officers, VPs of product at great brands, everyone, no matter who they are, Lenny, feels insecure and anxious in the job search. And if you do it alone, it magnifies that.

(00:03:57):
So with Job Search Councils, there's this great hack, I didn't invent this, it's baked into human psychology, if you put anxious people together and ask them to be open and vulnerable and to ask for help, and we'll come back to asking for help, it actually flips the anxiety and the fear into hope, into motivation, into accountability and confidence. It's like, "What [inaudible 00:04:20]?" It's fantastic. My mother taught me this, we can talk about her at some point, but it's really powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:28):
That's amazing. Your whole book is called Never Search Alone, so the whole premise of how you recommend people look for jobs is to look for jobs with other people. You mentioned maybe it's your mom, maybe it's something else, how did you realize this is a really powerful method versus the way people normally look for jobs?

Phyl Terry (00:04:44):
Yeah. I set up my first council more than four years ago. I set up the first CEO council for internet CEOs in the mid '90s, and then I've run product and CEO council since. But it goes all the way back to my mom. 1960, Lenny, 1960, what is that? 64 years ago? In the San Fernando Valley, my mom was a newly-minted elementary school teacher, and she put together a council of teachers. That group met for 50 years, 5-0, until the year she died. They worked together to ask for help and support each other in their careers. And Lenny, people say to me, "Does this Never Search Alone method work in a tough job market?" And I'll tell you, it comes out of tough job markets. Absolutely, yes. Starting with my mom.

(00:05:39):
So in 1974, my dad... in 1976 he left and it was just me and my mom and my sister. He had insisted that she stop teaching, so she lost her tenure and everything. Her candidate market fit was terrible, but she had her council. It was the mid '70s, and Lenny, you probably can't imagine how hard it was for a single middle-aged woman with kids looking for a job in Los Angeles in the mid '70s. It was terrible. But she had her support group and they held her hand. The job she could get, guess what? She had to be an entry level teacher again after having been a senior teacher coaching and advising. It was really tough. So that had a big impact on me.

(00:06:22):
And then when the dotcom bubble burst, I was running Creative Good, and suddenly there was a depression. And suddenly I'm helping hundreds of people try to figure out their job search. So it's been going for a number of years, but it goes back to my mom. I dedicate the book to her and the community we've built.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:40):
That's beautiful.

(00:06:42):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut-check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This gives you more than a leg up, it gives you a leap forward. Having a group of trusted and amazing peers was key to my career growth, and this is the Sidebar ethos.

(00:07:08):
But it's hard to build this trusted group of peers on your own. Sidebar is a platform for senior tech professionals, director to C-level, to advance in their career. Members are matched into peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation all running on Sidebar's technology, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're listening to this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Check them out at sidebar.com/lenny.

(00:07:52):

(00:08:55):
There's a lot of elements that you mentioned that we're going to dig into, so job candidate fit, playing to win. You touched a little bit this idea of settling, figuring out what to settle for. Your mom took a job that's below what she was doing before, so I want to chat about all these things. A little bit more on these councils. What's the scale of these? So I think it's going to blow people's mind just how many of these are happening and [inaudible 00:09:16]-

Phyl Terry (00:09:15):
We have launched more than 2,000 of these Lenny, 2,000, and they're completely free, completely 100% free. It's volunteer-driven. We have hundreds of pages of tools. We've done a Slack community. We have a free matching program. You can sign up and we'll match you and put you in a council. Then we'll give you training, live training. There's so many volunteers. We have 20,000 hours of volunteer work that's already been put into this, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
You said that it's free. I know these things aren't free to run.

Phyl Terry (00:09:46):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):
I saw somewhere that you mentioned that basically all your book sales and also just your own money you spend on running these councils. Talk about that for a little bit.

Phyl Terry (00:09:55):
Yeah, actually two times the book sales are going into running this. So we have 20,000 hours of volunteer time, but you also have to pay for technology and you have to pay for certain kinds of support. Later we will talk about this, and we're always looking for more volunteers. I have a process for people to apply if they're interested in being a part of the team. But yeah, I have dedicated this to my mom, and I'm giving everything to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:25):
What's the general structure? If someone's trying to think about how these things work, if they want to join these as we go through it, how do they work?

Phyl Terry (00:10:31):
Okay, so you apply at phyl.org, P-H-Y-L, Phyl with a Y. Again, it's free. We match you behind the scenes. Now, when you apply, we ask, "First of all, are you in a job and looking or are you out of work?" Because we separate those two because they have different cadences. If you're in a job and looking, we call you a slow seeker because you have a full-time job and you can't work as quickly. If you're out of work and looking, we call you a fast seeker and we put you in different groups. Fast seeker or slow seeker. We also ask though, are you willing to be a moderator? Every council needs a moderator, and every moderator is a job seeker who volunteers to do that. If you volunteer to moderate, first of all, you get matched faster, and secondly, you get more training and support.

(00:11:18):
It's a little bit more work for a lot more benefit. We've gotten 2,000 moderators, Lenny, it's amazing. And we feel like we're just beginning. So you apply, you get matched, and then you go through an orientation program that we run live where we tell you how this works and what to expect in your first meeting. And then there's a whole set of agendas and materials and everything in the book as well as everyone gets a free workbook, a 100-page workbook after they join the community with all of the templates and guides and questions. And then the moderator pulls you together, you work on Zoom or whatever technology, it's remote typically. And you do a first meeting, we call it meeting zero, where you're open and vulnerable. People share stories about their lives and who they are, builds trust and get a sense of who people are. And then you move into the process. You meet twice a week typically if you're in a fast seeker council and every two weeks if you're in a slow seeker. So that's the start of the answer. Does that help you think?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
Yeah, really helpful. And then you basically are on this council until you find a job, I imagine.

Phyl Terry (00:12:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:27):
Awesome.

Phyl Terry (00:12:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:28):
Is there anything you can share around the impact you've seen? The reason I reached out to you to come on this podcast is I just started seeing people mentioning that they found a job and maybe the thing that helped them most was your book and being on one of these councils. I imagine there's a lot of stories you hear and a lot of numbers you could see of just people succeeding going through, so what can you share about just the impact you've seen?

Phyl Terry (00:12:51):
Well, I posted on LinkedIn today that I was going to be on your podcast and I asked people if they wanted to share stories with me, and over email and LinkedIn, I've been flooded with stories from people who are in the process or people who did it. If you like, I can pull up and share a few of those if that would be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):
Yeah, if there's a few you have there, that'd be really sweet.

Phyl Terry (00:13:12):
Okay, so Justin Meats is a chief product officer who's gone through the process and he posted on LinkedIn today. He said, "As a product leader, I love how it has you apply the product process to your career." This comes out of the product world, it's a product lens on the job search, and it's for everyone, but it really makes sense for product people. And he says, "Not only does your JSC help bounce ideas and help your job search, they also help you keep going and accountable when you're low on emotional energy."

(00:13:46):
I talk about this in the book, Lenny, I say, "Look, most people think, 'What's the most important thing to manage during your job search?'" They think, well, maybe it's their resume or LinkedIn profile or their ability to network or candidate market fit, a concept I introduced I think is really important. All those things are really important, but the most important thing to manage is your emotional balance. I talk about your emotional balance sheet. And for many job seekers, they have more liabilities than assets on their old balance sheets. They have more fear and anxiety, they feel demoralized, they have a hard time going. That's why these things are so important.

(00:14:24):
He also says, "Hey, it's a journey, and the more you embrace it, the more you learn about yourself." And he says... and this is important Lenny. I don't have a magic wand that especially in a down market today that magically gets a job. It's hard. The job search, it can be hard and humiliating at times. I know. This is why I want to create this community, why we're doing this. We want to give you a place where you can really get the support when it's hard and humiliating. But the process will ultimately set you up for success if you follow it.

(00:14:58):
This one woman who just started, she's a senior product leader in a major financial institution, and she said she couldn't believe the level of support and openness and vulnerability. We really emphasize people being open and vulnerable, and I've learned a lot about how to create that environment. It ties back to asking for help, which I know we'll talk about more at some point. But when you create that, it's amazing what people can do together, Lenny. Amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):
Just to reinforce this point, people listening may be like, "I'm just going to keep looking for a job. I'll use all this advice. I don't need a group." What's your best pitch, again, to help people see the value of doing this in a group and joining a council or starting a council?

Phyl Terry (00:15:45):
I acknowledge that that's a reaction that some people have. That's totally valid. This is unusual, what we're doing here. This is not how people look for a job. We're trying to disrupt the job search process. Lenny, this is my quick story. We had a great interview with a couple. Two of them were product leaders. They had met at Amazon and then had gone to have great careers. They both got laid off. The woman joined a Job Search Council right away. She loved it, she raved about it. Her husband, who was also an engineer, was a little more introverted. He's like, "Ah, this isn't for me." She said, "No, listen, you won't... " And finally he read the book. Because the book, it works for the product mind and for the engineering mind, it makes sense. He said, "I'll join a council, but I'm not going to be field connected to people. But I'll do this because you asked me to."

(00:16:43):
He sat in the interview, we have it up on the side, he was like, "Oh my God, I couldn't believe it. The level of trust we created right off the bat I've never experienced in my life. It's really truly accountability, the motivation, the ability to hang in there." And so I say to people, " Look, try it." We have all these videos on our website with all these people talking. Go look at it. If you want to read the book first and see if you think this makes sense. But try it. You will be shocked in a positive way. You'll discover how delightful it is.

(00:17:25):
We live in a world where there's increasing loneliness, Lenny. There's so much research about this, the Surgeon General's book, everybody talking about... And it's more detrimental to our health than smoking cigarettes. Bowling Alone famously came out 25 years ago. We live in a world where people have not experienced community in a powerful way. I don't mean message boards, I mean real community. And I think you have a sense of this because you do real community. And that's what we're talking about here. It's real community but with some practical tools and techniques, which we'll talk about. What do you think? Is that a good response to the-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:08):
I'm sold. I don't need a job, but I want to join one. You also just had a really beautiful way of describing these programs as a safety net for people.

Phyl Terry (00:18:16):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):
Does that ring a bell?

Phyl Terry (00:18:18):
If we go up to the 30,000-foot level, what are we doing here? What's our mission? We're building a private safety net for all those who've been laid off or let go. Look, we're not going to do what the government does with unemployment insurance, we're never going to be able to do something like that. But the government's never going to be able to innovate around how to actually look for a job. That's where we come in. We are trying to build this. We talked about this earlier, Lenny, creative destruction is this economic concept that sits at the heart of capitalism. Creative destruction basically says, "Under capitalism, it's dynamic. New products and services displace or disrupt old products and services, companies and methods." It's why our economy has grown sixfold over the last a hundred years. It's remarkable. It's why we have this amazing multi-trillion dollar economy. But it comes with some negative unintended consequences, which is that people both in jobs and out of jobs, they're anxious and fearful. There's no program that addresses that.

(00:19:20):
That's what we're going after here. We're trying to be the solve for the unintended consequences of the thing that is so positive in many ways and that we as product people love because we get to build new products and displace old products. I'll just say one more thing. The reason you know this creative destruction works so well is if you compare our economy to the late Soviet Union's economy. They were a planned economy with no creative destruction. So there was no innovation, and eventually it just failed. It just collapsed. It's remarkable, this is a huge country with a massive military and nuclear weapons, but they couldn't make their economy work. Why? Because they didn't have this element. So it's something to celebrate, but as we celebrate it, we need to have something that addresses the negative unintended consequences. All of us who benefited from this, I think it's our duty to do something about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
That is beautiful. You're very good at this. Let's shift to talking about tactics. Let's talk about some of the things that you've shared. So you've mentioned things like candidate market fit, playing to win. Go wherever you want to go. Let's pick a few and then dive in.

Phyl Terry (00:20:29):
Candidate market fit is probably the most important job search tactic in the book, aside from the Job Search Council, and it may be the thing I'm known for. When I die, they coin candidate market fit. So here's the thing, and this is why this is so important in a down market, when you're looking for a job, you're in a marketplace with supply and demand characteristics. So if there's a lot of supply, which there is right now in the tech world because there's been a lot of layoffs, the overall economy, there's been net job additions, Lenny, but those have been primarily in healthcare and government. There've been net job losses in tech. We could talk about why that is, but that's the world that we're in.

(00:21:17):
So let's say you're a director of product. Two years ago when the economy was great in tech and the job market was great in tech, you could probably get a VP of product role. What about today? Well, today your candidate market fit's been pushed down because there's a bunch of VPs of products who are going to take a director role. Guess what? That means you might not be able to get the director role you might need to get a senior manager role or whatever. Now, the important thing about this is it's not a personal segment about you. It's the marketplace. And that's what so many people today in their notes to me said, that it was such a relief for them. While it's hard to figure out your candidate market fit, it's also a relief to know it's not about you.

(00:21:59):
So what I ask people to do is the first radical step I ask them to take is to think about what they want and what they don't want. Now, you might not think that that's a radical step, Lenny, but most people don't do that. When they get laid off, they spray and pray. That's the typical, "Let me just... " Wait a minute, just take a moment. They're like, "Oh, don't slow me down." I'm like, "I'm going to slow you down to go fast." In fact, what our data shows is that the average job search in the Job Search Council from beginning to end is three months. If you look at the national data for job search, it's three to six months. So we are at the very low end of the national average. So this is not a slow down, take two years, whatever. No, no. Most people need to put food on the plate, so it's a slow down at first. And we as product people should understand this. You want to think about your strategy. You want to understand the marketplace, your customer, the product market fit. You're not going to just go...

(00:22:59):
You're going to iterate. First step, what do you want and what don't you want? That's the Mnookin two-pager named after Allison Mnookin, who was a member of one of our product councils. So we run product councils and general management CEO councils for people in jobs. That's a paid program that companies pay for. It's out of that program helping those people that I developed this methodology that we're now as a community giving to the world. So Allison, she was the GM at Intuit, and then she spun out a division and ran it as CEO, and she's now a professor at the Harvard Business School. And about 15 years ago, she was in transition and we talked and she created and we created this thing we called now the Mnookin two-pager. I told her, "Allison, I'm going to make your name famous." That's my job. I love her.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:46):
Great name.

Phyl Terry (00:23:46):
She's wonderful. And it's just a simple thing, what do you, what don't you like and you create it and then you share it in your council. And here's something cool, Lenny. Let's say you and I are in a Job Search Council. You share yours, I share your mine. Now you see a few things about what you don't like. I'm like, "Hot damn, I also don't like those. I forgot, I got to add that." Or you say a thing about what you like, you're like, "Oh, wow, no, that's really important to me, and I left that out." So that's part of the shared learning environment. I'm asking you to do these, but with others who you're walking it through.

(00:24:16):
Now, once you have done that Mnookin two-pager, and it's a draft, you don't have to get it fine, and not everyone knows exactly what they want, by the way, this is important, especially younger people. But sometimes mid-career people too, they're like, "Oh, I'm not... " So I'm not asking you to make a final decision, no, no. We're going to iterate. Okay, we're product people, we're going to iterate.

(00:24:38):
So we're going to take this Mnookin two-pager, this draft that shared with our council, and we're going to go out and do a listening tour. Because guess what? In the job search, we're the product. We're our skills and experience. That's the product that we're bringing to market. So we have to go see what the market wants. Now we have a sense of what we want, but what does the market want and what does some of our trusted friends, what do they think about what I want and what I'm a fit for? And what do they think I'm a fit for now given the market conditions that we have?

(00:25:09):
I will tell you, people are terrified to do the listening tour. They're like, "I don't know, what am I going to hear from people?" Because I asked them to ask a golden question, if you were in my shoes, how would you approach this? I call that the golden question. It's such a creative question. It really opens the conversation. But they think, "Oh no, people are going to tell me all this stuff." No, mostly people tell you this. Once in a while you get a helpful piece of critique, "Oh, you make everything a priority, in which case nothing is, and you could work on that." Super helpful to know. We all have stuff to work on.

(00:25:43):
But I will tell you, once people do the listening tour, they're blown away. I mean, the people who are in jobs, they love, they love helping others if it's done well. Because guess what? They're also anxious themselves, and they want to give back. They want to feel like they're supporting people. You actually end up, and we're going to talk about this, but when you ask someone for help while you've done your homework, you're thoughtful, they want to help you even more. They become invested in you. So the secret about the listening tour is that not only are you getting market research customer feedback on your fit, you're also creating a whole group of listening posts, people who are invested in your success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
Just to clarify on that specific point of this listening tour, you write this Mnookin two pager, which basically describes what you want, what you don't want, goals you have, what you hate. And the listening tour is find colleagues, friends, people that are other, say, product managers and get their feedback on what you want, what you don't want, what you hate, what your goals are.

Phyl Terry (00:26:54):
And what they're seeing in the market, what they think you're a fit for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:56):
I see. Got it. So it's like, "Oh, this is unrealistic. You're not going to get this."

Phyl Terry (00:27:00):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):
Looking for that [inaudible 00:27:02]-

Phyl Terry (00:27:01):
And we see both things, Lenny. So some people underestimate their fit, others overestimate it or don't recognize that changed market condition. The other thing I'll say is that in the book I have three different kinds of structured listening tour conversations. One I call reverse exit interviews. This is people you used to work with before, go ask them, "Hey, what did I do well, what do you think my strengths are? What do you think I'm a fit for? Here's what I'm thinking. Do you think I accurately am projecting myself?" The second is your broader network, and that's where I ask you to do the golden question, "If you were in my shoes... " And then third is recruiters.

(00:27:43):
Now, this is an important hack. Recruiters don't like being barraged with, "Get me a job." They do like someone saying, "Hey, what do you think I'm a fit for?" asking their advice. And this is especially true if you pre-

Phyl Terry (00:28:03):
And this is especially true if you've pre-built a relationship with a recruiter. So anyone listening to your podcast right now, if you're in a job, I have a really important message for you. When that recruiter calls, pick up the phone even if you don't want the job, help them, network with them, introduce them to other people, and build that relationship, because whether you lose a job or whether you decide to start looking when you're in work, you want that relationship.

(00:28:29):
Now, Lenny, there's a problem many people haven't done that. Okay? So part of what we're doing with the Never Search Alone community is we're building a recruiter network. We're finding recruiters who are willing to, in a protected way, do a couple of conversations a month, helping people think about their candidate market fit. And if anyone listening to the show is a recruiter, please come join us and volunteer. We need more recruiters. I know many of you want to give back and you don't know how. You tell me this. Here's a way to give it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):
Mm-hmm. Love that. Okay, and so the intent of this is that you're trying to figure out, one, what does the market want, and how do I be honest about what it wants because what you want may not exist right now, and then, two, help you refine your pitch and how you're approaching and who you're talking to. Is there anything else that comes out of doing this exercise? Because I think people might be hearing this, like, "Ah, so much work. I have enough work to do, all these interviews. Got to reach out to people. I got kids and a family. I have to write this two-pager now and listening tour." What other benefits do you get out of this, doing this exercise?

Phyl Terry (00:29:37):
You build those relationships. You turn people on as listening posts, so you light up your network in a way that you... If you just send an email saying, "I want a job," or if you just go, "Hey, do you have a job for me," people don't know what to say. But if you say, "Hey, if you're in my shoes, how would you approach this, and what do you think if you were me I should be looking for, and what are you seeing in the market," they love that, and now they're really thinking about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
And if they see a job that might be a fit, they tell you about it.

Phyl Terry (00:30:07):
They tell you about it. Yeah, and that gets to candidate... Because at the end of this, we're going to create a very simple, narrow, focus candidate market fit statement at the end of listening tour.

(00:30:17):
So once you've now done this listening tour, now you need to create a focus candidate market fit, and this is tough. Look, again, this is why you need a job search council. You need them to be there with you during the listening tour. Not every listening tour conversation will be a home-run. Once in a while it'll be a dud. I talk about this in the book, like, "Warning there are some curves ahead." You could have a conversation... A number of women that I have worked with over the years who've gone and done conversations and they've gotten frankly sexist feedback... It was not helpful. "You're too poised," or "You're not poised enough." It's just this strange set of stuff. So you need your council to help you parse out and interpret what people are telling you.

(00:31:02):
And at the end of this listening tour, and it never really ends, but once you've done 10 or 15 and you're ready to say, "Okay, I'm going to take a stab at my candidate market fit," now you need your job search council because you're going to want... Every bone in your body is going to want that to be expansive, to want it to be broad. Remember, we're product people, at least those of us in Lenny's podcast community; what happens when we're building a product? Same thing, right? We want this product to be for everyone, but we've learned with product market fit, that doesn't work. We need a narrow, clear focus. Same thing with candidate market fit. So I say to people, and we have this whole grid that we give them, "I'm looking for a director of product role in a healthcare, series B startup in San Francisco," like "Bing, bing, bing," and people say, "Oh, if it's so narrow, I'm going to lose..." And here's the thing, when you're looking for a job, you need a spear and not a net. With a net, everything slips through.

(00:32:08):
Now, part two to this, people are expansive, but not reductive. What are you talking about, Phyl? Here's what I mean. If you give them a specific... If I say to you, "Lenny, I'm looking for a director of product role at a healthcare startup that's a series B in San Francisco," well, if you see another FinTech startup that's in a heavily regulated industry looking for a director of product that's a series B, you're going to be like, "You know what? Phyl is looking for that, but I bet Phyl could do that." You can be expansive. But if I told you, "Hey, Lenny, I'll take any product job I can," you are never going to think of me. You're never going to remember me. You're not going to be reductive from a broad statement, but you will be expansive from a narrow.

(00:32:52):
And I'll tell you, Lenny, this is so hard for people, and this is why, again, you need that council and you need that broader community. And every two weeks we do a LinkedIn Live where we address... We go over these questions again and again because it goes... If I were in the job search, I'd feel the same way, even with all the darn research I've done. It's really hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:13):
If you've been using this metaphor, approaching this like a product person, and this is very much like a product person thinks about new products is there should be a very narrow audience to start with kind of a wedge or an ICP. When someone's building this, what is a sign they've narrowed it enough? Are there a certain number of attributes? What tells you that, "Cool, this is small now"?

Phyl Terry (00:33:31):
So it's typically three to four attributes, and we give people a whole grid in a set of examples. So we had a woman who was a designer. She was a product designer. And what her product market fit was, she was looking for companies that either did not have a design team or needed to reboot one. So she wasn't talking about stage of business, or even industry, but that really plants an image in your mind. If you hear about a company that doesn't have design or looking to reboot design, you're going to think of her immediately because after you've done your listening tour and you've created your candidate market fit and your council signs off on it, Lenny, this is important, then you go back out to your listening tour and you tell all those people, "Thank you for your help. Here's the candidate market fit I've come up with." And you also post it on LinkedIn. You tell the whole world, right?

(00:34:29):
Now, will that candidate market fit change over time? Yeah, we're iterative, right? So if you go and go... And the market is changing. What was true three months ago may not be true now. Two weeks ago the stock market was convinced we're going into a recession, and everything crashed. Two weeks later we're like, "Oh, no, we're not going into a recession," and that affects the psychology of hiring managers and companies. Not just psychology, their willingness to open up, recs and everything else. So things are changing, so you need to be flexible and adaptive to that, which is also why you need the council and why you need to have a good network around you that you've asked for help from and they're invested in you and can be there for you as you try to keep navigating this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):
Just to follow us through it a little bit more, when someone is... Someone's thinking right now, "Okay, what are my attributes," what's on that grid, roughly? There's stage of company, I imagine there's-

Phyl Terry (00:35:21):
Stage of company, industry, level of role and function, of course, and culture.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):
Is there a set of options you have of type of culture?

Phyl Terry (00:35:30):
Basically everyone wants a good culture, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:32):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So culture.

Phyl Terry (00:35:38):
Sometimes it can be very specific, like, I need a company that has a particular kind of policy for kids, or whatever, remote or hybrid or whatever, that kind of element. But I tell people, make it simple. This should not be paragraphs and paragraphs. It should be a one-sentence statement. You can do a longer thing that you can then share with people when you're getting into the conversation, but you want something simple that people go, "Oh, Lenny looking for a chief product officer role. Oh."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):
Yeah. It's exactly like you want your product to feel too.

Phyl Terry (00:36:13):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
I need a SOC 2 compliance, so I'm going to think of-

Phyl Terry (00:36:17):
That's [inaudible 00:36:17].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:18):
Yeah, exactly. Okay, so I'm thinking through this list here. So level and role I imagine people get a pretty good sense of where they want to be. Stage, any advice for someone to decide what stage is right for them?

Phyl Terry (00:36:35):
If I were coaching someone which, as you know, I do, we would talk a lot about this. But when I'm in the book and in the community, I say, "To figure out stage again, I want you to rely on your job search council and your network and your own experience," and it becomes pretty... People usually have a pretty good sense, like, "Who was I talking to recently? I need a big..." Whereas many people are like, "I don't want that. I want a startup." Okay.

(00:37:01):
And what I will tell you is that one thing to keep in mind right now is that there are more jobs in the startup world than there are in the established companies in the tech world for product people. That's where new job creation has been happening. It's slower than it was before, but the big companies, they've just been shedding people. They've just been throwing them off. Whereas the smaller companies, there's more opportunity there. Now that doesn't mean that... If you can't stand working at a startup, I'm not telling you you should go there necessarily.

(00:37:35):
But I will say this, and again, if you need to put food on the table... We were talking to someone recently; they had moved to a new city and then were laid off the next day. They moved for the company, and then they were laid off the next day, and they're like, "Okay, I need to get a job." I said, "Okay, yeah, sure. Just know that if you're going to get any job just to have while you still look for the job you really want, just know that that's hard. That's a hard pen. I understand it and I support it, it makes sense, and it's hard." It's harder than you realize, and you absolutely have to keep your job search council, because otherwise you're going to get lost.

(00:38:16):
Can I share one story about candidate market fit-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):
Please.

Phyl Terry (00:38:19):
... that might be helpful to people? I was coaching... He was an EVP at a traditional media company, but on the digital side, running their streaming business, but it was very much an old economy, old media company. This was not a player in the streaming space. And they smartly recognized that if they stayed there, they were going to end up in a pretty bad cul-de-sac. And by the way, that company's had layoffs, and they would've... So they decided they wanted to go work for a company like Netflix or Apple TV. And they're someone who ran hundreds of people, corner office, limo, first-class, you know what I mean, in the airplane? What was their candidate market fit? They went out and did this, their candidate market fit, if they were going to join a top streamer was as an individual contributor, Lenny. Because those guys, they didn't respect much of what they brought from traditional media. And if he had done this search alone, he would not have done that. But to his credit, he decided to take that, and it transformed his career. He's not someone who had a lot of management experience, but also tied now with one of the top streamers. He's just done incredibly well. But that is really hard to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:35):
So in this example, when you talk about candidate market fit, a big part of it is what the market wants from you. It's not like he's like, "I'm going to go IC." He just realized as he was going through the process, "This is where I'm actually going to succeed."

Phyl Terry (00:39:48):
He talked to people, and I helped him network with people in Silicon Valley. They were just honest with him. And that's what Justin was talking about, this can be hard and humiliating at times to figure out... We had another person who was a chief product officer in a startup, and she was great. She helped me with the book, she was an early reader, she's a member of your community, Lenny. And she realized that she wasn't getting the right product trend. She was the only product person, and she didn't really know what she was doing. Well, what was her candidate market fit? It was an IC. It was an IC role, an individual contributor role in a larger tech company. And to her credit, she realized that was the right path for her learning, and she did this before the shoot really hit the fan. I'm in the tech world, fortunately. Just not swear.

(00:40:38):
I talk about this in the book. Sometimes you need a two-step strategy. Let's say you want to be a VP of product at a top streaming company or whatever it is, but you not a fit for that today. So the question is how do you step there? I tell a story in the book about a guy who'd been a VP of product. He wanted a COO role. He was not a fit. He was not a fit, Lenny. And it was very clear. The market was telling him, he did the listening tour, but he came back to me and said, "I don't care. I want a COO role." So he interviewed with 50 companies. 50. Can you imagine? It took them a year and a half. The 50th company hired him.

(00:41:15):
10 days later, they were a public company, massive fraud, and they went bankrupt. I said, "Okay. The market is clear. The only COO role you're a fit for is a company that's about to go bankrupt." And he's like, "Okay," and he went back to the VP of product role. I said, "If you want to become a COO from that role, where you are today, one of the great paths is to do it from that job inside a company." Okay? And that's what he ended up doing. It was a two-step strategy. He couldn't go straight there.

(00:41:46):
I'm not talking about people's innate worth, Lenny. I believe every human is worthwhile person, and I deeply believe in belonging and giving people support and spreading love and creating community. But I also believe in being practical and realistic. I didn't create this situation. I'm just trying to report to you what the situation is and how you can manage it so that you don't get stuck. How many people have you seen, Lenny, who get stuck? They get stuck in a bad job, they're not learning, and then they can't go from there? They get into their 40s and 50s, and it is tough. A number of people in the job search community who are in their 50s, 60s, whatever, they're dealing with ageism, they're dealing with... They're not close enough to the technology frontier. You got to get closer to the technology frontier, even if that means you're going to go from the EVP to an IC role. That's how creative destruction works. The closer you are to the technology frontier, the more new jobs and opportunities there are. The further you are from the technology frontier, the worse you're going to be over the long run. You might be able to get a better-sounding job in the short term, but you're going to find yourself stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):
I love your Venn diagram of just warmth and support and belonging, and also just straight real-talk. Here's the reality.

Phyl Terry (00:43:04):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:05):
What a combo.

Phyl Terry (00:43:06):
Oh, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):
This is such powerful advice, and I think people might be feeling like, "Yeah, I get it, but man, I don't want to be a IC again. I've been a director, I've been a VP. That sounds really not great." Is there anything else you can share to help people get past that, of like, "Okay, maybe I really should be looking for an IC role again?"

Phyl Terry (00:43:24):
Again, if you're in a job search council, and also you're in our Slack community, what you're going to find is that you're not alone. That's a big thing. It's not you. There's not something wrong with you. This is the market that we're in. And by the way, the more relationships you build, the better you do your listening tour... One of the tactics, Lenny, I tell people is you've got to send out an update note every month to all of your network that you've talked to. And it might be, "I don't have a job yet," or "I don't even have any news, but I just want to let you know I'm still going and I appreciate everything you've done for me and I'm still looking for X." That could be it. And Justin, in his note, I referenced him earlier as chief product officer, his note on LinkedIn today said, "Phyl told me to keep people updated, and I didn't do it enough." Don't make that mistake. You got to do that.

(00:44:12):
Lenny, I met with a group of about 50 job seekers recently who've been in the Never Search Alone community for more than a year. Okay? They're struggling. Again, I don't have a magic wand. But as I talked to them, what was happening? They stopped network. They left their job search council. They weren't updating their candidate market fit to the changing market condition. I'm like, "You have to do everything. You can't get passive." One of the concepts, Lenny, I talk about is you've got to be the I in village. There's no I in team. Well, there is an I in village, okay? And the I in village is that when I'm saying you've got to ask for help, you got to be a part of job search council community, you have to be independent and accountable and responsible. I'm not saying you're not going to become passive independent. This is how you become more independent. This is how you stand up and be even more accountable and responsible. This is how you can do the best search possible in the market conditions that we have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):
So the advice here is if you're struggling finding a job, this is a solution. Join a council, bring people on board with you, update people on your progress. These are the things that break you out of that funk that you're probably in.

Phyl Terry (00:45:26):
And it will still be hard. It will still be hard. I wish that weren't true, Lenny. Now, I will tell you that, look, what's the difference between now and the dot-com depression of 2000, 2001 and 2? The difference is that we were a much smaller industry then. And people had been in web jobs only for a couple years, where now we've got people who are in jobs for 10, 15 or more years in tech who have never seen a downturn, have never seen a market like this. We've never seen a tech market like this. It will improve at some point, but right now it's tough. And I can't change that, but I can provide tools, I can provide community, I can provide heart and smarts, so that you can get the best job you can get right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
Speaking of advice, is there anything else along the lines of candidate market fit before we move on to more tactics?

Phyl Terry (00:46:17):
Just that, again, that you're going to resist the narrowness of it, every bone in your body. Just know that that's what everyone is feeling. But go watch... I have this great video online of... He was a VP of product. He was initially masked, but VP of product at Nike. I met him through Marty and Chris at Silicon Valley Product Group. He joined one of our product councils, and then he decided to leave. And he was like, "Phyl, I love you, but this candidate market fit stuff, no. You're wrong. It needs to be [inaudible 00:46:57]." And so he went out and he actually spoke to a bunch of VCs and like, " We don't have any idea what to do with you. You have to tell us something really specific." He was like, "Oh, man." So he went, he's like, "Phyl..." So he redid it, bam, bam, bam.

(00:47:12):
I tell another story in the book about Dee. She was a chief data officer of a large company in tech, wanted to become a CTO. She had a technology and engineering background, as well as data. She spent a year spinning her wheels alone. I said, "Join a job search council." She figured out her candidate market fit. It turns out she was a great fit for a mid-size regional bank CTO. And within three weeks she had three offers. A year, nothing. Within three weeks, three offers.

(00:47:43):
So I can't guarantee that you're going to get three offers within three weeks, right? I'm not saying that. Some of you, it might take you six months or a year. And the more senior you are, Lenny, the longer it is. If you're a CEO, it's going to take you a long time, unless you happen to be the CEO of Chipotle, who just became the CEO of Starbucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):
Yeah. Yeah, I know you're creating a page that we're going to link people to, which is, I think... Is it phyl.org/lenny?

Phyl Terry (00:48:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Okay, cool. And is it going to have this template to help you work out your market fit?

Phyl Terry (00:48:13):
There'll be a link to where you can download not only that template, but all the templates. You don't even have to join a job search council to get all this stuff. I hope you do. Again, it's free. I will say, early on people were like, "What's the trick here? This is free, and you're going to charge me." No. No, this is free. Why am I making it free? Because, one, I can, which is cool; second, this is in honor of my mom; and third, I want to create a private safety net for the ravages of creative destruction. It's great. A lot of positive consequences, but there's negative ones. And I just don't love the idea of charging people for this. I charge people for other things, but not for this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:58):
And we'll link people to the things you charge for so they can support you and benefit you in other ways, or benefit themselves in other ways.

Phyl Terry (00:49:04):
Benefit them and me. That'd be awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):
Let's talk about some other tactics. You mentioned this idea of playing to win, and I think within that, there's this kind of OKR in mission tactic. Let's talk about that.

Phyl Terry (00:49:15):
50%, Lenny, of the people who read my book, join a job search council, and follow everything I've described, the people don't do what I'm about to tell you, it is the biggest mistake and miss, and I'm really sorry about this. I'm on a campaign, right? So here's the thing. When you start to interview and negotiate, you've got to be in charge. This is collaborative coaching. I want you to play to win, not to lose.

(00:49:49):
Now, when people hear me say that, they translate it in their brains into, "Oh, Phyl is saying that I've got to be a ruthless negotiator." If anyone who knows me know that ruthless is just not how I am, at least in this sense. No, no, I'm like, "What I want you to do," and it's a great tactic that we stumbled upon, and it's one of the best tactics in the book, and I really hope we can get the other half of the people who are in the community to do this, and your listeners who aren't involved who decide to join also do this, when you start interviewing, I want you to create your own version of the job description. I want you to do it privately, Lenny, and I want you to create what I call a job mission with OKRs.

(00:50:38):
Now, most job descriptions, they suck, Lenny. The company doesn't know what the eff they're doing. They don't know exactly what they're looking for. But I'm not telling you to say that to them, just to be clear. I'm telling you, "I want you to create your own job mission with OKRs." This is key. It needs to be with OKRs. Now, your audience knows what an OKR is, objectives and key results, and I assume I don't need to explain that. It needs to be something where you are saying, "Here's what I think I'm going to be accountable for. Here's what I'm going to actually... the outcomes I'm going to deliver," right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:13):
At the company that you join.

Phyl Terry (00:51:14):
At the company you join. Now, you'll keep it private at first because drafting it... This thing has multiple benefits. The first is drafting it will help you understand and develop great interview questions to ask them to clarify, what is this job? And they'll be impressed by that. Okay? The second thing is, once you've had a couple of interviews, and it's a draft... Now, it's not a full, final thing. This is so important. I want you to pull the hiring manager aside and say, "Hey, Lenny, you're the hiring manager. I've thought about what the role is. I want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. Can I share something with you?" I don't want you to email it. I want you to do phone call, Zoom, or coffee or whatever.

(00:51:54):
Lenny, can you imagine how hiring managers feel when they get this job mission with OKRs? I was talking to a senior guy at Amazon who's hired more than 2000 product leaders and others. He said, "Phyl, no one in..." He's part of our product account. He said, "No one in my life has ever done this. If someone did this, it would blow my mind. I would hire them on the spot." And that's the message I want these folks to understand.

(00:52:22):
We talk about silver medals, Lenny. In the job search, the silver medal sucks. At the Olympics, hey, it's pretty good. You get to be on the podium. But guess what? Silver medal is... It's almost worse than... Because you were almost there. And we have a number of videos and other things where we talk about the difference, in many cases, between getting the silver and gold has been doing the job mission with OKRs. Companies say, "This is what distinguished you. This is what..." We were like, "Who is this person?" They're already thinking about what they're accountable and the outcomes, and naturally they're thinking about it better than I am, which is fantastic, right? So it raises the odds, but it also does something if you present it...

(00:53:02):
Again, Lenny, you're the hiring manager. I show you my job mission OKRs, and you're like, "Oh, this is fantastic," but you also say, "Oh, this thing you have here, this OKR, this isn't part of the role. Well, that's helpful to understand, but this thing that you don't have listed is." "Oh, really?" Lenny, how many times... I'm going to ask people in the audience to raise their hands. How many times have you taken the job A that turned out to be job B? Everybody just raised their hands, Lenny. So this helps to address that, right?

(00:53:35):
And then if you get the offer, and again, this raises the odds of getting the offer, it then sets you up to negotiate what I call the four legs of the negotiations tool. This is not hard negotiation. This is something the company loves. I actually say, you get an offer and it's like whatever, $250,000 base with a 30% bonus. This may be a director or whatever, or senior manager. Maybe it's an 800 base if you're more senior, whatever it might be. I want you to go and talk to the hiring manager, if possible. Hopefully not the recruiter. We'll talk about that. And I want you to say, "This is great. I want to talk about money, but before we do, I want to think about some of the things that will set me up to see succeed in this role. I think there's like $10 million of tech debt here. Does that sound right to you? And are we on board that that'll be priority one to eliminate the first day I start the job?"

(00:54:39):
We had two CPOs, both interviewing at private equity firms, private equity-owned companies, about the same size, SaaS companies. One had tech debt of 20 million, one had tech debt of 10. I told them both, "You got to talk about that in the..." So one talked about it in the negotiation, and the company was like, "Oh, that's great." They wrote a check on day one. Six months later, the tech debt was relieved. They updated the systems. They were able to get into innovation. A year later, they got promoted to a GM role in addition to their CPO role, and then a year after that, they were being interviewed for the CEO role. The other person, where there was 10 million of tech debt, was kind shy about asking, sort of mentioned it, they were like, "Oh, we'll talk about it when you get here," but they didn't really commit, and they never addressed it. One month, six months, 12 months, 18 months later, he's looking for a job. This is the opportunity cost of not being set up for success.

(00:55:34):
Now, again, don't hear this as antagonistic. We're not antagonistic here. We're trying to say, "What's going to help me succeed?" So one CPO recently was negotiating... I'm not just talking about budget for tech debt or whatever. If you're a senior person, do you think that team needs more training? Do you need to send them over to Marty's workshops, over to my product councils, right? Get them into Lenny's community. The company was like, "You're negotiating the training budget of the team that you don't even run yet-"

Phyl Terry (00:56:04):
You're negotiating the training budget of the team that you don't even run yet while we're talking about your salary? Who are you? We love you, we're going to pay you even more. Lenny, companies love this. And even if you're a junior person, you're not going to negotiate budget, but you can talk about mentorship, professional development, will you be able to attend conferences or training? Again, and this is, we're not hard negotiating this, we're saying, "Here's what I think I'm going to need to accomplish the OKRs that we've already agreed upon."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
This is really cool advice, I want to make sure people super understand it. So an example of tech debt. This person asked, "I need $10 million budget in order to address this tech debt."

Phyl Terry (00:56:42):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):
I see. So it's not like, "I believe we will save $10 million if we spend on time." It's like, "Here's how much this team will need and I will need to be successful."

Phyl Terry (00:56:51):
I'm going to need a check for $10 million on day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
I guess you're right, someone would be shy asking for that. Or that was $20 million actually, that was the one that asked for it.

Phyl Terry (00:57:00):
That was the 20 million, that was right. And again, it was not... Yes, people feel really shy about this, but the companies love that they understood what it was going to take. I will tell you what, if the company doesn't like this, it's a huge red flag. Huge red flag, it means they're not serious. But if you're talking to them, "Hey, I think we're going to need train the team. I'm going to need to hire three more ICs," or the design function is weak, or whatever it might be. And then you're like, "Do you agree? Do you see it this way?"

(00:57:37):
And they're like, "Yeah, that's right. Good. Wow." You're already like bang, bang, bang. We haven't even finished negotiating your salary. And this is so counterintuitive, Lenny. I'm the queen of counterintuitive stuff. Kelly Marcus said it's counterintuitive, right? But this is as well. People think they're going to lose the opportunity when it actually wins them. Now, of course, if they marched in and said, "Damn it, you have to do X and Y," right? That's not what I'm talking about.

(00:58:10):
"Hey, here's how I see it. This is the OKRs. I think we're going to need this. Does that make sense to you?" And you're having a collaborative conversation about how you need to be set up for success.

(00:58:21):
And by the way, if they say, "No, I hear you. I believe you, but no," then you make a judgment decision. I'm not always saying you turn that away. Well, especially if you need a job, but you're now going in eyes wide open. You are not going to be able to believe that tech debt initially. You're going to have to work within that constraint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
So I love that we're getting into negotiation advice by the way, because I was hoping we'd get there. So the advice here is identify something that you'll need to be successful, and your finding is that when you ask for, and it seems like a financial investment as a part of you joining, ends up leading to a better comp for you.

Phyl Terry (00:59:00):
Yes, and I will say that there's less negotiating room today than there was two years ago because of the market that we're in. And the data all bears that out, and we see that. But here's the other piece of data. So I want you to ask for things that tie back to the OKRs that you've already agreed on with the hiring manager. This is how this thing connects together, right? It's like Legos, and then we come to the money and you've had this lovely conversation. You've shown them how much you're invested in succeeding. See, Lenny, the problem that every hiring manager has is distinguishing be someone between someone who is a good talker, and someone who can actually make things happen. You know this, right? And this is true every from individual contributor to CEO.

(00:59:50):
By doing the job mission of the OKRs, and by showing them that draft, you are showing them. Not telling them, showing them that you take initiative, that you're accountable, that you can make things happen. And then in the salary negotiation, by talking to them about what you need to succeed, you're showing them that you really want to succeed. And guess who that benefits? That benefits the company, obviously. I want you to do that first and then, okay, so then let's talk money. Now, 87% of the time, Lenny, when you ask for more money, you get it. Now, that's a longitudinal statistic, meaning over many years. It's going to be lower in a moment like this, but you can still ask, and people are afraid to ask. Again, don't ask in some shark way like some of my friends in business might do. Some M&A negotiators, whatever. No, ask, are you open?

(01:00:48):
Unless it's a deal breaker. If it's a deal breaker, just be open about that. But if it's not, let's say they offered you whatever it is. 400 base with up to 100% whatever in some RSUs or options, blah, blah, and you really wanted 450. Lenny, you can say, "Hey, are you open to 450? That was really what I was hoping for. What I think I'm worth, are you open to that? Is that something we can talk about?"

(01:01:16):
And most of the time they say yes. They may not get you to 450. They may be like, "You know what? Yes, thank you. Let me get back to you." Or, "No, we could go to 420. Does that work? Great."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):
You make it sound very easy.

Phyl Terry (01:01:30):
Here's the thing-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:30):
I hate negotiating. Yeah, go.

Phyl Terry (01:01:32):
I do too. And I talk about this in the book and Jason Fried, who you know. Jason Fried's got this great thing where they have all very clear bans, 37signals, well, at Basecamp. He's like, "Because no one's trained in negotiation, how can we expect people to negotiate?" And there's another thing Marty says about my book. He says what he loves is that companies have all of these resources. They've got lawyers and HR people, and you're there alone.

(01:01:57):
That's why you need your job search council. This is when you really need to ask for help because every bone in your body is going to say, "I'm not going to negotiate. That's going to make it worse," and it almost never does. And again, you could be a jerk about it, that won't be good, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about collaborative conversation. I'm talking about what you need to succeed, showing them that you're thinking about resources, support, budget that will help you deliver on the things that you signed up for. And then asking, are you open if they didn't quite hit your range.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
Yeah. The way you phrase it, make it very low risk to ask.

Phyl Terry (01:02:35):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):
Do you have any specific advice on doing this over email, over phone call, or in person? Is there something you're like, "Definitely do it in this way."

Phyl Terry (01:02:43):
Strongly, strongly want you to do it either in person or over the phone live with the hiring manager. Now, some companies won't let you do that. You have to talk to the HR person or whatever. But as much as you can work with the hiring manager, even if it's to say, "Hey, I just want to run by you some of the things I think I need to succeed in the role before we talk money with the hiring manager," or whatever. With the recruiter I mean, and they'll go to bat for you behind the scenes if you do that. Not guaranteed, but more like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):
Yeah, that's totally true because oftentimes you don't really have a specific budget as a hiring manager.

Phyl Terry (01:03:24):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:24):
So to you it's like, "Sure, 450, let's make it happen."

Phyl Terry (01:03:27):
That's right. Now some companies like know this and they're like, "You have to talk to the person we designate the internal recruiter," but you can also get back to that hiring manager, and even informally. Again, if you've built a good relationship and everything is about building good relationships, Lenny. I want you to be a good interviewer. I want you to ask good questions. I want you to listen. I want you to present that job mission OKRs. It shows how innovative and how much you take initiative and how much you're thinking about this and how much you want this, right? Every step of the way.

(01:05:13):
While we're on this topic of negotiation and comp, is there anything else there that you might want to share that might be helpful to people?

Phyl Terry (01:05:18):
In the book, before you do the listening tour, I ask people to do what I call the gratitude house exercise, which is to think about who are all the people in your life who have helped you get to where you are today? I mean, you could talk about your third grade teacher, you know what I mean? I'm just talking on, I just want you to do that, and I want you to do that because everyone has this idea that they're alone. We have all received enormous help to do what we're doing, whoever we are. Even the [inaudible 01:05:51] was born to a mother, and they did not make it themselves for their first several years of their lives. We all are born of mothers. We all are born as families and communities. Some better or worse. I had a pretty tough childhood, but there was love.

(01:06:09):
I want you to do that gratitude house exercise, and then it can sometimes surface people that you'll go talk to in the listening tour. Might not talk to your third grade teacher, but you'll go talk to some. Now when you're going into interview, I ask people to take a moment and re-reflect the gratitude house exercise, remind themselves of everyone they're carrying with them, to imagine that they're on your shoulders. All of those people, including your job search council of course, and everyone you've talked to and you're listening to, you're walking in with 50 people, Lenny, okay? Even people who tell me, "I don't know anyone." Now, that is not true. You might not know as many people as I do, okay? That's understandable. My job is to know people, but everyone knows some people and you bring them with you even metaphorically, so that you feel not alone when you're going into that interview.

(01:07:10):
The other thing I say with the interview and the negotiations is you've got to go do the debrief right afterwards, Lenny. Because we all have these cockamamie ideas about what happened. We think we did terribly when we did well, we think... We need to talk it through with someone else who can help us parse exactly what happened and really where we're at. I had a woman who was a director of product, she was interviewing for a VP of product roles. She texted me after the interview, "Oh, I screwed it up," this and that, this and that, "but they really liked me and we're going to go to the next round."

(01:07:41):
I'm like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. Something is not true here."

(01:07:48):
This is just your own imposter syndrome and inner critic. That's another exercise we ask people to do, by the way, is what we call the inner critic exercise name the critic. Mine is Tub Tour. I was overweight when I was a kid and my dad called me Tub Tour.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:04):
I learned that tactic from Julie Cameron from The Artist's Way, she recommends that.

Phyl Terry (01:08:08):
Yes, she's great. Love that book. By the way, it's on my bookshelf back there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:12):
I love that. I think I called mine Jim. Yeah, we had a really good episode. I don't know if you saw with Joe Hudson, he has a whole series of advice on your inner critic, and his point, and I'll point to it is your inner critic is always lying to you.

Phyl Terry (01:08:30):
I did see that episode. I love it. We all have it. People think, "Oh." Everyone. And that's what I love about this moment we're in too, Lenny. I started in therapy in the 1980s. In the 1980s, you did not share that you were in therapy, okay? Today, we have tennis stars talking about their emotional well-being and their therapy and how they're doing. It's beginning to normalize in some really important ways that emotions, they're not bad. They're actually really important to the decision-making system, but they can go off in certain ways that can really hurt us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:13):
And it feels like these councils are like a lite therapy for people.

Phyl Terry (01:09:16):
Yes. I would never want to say the word therapy because of course that implies certification and training, but there's a therapeutic aspect to it. I feel comfortable saying that, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. So on this gratitude house, just come back to it real quick. The reason that is powerful is that gives you confidence to ask for stuff to believe in yourself. You're worth something-

Phyl Terry (01:09:37):
Gives you confidence to walk in there as who you are, Lenny. Not as your inner critic, but as the whole good person that you are. And when you show up, this is one of the reasons job search councils are so important because if your anxiety and fear starts to run away and erode at your confidence, it will hurt your interview. You will not show up well. So you're not going to even, even in a down market you're going to get even, you won't even get the jobs that your candidate market fit suggests you're good for in that down market. You're going to slide down a few more notches, or you just won't get offers, and then you're going to get paralyzed and feel like you're really worthless.

(01:10:17):
And if anyone watching this has been out of work for a while and feels that, let me just tell you, you are not worthless. You are not worthless. I want you to invest in yourself, to prove that to yourself that you're not worthless. You are worth the investment of this time and energy. I'm not asking you to do this for me, I'm asking you to do this for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
You got tingles when you said that. That was a really powerful message. I'm glad you said that.

Phyl Terry (01:10:46):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):
So yeah, so we're on this topic of playing to win. And what you just said is along the same lines is just remember, you're playing to win. You're not trying to lose, you're not trying to find-

Phyl Terry (01:10:56):
Not lose, just be really, I just can't say anything. I just can't rock the boat. I'm not asking you to rock the boat. I'm asking you to take charge and demonstrate the power of who you are. These companies will love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:10):
When I asked a lot of people to ask you what you're amazing at, one of those common themes is really good at just asking for help and teaching people how to ask for help, which was actually an topic for a recent newsletter post by one of my newsletter fellows, Natalie. So let's talk about it. Talk about why this is so important, why you spend so much thought and time on this topic.

Phyl Terry (01:11:32):
First, I want to shout out my mom again. So my mom's name, her nickname was Chic, C-H-I-C. Her friends and family and I dedicate the book to Chic, and she started that first council in 1960, and she asked for help. Of course, she taught me to ask for help, and to start councils. And of course, when I was very young, I didn't want to do what my mother said, right? You're not. But I ended up in a bad situation and she's like, "You've got to ask for help," and I asked my high school teachers for help. I was an alcoholic at the age of 12, Lenny, and things were really spiraling downwards. I was no longer living with my mom, there's a whole long story about that. I was in a pretty unsupportive position, and she's like, "You've got to ask for help." And so I did.

(01:12:23):
And OMG, Lenny. I mean, I was carried by these teachers. And I also have to give a shout-out, and I'm going to cry now to my girlfriend in high school, Karen Kavanagh, whose family had very few resources. They were struggling, but they made a home for me, and I couldn't have done it without them and some of my other friends and my teachers. I worked a full-time job by the age of 16 and I was going to high school, and I was in a tough situation. It was transformative, Lenny. It was transformative. Did I feel like asking for help was a weakness? I did. Did I think people were going to think less of me? Absolutely. I thought all the things that people think, and it is not what happens.

(01:13:24):
Now, there is a warning here. If you ask for help poorly, and I'm going to define that, it does end up leading to bad consequences. What do I mean by asking you poorly? I mean, if you don't do your homework, if you're asking for someone to do it for you rather than advise and support and give you perspective, we all know that. I get these emails, Lenny. So when I started the product councils, Marissa Mayer was a founding member, right? Marissa Mayer at Google and Miriam Moheed at Amazon. And as Marissa's reputation grew, suddenly everybody wanted to talk to Marissa.

(01:13:57):
So I got all these random emails from people I've never met. "Oh, I've got software, would you please introduce me to Marissa? I think she'd want to license it or buy at Google."

(01:14:08):
I'm like, "Who are you? What? That is the dumbest." Of course, I'm never going to answer that, right?

(01:14:13):
If they had reached out to me and said, "I know you don't know me. I have this small software company. I'm not well-connected, but I would love your advice on how to grow this business and what you would do if you were in my shoes," which I have never received, Lenny, even though I've written about it and said about, I would've done that phone call.

(01:14:34):
And then if they have said, "Well, can I talk to Marissa?"

(01:14:36):
I'm like, "You have not earned that yet. That's not a statement about your worth. It's just you're not ready for that conversation."

(01:14:48):
So you can do it poorly. But if you do it well, if you've done your homework and you're open, oh my gosh. There's four counterintuitive rules here. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of confidence. It both requires confidence and strengthens it, Lenny. That's number one. Two, it's not a taking activity, it's a giving activity. If you do it well, you're actually being giving to the people you ask. This is really counterintuitive, Lenny. This is what I teach in my product councils. I'm like, "You have to ask for the money." If you ask for help and you're open and vulnerable, you're a smart person.

(01:15:27):
So at one point, Marissa came in and said, " Listen, I'm developing a new product. I want to present it to the board, but I'd like your feedback on it first, and what do you guys think?" Am I approaching this in the right way?

(01:15:37):
People were like, "What?" Google was already a public company at this point. Wow, that, they were just blown away. They were so happy to help.

(01:15:48):
So if you've done your homework and you ask someone who has some expertise in the area that you have, and you do it in this way, "I'd love your perspective and thoughts and how would you approach it?" People feel given to, they feel given to. Here's the thought experiment that'll prove it. Imagine that somebody that you respect comes to you for help on an area that you have expertise. And they ask you in this way, how are you going to feel, Lenny? How do you feel?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:17):
Like they value. Like they value my opinion-

Phyl Terry (01:16:20):
You feel honored, and you feel excited, and you love giving. Everyone loves giving, it's a part of human activity. And you learn more when you give, of course, because it helps you see something new. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It's not a taking activity, it means you're becoming more independent, not independent, and it doesn't hurt your reputation, it improves it. Something I did not understand when my mom was trying to tell me to do this, Lenny. And it took the experience to drill into my head.

(01:16:49):
And then I will tell you, I won't name names, but one person that you asked, who's a prominent product person who's worked at great companies, right? He said ask him about asking for help. I think he would agree with this. He'd been a member of the product councils for a long time. I think it took years before he really embraced it. I've seen many people, they're like, "Bill, I know you keep talking about this asking for help thing." And I know there's something to it, but it is transformative, Lenny. It is transformative if you learn to ask for help well.

(01:17:25):
I can tell you about Brad Smith at Intuit who toppled the stock price there. But he was a GM. He became a CEO. He was a GM. He ran a project and he didn't do it well. He lost $300 million for company. He thought, okay, that's over. But they came to him and said, "What's your lesson here?"

(01:17:46):
He said, "I didn't ask for help. I was pigheaded. I didn't listen to my team." That's a great lesson, and if you really internalize that, then it's worth it because you're great in other ways. And he ended up getting to the CEO role. And what did he do? He joined a council, right? And he asked for help. Boom, boom, boom. Stock price goes up 7X in his tenure, okay?

(01:18:08):
Kenneth Chenault at American Express. Joins in the 1980s, one of the few African Americans in professional roles there. Ends up as a CEO and chairman of the board. First African American chairman of a Fortune 50 company. You ask Kenneth Chenault as I did, how'd you get there? He asked for help. And by the way, what did he do once he became CEO? He got on a CEO council.

(01:18:33):
And by the way, who asked for help? Well, this is going to blow your mind if you. Warren Buffett. People think Warren Buffett only listens to himself and Charlie Munger who passed away last year. That guy asked for help. Well, it doesn't ask anybody for help. He asked people he respects and so on, but that guy asked for help. Every single leader I've ever worked with that has done well asked for help. And I have data in the book. 85% of the people get to a senior role credit asking for help to help get them there. 85% of the people in a junior role say they're afraid to ask for help because they think it's a sign of weakness.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:06):
Perfect.

Phyl Terry (01:19:07):
It's literally the same number if you can believe that. I couldn't believe it when I did the data. I was like, "What?" But it's really, and guess what? If you don't learn to ask for help and you're a junior person, you're going to remain a junior person most likely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:19):
When you say ask for help, what are some examples and common times and uses of asking for help? Because it could be like, "Hey, can you just look at this email for me?" Or is it like, "I'm struggling with this project?" What are some things that you've seen when people think ask for help do this.

Phyl Terry (01:19:35):
One of the things that Kinshaw talks about is what he calls defining reality. So it's a CEO at American Express, he was constantly just going around and asking different people in the company and outside the company, "How do you see things? What are you seeing? What are you thinking? Help me understand your perspective," right? So that's a form of asking for help, for sure. Okay.

(01:19:52):
Reviewing my email absolutely is a great form of asking for help. If you're sending a good email, an important email let's say, and let's say you have a history of maybe sending emails that don't get well received, you go ask for help. And by the way, I have a whole workshop where I teach people how to use ChatGPT with some communication models to help you with that email. So there's ways to do that with ChatGPT. But I still, if it's a really important email, want you to have eyes on, right?

(01:20:22):
There's a woman who became the president of a digital retailer in the United States about five years ago, and then she realized that she had significant technical debt. The project, they were trying to build a new platform, and it was stuck. So we convened what we call a peer coaching call, and I also talked about this in the book. We got three other presidents of retailers, online retailers who had re-platformed and spent an hour, just one hour with her asking them for help. "What would you do if you were in my position?" I mean, bing, bang, boom.

(01:20:55):
So when people get a new job, by the way, I tell them, do a first 90 days peer coaching call. I want you to talk to people who are in that role today. Not at that company necessarily, but they're a director of product, they're a VP of product, whatever it might be. And I want you to say, "Hey, I'm starting this job. Here's my job mission with OKRs. What would you do if you were in my shoes? What mistakes have you seen others or yourself make that I need to avoid? What should I focus on? Here's what I'm thinking for my 30, 60, 90."

(01:21:24):
Whatever it might be, I want you to do a first 90 days call. Now, let's say you're a director of product in a job is going well, and you want to get to a VP of product role. Well then, I want you to do a career evolution call where you're talking to VPs of product. "Okay, I'm a director. I want to become a VP. How do I get from A to B? Will you tell me?" And that's another peer coach you call. So these are the things we do in the paid community, in the product councils and stuff. But you can do these on your own, right? And I tell people how to do them on their own in the job search councils.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:54):
Perfect.

Phyl Terry (01:21:54):
Are these helpful answers?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Absolutely. I think all these examples you're sharing is exactly I think what people are wondering. Just like, okay, I see.

Phyl Terry (01:22:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Feels like it's not-

Phyl Terry (01:22:02):
Can I share one more?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):
Please.

Phyl Terry (01:22:03):
That's so great. So Bradley Horowitz joined Google in 2008 as director of product. He had come from Yahoo, but he was initially intimidated. He had a weekly meeting with Jonathan Rosenberg, who was the SVP of product, with Susan Wojcicki. Susan just passed away tragically. Absolutely fabulous person by the way, if people don't don't know her, go learn about her. Marissa Mayer, and also another director of product named Sundar Pichai, right? Who is now the CEO of Google. And Bradley, he was nervous, he didn't know how to be in that meeting.

(01:22:42):
One of the things I tell people, when you ask for help, use your emotional intelligence, use your product council if you're in a job or your job search council, if you're looking to get feedback on, am I thinking about this well? Because I don't want you to ask the wrong people for help. Someone who's going to take advantage of that. You have to be thoughtful about this.

(01:23:02):
He was picking up vibes from Sundar that he was very approachable, that he lacked guile. Bradley told me Sundar just made it easy for him to say, "Hey, after one of these meetings, could I ask you a couple of questions?" And he says, first question he has is, "Is this meeting, is it just me or is this meeting intense?"

(01:23:21):
Sundar was like, "Oh, no, no, this is intense. I feel the same way you do and I've been here for a couple of years."

(01:23:29):
So they start to build a bond, and that's a form of asking for help. It's like you're checking, is your experience the same as mine or am I missing something? And then Horowitz who felt relieved at this point, felt more trust with Sundar, decided to ask him another question and this question. And by the way, now Bradley, he's kind of embarrassed that he asked this question, although I'm really happy that he did, I told him this.

(01:23:56):
He asked this question, he basically said, " I haven't been here very long, but you, Sundar, you strike me."

Phyl Terry (01:24:03):
"I haven't been here very long, but you, Sundar, you strike me as a really thoughtful person and great leader. Why is your remit just working on a toolbar for Marissa?" Whoa. Heard the wrong way, that could sound like an insult or something, rather than an honest attempt to understand the culture of Google and how it operates. But again, he had trust with Sundar at this point. And it was an open and vulnerable question, and it was great. Pitch I basically said, "Listen, I don't worry about title or scope or any of that. I've really been focused on just doing good work and letting the right things happen. That's the culture of Google." I will tell you that that was more true of the culture of Google in a way that's not so...

(01:24:48):
You have to be a little more politically aware at Google today. But the point is not so much the exact question he asked, but that he was open and vulnerable. He was thoughtful about who he asked, and it really made a difference in terms of his entry into Google and eventually led him to the VP of Product role. Of course, Sundar came into the CEO role down the road, but that's what I'm talking about, right? He was part of the product councils, Bradley. You need to have that sounding board so you can be thoughtful about... I teach people how to map and figure out who their allies are and their blockers and play what I call positive politics. That's all in my next book, Never Lead Alone, just to give a little. Don't worry, at least a year away.

(01:25:32):
When I write a book, I do... I did 400 drafts of Never Search Alone. I had a couple of thousand people help me with it and 200 people read it and use it. I had 2,500 comments and 400 drafts. I like to really dock through this stuff. I'm doing the same with Never Lead Alone. That's how I know it works, by the way. I'm a prouded person, Lenny. I mean, that's what we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:57):
[inaudible 01:25:56]. That's amazing. Let me ask one last question around the art of asking for help. So we've talked about when to ask for help a little bit. What are just a couple tips for how to do it well? You know, people come to me and like, "Hey, can you look at this email?" And be like, "No. I'm pretty busy. I don't know if I have time to look at an email."

Phyl Terry (01:26:15):
Have to think about the relationship, right? Again, showing that this random, small software company wanted to talk to Marissa Meyer. I didn't know them, they didn't know me, and they didn't know Marissa. That's not going to happen, right? Lenny, if your mom or your close friend or your colleague who you work closely with says, "I want you to look at this email," you're going to respond in one way. If some person, let's say in your podcast community, which is great, wants you to do it, I mean, you have thousands of people there. You can't do that. People come to me for job search advice in the job search community. I said, "I can't do that. I can't scale that. That's what the Job Search Council and the Slack community is there for. I appreciate you asking, but that's what the deal is there."

(01:27:03):
You got to think about the relationship. Listen to your emotions. This is where, again, emotions are really important for decision making. If your emotions are telling you, "I don't know if I trust this person," don't get all open and vulnerable with them. I want you to learn to ask for help in a counsel format where it's really safe. You can flail around. You can ask in fakakta ways. There's ways to ask for help where it's like... Have you experienced this, Lenny? Where I want you to do me a favor, but I'm actually acting like I'm doing you a favor. Lenny, I have this person to talk to I know is really going to be great for you to talk to, when really I'm trying to get you to give me... Whereas I should said, "Lenny, I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing to do this?" You just say yes or no. That's the other thing, I really want you to be honest with people about what you're asking. I never want you to hide the ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):
That is really good advice. A lot of times it's just, yeah, okay, if this is just a favor for you, absolutely.

Phyl Terry (01:28:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:05):
[inaudible 01:28:06]

Phyl Terry (01:28:06):
I mean, if people would say to me, "I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing?" "Yeah." Most of the time I'm going to say yes to that, you know?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):
Yeah.

Phyl Terry (01:28:15):
Do you get cold introductions, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):
Where people introduce me to someone else without asking. Yeah. It's not a super common, but it does happen, for sure.

Phyl Terry (01:28:23):
It almost never is someone you want to talk to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:26):
Yeah, that's right.

Phyl Terry (01:28:27):
It's not like, "Hey, let me introduce you to Sergey Brin," you know?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:31):
Yeah.

Phyl Terry (01:28:34):
It's [inaudible 01:28:32]. No. It's like they're trying to help somebody and you're doing them a favor, but they're not being honest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):
Yeah. Okay. That's amazing advice. Phyl, we could talk for hours about so many things. You're involved in so many other things I want to hear about, but maybe one last question before we start to close out our chat. Just a broad question, is there anything else that you think would be valuable for people to know or leave with as kind of a final note around either job hunting, asking for help, anything else? And then I'm going to ask you to share all the things that you do for people that maybe could benefit from one of these other programs.

Phyl Terry (01:29:08):
When my book came out, we did a book party in New York and the host of it, very senior product person, got up and said, "The most important thing about this book that I learned," and they run a Job Search Council, "was, and I said this earlier, but I want to come back to it, everyone feels anxious and insecure in the job search." Lenny, everyone. It's built into the fabric of how capitalism operates. It's not something problematic in your head. It's the instability of the system, which gives it its dynamism, but which also creates trends in security and fear. Everyone feels that, Lenny. You are not alone. But my saying that is not enough. What I say in the book is that this book is like a cookbook. You don't get the calories from reading it. You got to actually make the dishes. To experience what I'm saying, you need a Job Search Council and you need to go like, "Oh my gosh, it's really true, I'm not alone. Even Lenny. Lenny feels this. Holy, I respect Lenny. Wow, look at everything Lenny has done and created, and he feels this way. Maybe I'm not crazy." There's so much else to this, but that is such a core point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:37):
That's such an important point to leave with. And just to build on exactly what you just said about me, this strange life that I've created for myself, I originally called the project Avoid Getting a Real Job because I was worried about that. I forced myself to try something else instead.

Phyl Terry (01:30:53):
That's amazing. That's amazing. That's great. Well, thank you, because you have created something that's really meaningful to a lot of people, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:00):
Thanks, Phyl. So have you. I'm so thankful that you made time to share so much advice. I think this is going to be one of the popular episodes I've done. I think it's going to help a ton of people, but we're not done yet. Tell us about some of the other stuff that you've got going on. You've mentioned product councils, you do coaching, just so people know what else might benefit them.

Phyl Terry (01:31:17):
21 years ago I started these product councils. And by the way, I like to show this Marty Cagan, and I go back to the late nineties, early... He was actually a client of mine when he was at eBay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:31):
Wow.

Phyl Terry (01:31:32):
And I'll tell you what happened. We were about to sign a project and he decided, he called me up. Literally, we were signing that day. He called me up, "Phyl, I got bad news." "I mean, what are you telling me?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:40):
Now?

Phyl Terry (01:31:41):
"I'm leaving."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:42):
Come on.

Phyl Terry (01:31:42):
"I'm leaving and I'm starting something." And he started the Silicon Valley Product Group.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:47):
Oh, wow.

Phyl Terry (01:31:47):
But why am I saying that? Because that was around the time that I started the councils and I started with Marissa. Basically, I went out and did a listening to her Lenny and I said, "Listen, I think for those of us left in the digital world after this depression, I think we need a place to come together that's not a conference with sponsors and people that are all trying to sell each other. We need a private, safe, secure environment to really talk. Does that resonate with you? Do you want that?" And they were like, "Yes," so I started this thing and Marty has been involved from day one. He has sent me something like 30% involved with members we've had over the years. We've had a couple thousand members and he just sends people over, which has been amazing.

(01:32:33):
And so we have product councils for VPs and CPOs. We also have an associate council program for ICs and new managers. We started that a couple of years ago. It focuses on women and people of color and LGBTQ, but not exclusively. So you can be a white guy who's straight, whatever, and you're a product manager. What we care most about is if you're willing to ask for help, and you're really committed to being there for each other and being a part of this community and activity. And so that's what I've been doing for years. And I have a great team and amazing... Teresa Torres was one of the moderators of our private councils, by the way, and great friend, and been on the podcast here. Gino, obviously great friend of yours. She asked me to really emphasize asking for help and share some of the stories that I did. She's just been such an important part of my life. I can't say enough about her.

(01:33:28):
We've got those and we have CEO groups and we have [inaudible 01:33:31]. That's my day job. That's sort of what pays the bills and I've been doing for 20 plus years now. But then I also have a series of other learning communities. I'm one of these, I read. If you asked me, "If you had one job title, what would it be?" Reader. I read, Lenny. Books are machines to think with. Books are machines to think with. And I'm on a campaign to get more people reading more because... And product leaders need to read more. I have a whole bunch of book recommendations on my Lenny page, by the way, that are for product leaders, and we can talk about a few of those. But I also run something called the Reading Odyssey, which is a partnership between scholars and readers at Harvard, Cambridge, for lifelong learning and curiosity.

(01:34:22):
I run the World Business Reading Group for high school students. It's a high school business literacy. Not financial literacy, business literacy program based on the philosophy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Mugger. And taught by really senior executives, like partners at venture capital firms, hedge funds. And I'm an investor. We have this amazing faculty. It's pro bono. We're all volunteer. We have a small charge for middle class families and it's free for anyone who can't afford it. And it's a summer program and it's going gangbusters. What else?

(01:34:54):
Oh, Slow Art Day. So one of the things I teach people is that you need to develop mentors. Most people do not have mentors, Lenny. 95% of the people in my community of senior product leaders do not have mentors. And mentorship programs, it's like the typewriter. Our parents or grandparents have them, but we don't have them. The companies don't offer. One of the ways that everyone listening to this podcast today can get a mentor, you can get what I call a dead or distant mentor. Warren Buffett is my mentor, he just doesn't know it, which is great. I don't have to listen to everything he says and he doesn't have to take my calls. Steve Jobs is my mentor. And when I talk about mentor, I don't mean just, hey, I'm a fan, or I like the products, or I read the biography. I mean really study.

(01:35:46):
If you really study Jobs, you have to come to 1997. He's interim CEO. So he was fired from Apple in '84, '85. Actually, after the Mac came out. He wandered the wilderness for 10 years. He created a company called Next, which wasn't next. And then in '95, '96, Apple buys the operating system from Next, and the company is in really bad shape and makes Steve the interim CEO. Interim. They wouldn't give him the full title. They're like, "Ah, the business is so terrible. You're going to destroy it anyway. Whatever. You'll be interim." And he does a bunch of stuff, but he gives a talk in 1997. He's got tattered hole jeans. There's 300 people at the developers conference. They all are pissed off. And he gets up there and he says, "You have to start with the customer, not with the technology." And that's what we're doing it at. People talk about that customer. If you really study Jobs, that's what he did.

(01:36:49):
And what does that mean? I can tell you there's a lot of product people, Lenny, who talk about customer and don't really focus. And if you really study that moment and study what Jobs did, it can inform your decisions and actions. So one of the things that Jobs also talked about was the power of art and that everyone needs to go to art museums and that you need to be inspired and it will help you think about design if you create great products. So I started a company, something called Slow Art Day, which has now been in 1,500 museums around the world. It teaches people how to slow down and look. And especially for Lenny's podcast, I am making free both the teacher materials, the leader materials, and the participant materials so that all of your podcast listeners who are running product teams can go to a local museum and do an offsite and develop more visual literacy, empathy, connection with each other, and an understanding of art that will help them be better [inaudible 01:37:46].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:46):
That is amazing. I'm going to try to do that myself.

Phyl Terry (01:37:49):
It will blow your mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:51):
So you mentioned Marty Cagan and Christian a couple times, and Marty Cagan described Chris as the most interesting person in the world. I feel like you deserve that title. You're doing so much and so much good and so much variety of things. It's really impressive. And the amount of impact you're having is wild.

Phyl Terry (01:38:10):
Thank you. It really means a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:14):
I'm just saying it how it is. I'm really thankful you've shared so much wisdom on this podcast with everyone. I think that's going to help so many people. We're also not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Phyl, are you ready?

Phyl Terry (01:38:28):
I am ready for lightning round.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:31):
Here we go. And you've talked about books. I imagine you're going to have an answer for this.

Phyl Terry (01:38:35):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:35):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Phyl Terry (01:38:38):
Of course, I've recommended hundreds, but right now what I recommend is Creative Destruction, and I'm going to give your listeners the link to the right book, it's by a group of French economists. It's a little bit academic, but it's so important. It's so important for product people to understand. It is so important. More jobs get created because of creative destruction. There's not net job loss. There's more jobs created. AI is going to create more jobs, not destroy. Everybody got that wrong. Almost everybody, except the people who understood creative destruction. But you have to be close to the frontier. That's where the job creation happens. And product people, you got to be close to the frontier. You got to do whatever you can. If you're at a company that's not close to the frontier, do stuff at... I was working at Moody's Investor Service and I built one of the first 2,000 websites back in the early nineties, Lenny. I was doing all this stuff outside of work. That was bringing me closer to the technical frontier and was changing my candidate market fit. So I recommend that book.

(01:39:36):
I also, of course, I recommend Marty's books. Now, I want to just say again, I don't want you to just read Marty's books, listen to his podcast, the great interview you guys did here at Lenny's. I want you to read and reread those books as if he's your mentor. And rereading is important, Lenny. And people say, "Oh, I listened two or three times speed on the audiobook." You are not going to have that deeply inform your decision making. Now what I'll do is I'll read a book and then I'll listen to it as a reinforcement, or I'll read it and listen to it at the same time. For the important books, Lenny, you got to read them more. And Marty's books are important.

(01:40:20):
The last book I'll recommend is The Manual. It's a short introduction to Stoicism. People misunderstand Stoicism. They think Stoicism means repressing your feelings. That is not what Stoicism means. It means understanding and accepting your feelings, but not necessarily always being driven by them. Incorporating them. Your feelings are an important part of your decision-making system, but they shouldn't rule you. And it's a really important book. I have driven a lot of sales with that book because I really hammer it home in my book. So if you go on to Amazon, you'll see the book that's most bought along with my book is that book, right? I have other books I recommend that are on my website, but those are two or three.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:58):
Amazing. On the listening to things at fast speed, I sometimes meet folks that listen to the podcast and they're like, "Oh, this is what you sound like at regular speed, because I just listen to every podcast fast." Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Phyl Terry (01:41:16):
So there's a great new TV show on Apple TV that is not getting the audience that it deserves. It's called Las Azules. Las Azules, the Blues. It's about the first women recruited onto the police force of Mexico City in 1971 or 2. Of course it speaks to me because 1970s, these are women and my mom and how close I was to her and what I... I saw the world through my mother's eyes, Lenny, and it really shaped me. It's a great TV show. I love that. Of course, I love the show that I've always recommended and everyone's now seen it, I hope. If they haven't, it's been out for a while, but it's... Oh, the name just escaped me. The American football coach who goes to England and becomes a soccer coach.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:10):
Oh yeah.

Phyl Terry (01:42:11):
How can I forget this? I've recommended it so many times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):
That's the guy's name, right? The character, Ted Lasso.

Phyl Terry (01:42:15):
Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso. Thank you. So the kindness in there. And by the way, a great message around asking for help in that. The last thing I'll say, of course, is the Inside Out movies. The second one came out this summer. Just the way it's normalizing emotions, again, and helping us start to talk about emotions. Really love that. Okay, what else in the lightning round?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:36):
So there's this next question that I cut. I moved to other questions, but I wanted to bring it back with you. It's about your favorite interview question. You help a lot of people interview and interview better. I'm curious if there's a question that you've heard that you really like.

Phyl Terry (01:42:50):
If you are interviewee for a job and it's a senior level job, I want you to ask, "Tell me about a time that you, the company, brought in a senior level person and it failed, and why?" Because they often fail bringing senior level people into companies. So ask them what happened and why, and figure out how can we avoid that outcome. And hopefully they're going to have a good answer. I have a whole bunch of questions in my book, but I love that one.

(01:43:19):
I also love, if you are on the other side, if you're hiring and you want to check references, I have the most amazing question. The most amazing question. By the way, this is the best thing I learned in my two years at the Harvard Business School. I learned this in my running and growing a small business class. It's like the best thing I've learned. It is, if you want to get references, what you do is you want to leave a voicemail or you could send an email, whatever. And you want to say, "I'm about to hire Lenny. Okay, if it would be a huge mistake if I didn't bring him on, if you think he's amazing, then call me back. Otherwise, don't bother." And that gets around all the legal blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's just it cuts through. I love that question. I don't know if that resonates with you as much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:10):
Yeah. So is the idea if you don't hear back from them, they're not necessarily amazing?

Phyl Terry (01:44:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:15):
Wow.

Phyl Terry (01:44:16):
Yeah. You're leaving that space there. And by the way, I love doing that for back channel. When you start a job or when you are accepting an offer or interviewing, I want you to back channel that boss a little. Talk to people who've worked with them, if you can. Use your network and ask them, "Would you work with this person?" And even say, "Hey, if I called you and told me I was interviewing with this guy and you should only call me back if you thought I should take the job, would you have called me back?" You'd know, and so you can do a form of it that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:47):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's like a digital app?

Phyl Terry (01:44:50):
I'm going to give you a very different kind of answer than I would normally give, but I'm hoping you and your community will appreciate this. So I did recently discover it, but I'm going to talk about a book, Lenny. So 25 years ago, a guy named Robert Strassler, who was a business guy, he started teaching at a special high school for kids who were dropping out. And he was teaching them some of the classics like Herodotus and Thucydides, expert, and they couldn't get it. And the books were terrible because there was no context, so he spent 10 years and he reinvented the format of a history book. There are 120 maps. Each of them he drew specifically, and they're only relevant to the previous one or two pages. Okay? There's a margin summary in plain English for each paragraph describing what that paragraph just said. He got the top scholars in the world to write two-page appendices on their expert topic, things they've written hundreds of books about, hundreds of pages about, you have to do it in two pages.

(01:45:58):
And by the way, the publishing world wouldn't back it. He funded it himself. He hand drew the maps. He spent two years creating a concept index, not just a keyword index. And it's just blown apart the whole industry. Completely disrupted. He sold hundreds of thousands of copies of these books. They are a masterpiece, Lenny. They have Landmark Series. Landmark. They have new ones coming out. Every product person, in my opinion, should go look at this and look at the product design of this book. It is masterful and it teaches you a lot about usability and the reader experience. I want product people, Lenny, to get out, who are doing digital work to get out of the digital world and look at products outside the digital world for inspiration and thinking, because I don't want you all looking at the same stuff. You're going to just create the same stuff. I love tools like Calendly, which I just didn't... I've been using for years, but no one could get it right until they got it right. Those are great. How's that for an answer?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:06):
That's incredible. So what is it called again and where do you find it?

Phyl Terry (01:47:09):
And it's going to be on the Lenny page. If you get on [inaudible 01:47:12], if you do Landmark Herodotus or Landmark Thucydides, either one, you'll get there. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:19):
Oh my God. Sounds incredible. Great choice. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often like to think back to and share with friends or family?

Phyl Terry (01:47:27):
Of course, we talked about asking for help, and I say that a lot. But I also love, and I said this earlier, books are machines to think with. And as product people, Marty and I talk about this all the time, we have to be thinking. And I coach people all the time, how can I think more? You've got to read more because books are machines to think with. Good books. There's a lot of bad books in the business world, but good books. Good books, thoughtful books. Books that'll help and shift your perspective, whether it's history or science. I read widely, and I want you to do the same. Books are machines to think with. That's probably one of my greatest lines.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:09):
Final question. Usually I try to make this fun, but I want it to come back to something practical for people. So to leave people with something they could do this week to help them find a job or help them improve the chances of finding their job, what's something you'd recommend?

Phyl Terry (01:48:22):
I have one very simple thing. Go to Phyl.org and sign up for a Job Search Council.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:28):
There we go.

Phyl Terry (01:48:29):
It's free and it will transform your search. Is it a good [inaudible 01:48:34] answer, or were you looking for something different, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:36):
Beautiful answer. It also is exactly what I would've asked you next, which is just where do people go find the stuff you're up to and learn more about things that we've been talking about?

Phyl Terry (01:48:44):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:44):
There's phyl.org and then there's phyl.org/lenny, which has a lot of the templates and things that you referenced.

Phyl Terry (01:48:49):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:50):
Amazing. Final actual question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Phyl Terry (01:48:54):
That's such a lovely question. So on the Lenny page at Phyl.org, I outline some ways. We're raising $100,000 right now to build a platform for job seekers. It will remain free for job seekers. Part of what I'm doing is I'm doing a speaking tour on AI, and I'm taking all my speaking fees and putting it to this, but people can also make a donation just to that. They can also volunteer. And we're looking for, if anyone's a Salesforce admin, I'd love to have you volunteer with us. If any of you have really good PHP experience, let me know. If any of you are really good at Typeform or Formsite, which is a tool I don't like much. By the way, if anyone from Formsite is listening, your tool sucks. You need to really improve the product there. There's a lot of different ways that you can help, but those are some of the things.

(01:49:48):
But most importantly, tell someone who you know in your life who's looking for a job, that there's a community here for you that's free, that has all these smart tools and resources and people who are genuinely here to help you and who will help transform your search in this very hard moment. People ask me, "Is this good in the hard moment?" This is born out of hard moments.

(01:50:12):
In a great job market, it's easier to say, "Oh, I can just grab a job." You need to be more thoughtful in the down market. Now, I think you should be in the up market too. This is our moment to be there for people. This is what. And I would love, so many people still don't know this, Lenny, we want millions of people. We want to help millions of people. We have 20,000 hours of volunteer time already. We want to have millions of hours of volunteer time. We are changing something about the way capitalism works with this community. We are changing this negative consequence of creative destruction that people have just been left to fend with on their own.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:54):
Well, I'm excited to be helping spread the word. Phyl, you're wonderful. Thank you so much for being here.

Phyl Terry (01:51:00):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:51:02):
Bye, everyone.

# Building Wiz: the fastest-growing startup in history | Raaz Herzberg (CMO and VP Product Strategy)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're one of the first 10 employees, you're the first product manager. It was when you joined, the founders didn't really have an idea figured out yet. When they landed on an idea, and then ended up being wrong, ended up not working. Six weeks after you joined, there was a pivot.

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
At the time, we didn't really have a solid product yet. We would have 10 to 15 meetings every day with potential customers. I was hired as the first product manager. I sat in on those calls.

(00:07:01):
I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing, because I was a product manager, so I was supposed to start building it, and so, at some point, it was like, "I have to ask, what exactly are we doing here?" And that ended up pivoting us around to cloud security.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
So things started to click a little bit more, you started seeing enthusiasm. Can you talk about just what that phase was like?

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
We really felt the type of questions change, right? Silly. The call sounded like, again, "How are you pricing this, or when can we start doing a POV?" I think naturally, as human beings, you have a bias to look for affirmation, versus a bias for what you don't want to hear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
You started as an engineer, you moved into product, and now you're marketing, which is not a traditional path.

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
I had a ton to learn about marketing, with what I knew really well, with ...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
Today, my guest is Raaz Herzberg. Raaz is chief marketing officer and VP of product strategy at Wiz. Before moving into marketing, Raaz was an engineer, and then, for most of her career, was a product manager. Prior to Wiz, Raaz led security products in Microsoft, including Azure Sentinel, and with Wiz, moved from VP of product to CMO.

(00:07:01):
If you haven't heard of Wiz, it's not only the world's fastest growing security company, it's also the fastest growing software company in history, hitting 100 million ARR, just 18 months after founding, and then, just under five years after founding, was rumored to be exploring an acquisition by Google for over $23 billion.

(00:07:01):
Even more wild, as you'll hear in our conversation, the team initially went in circles on what they wanted to build. And it took them awhile to actually land on the idea that is basically the most intense product market fit of any B2B company ever.

(00:07:01):
In our conversation, Raaz shares what signals told her and the team that the original idea wasn't going to work, and that what changed in their conversations, when they finally found product market fit, why she moved into marketing, and what she wished she knew as a product leader from her new marketing lens, also, her perspective on marketing, and what marketing people often get wrong, and why CMOs often fail. Also something she calls the dummy explanation. Why you need to pay attention to where the heat is within the organization.

(00:07:01):
She shares her most contrarian take on leadership, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and there's so much to learn here for product leaders, for marketing leaders, and for founders.

(00:07:01):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Raaz Herzberg.

(00:07:01):
Raaz, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
Thank you for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
So I want to start by giving a little context on Wiz, for folks that aren't super familiar with the company. You launched just under five years ago, at this point. Within 18 months, you all hit a hundred million ARR, which is the fastest growth rate in history of any software company. It's faster than the two other companies I've had on the podcast, that also claim to be the fastest growing software companies, Deal and Ramp. You guys grew even faster.

(00:07:01):
I read that you are at over 500 million ARR now. I know it's also not confirmed, but a certain company that rhymes with Loogle, offered to buy you guys for $23 billion, and y'all turned that down, decided to stay private. And also, something like 50% of Fortune 100 companies are customers of Wiz.

(00:07:01):
Is there anything I missed? Anything I got wrong?

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
Never heard of that Loogle company, but other than that, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
Okay. Okay, great. We're going to come back to that. What's even crazier is in spite of that, when you joined the company, you were employee, something like, number seven?

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
Yeah, we kind of started, I feel like, the founders, and the first six, seven employees, we just started at once.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication, and SCIM provisioning.

(00:07:01):
That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly, and get back to building other features.

(00:07:01):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google, to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:07:01):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted, to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control, or other enterprise features, like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS.

(00:07:01):
It's a drop-in replacement for Auth-Zero, and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workok.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:07:01):
This episode is brought to you by Rippling, a single platform to build and scale your startup on. Rippling handles all the "can't get it wrong" admin work of payroll and benefits, giving you back hours every week, but it does a lot more than that. Rippling is a game-changer for the entire company, with tools for HR, IT and spend, all built from the ground up, and designed to work together seamlessly.

(00:07:01):
Just hired someone? Rippling makes onboarding easy, whether your new hire's sitting next to you, or halfway across the world. In just a few clicks, Rippling automatically generates an offer letter, ships a laptop with the necessary apps and permissions, and even delivers a corporate card.

(00:07:01):
An employee needs to update their benefits contribution? When they do it in Rippling, that change automatically syncs to payroll. CTO forgot her laptop in an Uber? Lock it remotely, with Rippling.

(00:07:01):
Many startups I've invested in, like Sprig, Elemy and ClassDojo, use Rippling, because it's a force multiplier for lean teams, helping them eliminate major headaches, and operate their business more efficiently. For a limited time, Rippling is giving Lenny's listeners three months off.

(00:07:01):
To redeem, visit rippling.com/lenny. That's rippling.com/lenny. Okay, so for one of the first 10 employees, you're the first product manager at Wiz.

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:01):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):
And what I read is that when you joined, the founders didn't really have an idea figured out yet, when they landed on an idea, and it ended up being wrong, ended up not working. Six weeks after you joined, there was a pivot.

(00:07:02):
So the fact that that was true, and you went from this, "This isn't working," to boom, $100 million dollars AR, I want to spend some time here, because I think there's a lot people can learn here.

(00:07:13):
So let me just ask, looking back at that point when the idea wasn't working to realizing, "Hey, maybe this is a better idea," what do you remember are some signals that told you this isn't working, and okay, maybe this is, because a lot of founders are in that stage with their products?

Raaz Herzberg (00:07:31):
When we started, it wasn't even Wiz. The company was literally officially founded as Beyond Networks, because there was this idea of, "Hey, we want to do something in the network security space."

(00:07:43):
Actually, myself and the founding team, and also, the other five engineers that started with us, we actually all came from a background of building cloud security products before, but this time it was like, "Okay, we actually don't want to do cloud security, we want to do network security."

(00:08:00):
What happened was in those initial few weeks, it also, we started was literally, exactly, Wiz was founded together with COVID. It was that March when the whole world shut down. Suddenly, everything went terribly, terribly strange on all of us. That's when Wiz started.

(00:08:19):
So it was like, our days looked like talking to 10, 15 customers. Wiz is a B2B product, the buyer is the CISO, the people, the person that owns basically security for the entire company. So we would have 10 to 15 meetings every day, with potential customers.

(00:08:39):
At the time, we didn't really have a solid product yet, but we had an idea, and the deck explaining our idea, and what we're going to build, and why. We were all a very technical group of people, and especially, our founding team, a staff, our CEO at Wiz. Before Wiz, he led the entire division of all of the Microsoft cloud security products. So they're very, very impressive, very technical, very well known and respected in the industry.

(00:09:09):
And so, we would join a call, and kind of present and walk through our idea, and the person on the other end would be like, "Oh, it sounds interesting. Oh yes, sounds interesting, we'd love to hear more. Yes, perfect. Sounds interesting, we'd love to hear more." And you finished calls with a good feeling, like the person said, "Oh yes, interesting, interesting."

(00:09:32):
But like you said, I was hired as a first product manager. I sat in on those calls, sometimes officially participating, sometimes, even, not officially participating, but listening on all of the calls, and I finished a couple of weeks of that, which is a lot of calls, I think, two weeks or something. I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing, because I was a product manager, so I was supposed to start building it, in some ways, go to the dev team and start building it. And that was a point where I felt like, "I don't know what we are talking about exactly."

(00:10:10):
Now, I really thought, "I don't know what we're talking about. I thought they all understood what we're building, and I thought every customer we had in the call, understood that we were building." It's just that I did not understand what we were building.

(00:10:24):
At some point, it was like, "Okay, I have to ask. What exactly are we," like, In the details, right? Not in describing a big problem, in a high level, big potential approach to solving it, but what exactly are we doing here?

(00:10:44):
And I think that that ended up opening a really deep discussion of, "Okay, wait, maybe we are telling a bit of a broad story, and maybe the person on the other end is not going to tell you." They're not incentivized to tell you, "You know what? I don't know what you're talking about."

(00:11:02):
It's really, I guess they felt a bit like me in some ways, and they were like, "Oh, it's a really smart group of people. I'm sure they're building something interesting." So yeah, interesting. They're not incentivized to really dig, deep dive into the problems, right?

(00:11:14):
So I think that opened up a discussion for us, and we kind of understood that we were listening in the wrong way, maybe, that we were looking for positive reinforcements, but not really listening intently to signs of deep enthusiasm, and that ended up pivoting us around to cloud security.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):
There's so much to learn, just from the short story, and I want to get into what you started hearing that made it sound like, "Okay, wait, maybe this is a better idea." But first of all, just the fact that you're doing 10 to 15 calls a day, you said?

Raaz Herzberg (00:11:41):
That was a bit of, in some weird way ... Again, Wiz was founded in that terrible March, where the world closed down. It seemed, at the time, a really bad time to start a company. Markets were frozen, and everything.

(00:11:55):
Even my mom, which knows nothing about what exactly I do or why, I mean, I left Microsoft to join Wiz, even my mom was calling me and telling me, "This is not a good time to join a startup." But it ended up being in some ways, like an advantage, because everybody were home. Suddenly, everybody were home, no meetings, no travel.

(00:12:15):
So suddenly, C-Sales, which are busy people, and we started, originally based in Tel Aviv, so we couldn't even fly, but suddenly, it didn't matter. Because, I mean, everybody's home. So yeah, we took 10-15 calls a day, back to back to back.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:30):
I think that alone is a really important lesson of just, that's how you discover something that isn't working/find the thing that is working is, do many, many calls.

(00:12:38):
That is a lot of calls. I don't even know how someone has time to do 10 to 15 calls a day. But again, I think that's how you do this. So I think that alone is a really important lesson for folks to take away.

(00:12:46):
I love this point, that people are going to try to be nice to you, especially if they think you're really smart, and especially if you're describing things that might be helpful to them, but what you're sharing is, you need to not trust, that often is deceiving.

(00:13:03):
Talk about what it felt when it moved from just, "Oh, this is cool, this is nice, and maybe let's talk more," to, "Oh, maybe this is actually something they'll buy."

Raaz Herzberg (00:13:12):
We really felt the type of questions change. Suddenly, the call didn't end, was like, "Oh, this sounds super interesting. Sure, please update me. I'd love to hear more." Certainly, the call sounded like, "Wait, again, how are you pricing this? How much will this cost?" Or, "Wait? When can we start doing a POV? How long is a POV?" Or somebody would finish the call, and be like, "Okay, I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team."

(00:13:35):
Those are really strong indications that are the type of indications we learned to look for. Although there's something I think, at the beginning of a company, it's very scary. I think naturally, as human beings, you want to get affirmation from the other side.

(00:13:53):
So you're actually, you have a bias to look for affirmation, versus a bias to look for what you don't want to hear. That's just natural, being a person.

(00:14:04):
So I felt like, that is what we ended up really being in tune with. "No, I have to understand. They're intently interested. They want to connect me to somebody. They want to know how much this costs."

(00:14:15):
If somebody just tells you, like you said, "Oh, super cool, yeah, I want to take this as a good sign, but I shouldn't."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:23):
It's almost like you need to see them pushing for the next step is what I'm hearing is, "Let's do a POV, what's the next step to do this? I want to connect you to this person, to talk further about this," versus just, "Oh yeah, this is awesome. Thank you." And then, okay, bye.

Raaz Herzberg (00:14:34):
Yeah, exactly. And also, in B2B, that is really the process you have to take, after you have to get connected to the actual team that will test the tools, will deploy it. There needs to be real passion about doing something, and I guess that is the difference. It's real passion about, "Hey, I want this right now."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):
The other point you made is that you were the person, nobody was saying this thing that was this elephant in the room, almost of, "What are we even building? I don't understand what's happening here."

(00:15:05):
I read somewhere that you were like, you told, "I need to quit. I don't understand what this is, and I'm not the right person for this role," and it turned out, nobody understood exactly what was going on. Can you share that story?

Raaz Herzberg (00:15:17):
It's funny, because it's a story that some of the founders tell, and they tell differently. They tell, "She came to us, and she was like, we have to rethink," but that was not my perspective at all, right? My perspective was genuinely, "Okay, I have to confess, that was my perspective."

(00:15:38):
I was sure that I was the only one not understanding. It's hard to get the courage, I guess. Sometimes, it's hard to get the courage to say, "Actually, I don't understand." But I think by now, in my career, it's my favorite question.

(00:15:56):
I feel like I say, "I don't understand," a lot of times a day. I think, if you build a company with the right type of culture, in a sense, then it's not a shame to say, "I don't understand, or please explain again."

(00:16:14):
It's having that culture in place that enables it. And I also have to say, when I think of the founding team, and the founding team in Wiz, Wiz is a very flat organization, in some ways. It's not about seniority, it's really about driving impact, and everybody can have a seat on the table, and voices are heard.

(00:16:32):
And I think it also reflects really highly about them, just giving me the seat at the table, in a sense, to be even able to say, "I don't understand."

(00:16:41):
Then, when I'm saying I don't understand, not actually being open to, "Oh, maybe we have to also think again." I think that tells a lot about the culture, even, to this day.

(00:16:52):
But it's definitely, for me, it's a very learned quality over my progression of my career, actually allowing myself to be more vulnerable, more easier in saying, "I don't understand, or I don't know."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
I love this lesson so much. One, partly because you said it's really scary to be the person that's like, "I don't understand," right?

(00:17:12):
That puts you, that's a very vulnerable thing to say, because you're like, "What? She doesn't get it. Maybe she is not as smart as we thought." That can't be easy, to be the person doing that.

(00:17:22):
The other thing is this reminds me of Tomer Cohen, LinkedIn CPO, has this really great phrase, "We may be wrong, but we're not confused." I feel like that's exactly what you're saying here.

Raaz Herzberg (00:17:31):
Exactly, which is why I love this question to this day. I love it. I do think that if something is not easy to understand, then maybe it needs a bit more chewing on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
I love that. Okay, so things started to click a little bit more. You started seeing enthusiasm. Can you talk about just what that phase was like, and any lessons from just that turn to, things are actually working?

Raaz Herzberg (00:17:59):
I have to say, I think the feeling, after we made that switch, what ended up happening is that after that big conversation that we know, I don't understand, we ended up having, and this never happens, I don't think it's ever happened since. It was almost a long, five-hour discussion, with all of the founders, where we decided to move away from that pivot to cloud security, which is what we really, in some ways, know best.

(00:18:25):
That's our background, that's what we did before, and we felt the problems there was so big and so strong, and once we started having the conversations with the new pivot to cloud security, the room felt so different. I mean, it was all over Zoom, but our room, it felt very different.

(00:18:49):
Once we found the right path, it was so easy to distinguish it from the wrong path, in some ways, because we did start getting those strong signals. And in some ways, they pushed us forward.

(00:19:02):
A customer was like, "Okay, I want to start a POV," and we're like, "Oh, okay. Of course. Let's schedule for Thursday next week, or something. We tried to even postpone it a bit, because we had to run fast."

(00:19:15):
Another learning I have from that phase was, I explicitly remember that first conversation, where it was like, "Okay, let's do a POV." It was a Fortune 10 company, a really big company, and we had a beginning of a product. We wanted to buy some time, until we actually started the POV.

(00:19:33):
Just because of that, we said, "Okay, also we want to really understand exactly what they will connect to us as part of the POV," because everything was so initial. So we put this long list of technical questions, "What are you using for this? What are you doing here? What are you [inaudible 00:19:47]?" On the one hand, because we needed to know, to actually build a thing, on the other end, just because we wanted to buy time, and I was super scared.

(00:19:55):
I remember studying that e-mail, and being like, "Ugh, they want a POV. And now, I'm going to scare them away, with this list of things they have to do, and list of questions, like it's counterintuitive."

(00:20:06):
But actually, it came back filled a day later, and I remember my lesson being, "You know what? This is actually good. I want to make sure they're committed, right? I don't want to push somebody into a POV, if he is not committed to me at this stage." I mean, it's not a well-built product. It's going to be a journey we take together, so they need to really want it. I need that commitment from the other side.

(00:20:32):
I'm not trying to push something on someone, especially not at this point, and my opinion, not ever, not even today, not even when you sell at large scales. I'm not trying to push anybody to anything, I really want to make sure they want it. I have to feel that want back. So that was another learning for me.

(00:20:49):
It's like, first of all, when it works, it works, and you do know when it works. And the second is, "Don't be too afraid to get the pull from the customer." It's okay. You need that pull from the other end, as well. Don't push too hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):
I know people always talk about, "Look for pull," and I love that you're describing what pull looks like. Somebody's next day, filling out a really complicated annoying questionnaire, because they just want this product they've never heard of before you chatted with them.

(00:21:14):
Now, they're like, "Just give it to me now. I'm going to do anything you need." Is there anything else along these lines, before we move into your current role and learnings there?

Raaz Herzberg (00:21:23):
I also think that one of the things we did very, almost uniquely, it was, was that, because things started rolling so fast for us, once we found the right path, we ended up selling before we had a seller's team.

(00:21:37):
We ended up, almost in some ways, always being behind, right? Okay, I'm closing contracts with people, I haven't hired my first salespersons, I don't know what we're doing here, I don't know how to have the conversations.

(00:21:49):
But we ended up learning so much from that, from us, ourselves, us being the founders, myself, closing the deals, actually going all the way to contracts and everything, by ourselves. We learned a lot, we learned a lot.

(00:22:04):
And then, when we hired our first sales hire, it was also like, "Look, we sold a couple million of this, so you, for sure, as a salesperson, you kind of give that confidence."

(00:22:14):
So I felt like there was multiple places where that ended up happening, just by accident, because of how fast things ended up happening for us. Actually, it was a really good learning experience to do it for the first time yourselves. I think, sometimes, when you start building a company, you have this wish that if you can't do something, you're going to hire the right person, and he will be able to do it.

(00:22:36):
Okay, I feel like my message is not clear enough, and we just started this company, it's okay, I'm going to hire my first product marketer, and that's going to be it. Or I feel, we can't close a deal, because I need to hire my first salesperson, and that will be it.

(00:22:49):
I hardly find that, I don't think we've ever had that work for us, honestly. It's like, if you can't do it one time end to end, and you're the core, core group, the chances of just bringing somebody from the outside to solve that problem, it's wishful, in some ways, but it never ends up that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:08):
I love this advice so much. There's kind of two parallels here. If the founder can't do it, who has the most context and passion and motivation? It's unlikely an employee's going to be able to do it. And it's similar to the selling point, that if your early customers aren't pulling from you, later customers are not going to have a good time, right?

(00:23:27):
It's like, the most passion comes early. How long did you all stay, doing sales as a founding team? How many millions ARR, roughly, do you remember?

Raaz Herzberg (00:23:39):
Oh, a couple million. I don't remember the exact-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:41):
A couple million?

Raaz Herzberg (00:23:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
Awesome. That's incredible. Often, the heuristic I hear is, one or two million ARR, and then you start to hire salespeople. Okay, that was an awesome lesson. I love that.

(00:23:53):
I want to talk about your current role. So currently, you're CMO, and also, VP of product strategy at Wiz. You started as an engineer, you moved into product, and now you're in marketing, which is not a traditional path, especially for product people. First of all, why did you decide to move into marketing, from product?

Raaz Herzberg (00:24:11):
Yeah, it's not a traditional path for anyone, I think, also not one I would have necessarily expected myself to be on. First of all, it's not like I had this plan, right?

(00:24:22):
In general, I myself, people sometimes ask me about career progression, and I never had a plan for anything. That is just, the only thing I did was follow good people around. That's it. I never had a plan for anything I do.

(00:24:36):
So myself, coming to Wiz was following Assaf and Ynon in the founding team. And two and a half years into Wiz, at that time, Wiz was already, it was a very clear product market fit.

(00:24:50):
Our revenues were already there. We had a sales team that was fully functioning, but at that point at Wiz, we felt marketing was still something we didn't fully figure out. It wasn't working super well for us. We were at this stage where, yes, if there was a POV, a proof of value happening, we would win it, versus competition.

(00:25:13):
But many times, we would come to a customer, and they would be like, "Oh, I wish we heard of Wiz, we just signed with a competitor," which it breaks your heart, because I know they would have chosen me, had they heard about me in time. So you started feeling that challenge around awareness and marketing. So two and a half years into the company, basically Assaf, our CEO, asked me if I was willing to take on marketing.

(00:25:42):
Originally, I thought it was, I remember, he knocked on my, bothered me while I was working on my computer, and we went into this super cold room. It was like, when you were a fast-growing startup, all of the rooms are always full, you know what I mean?

(00:25:58):
We went into this server room, which is freezing cold, and I was in the middle of something, and he told me, "I think you should lead the marketing org now." I told him, "Okay." I was like, "Assaf, I'm cold, I'm going back to work. I have a lot to do." It sounded that bizarre to me.

(00:26:12):
It's not only, do they not know marketing, I spent my life in engineering, and in any product, it's not the go to market side, even. I was never part of the go to market, or I have never heard of a lead in my life. I did not know the word "pipeline."

(00:26:26):
All of those things were very remote to me, very. It sounded like such a bizarre motion. But that was on a Thursday, and then, I spent the weekend, because he asked me to, and again, I just follow good people, and do what they tell me to do.

(00:26:42):
So I spent the weekend listening to a ton of podcasts, talking to CMOs, just to even understand what do CMOs do, what do marketing orgs do in B2B companies?

(00:26:51):
Then I ended up deciding to just give it a try, and we did not know if it was going to work. I also don't know if it's going to work forever, but we ended up deciding to give it a try.

(00:27:04):
I think the thing that's convinced me to do it was that, in some ways, I really felt like if, in the early days of the company, finding product market fit is a major block for the company. And then, building a sales organization becomes a major block for the company.

(00:27:19):
I felt like we were at the point, where you have to figure it out to scale. At some point, of every product, people start looking really heavily at brand, whether we think that way, or we don't. When I buy my iPhone, I have no idea how it really is compared to an Android phone. I did not look at the specs. I truly have no idea.

(00:27:39):
So why do I buy an iPhone? I just know it's the thing to buy. B2B products, even the most complex products, people are still people. They still buy it, because brand matters a lot.

(00:27:53):
That was part of what convinced me that this is super important. So if I'm asked to attempt, at least try, because I do think it's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
I love this. I love the detail of the cold room, by the way. Speaking of cold, when we were chatting earlier, you had this really beautiful metaphor of heat. And where heat is within an organization and how it shifts, as the company grows. Can you share that?

Raaz Herzberg (00:28:19):
Yeah, it's exactly that. It's like that in the early, early days when we just started with, I remember, I felt like the heat was in the product kitchen. Because it's like, everybody's waiting to have something, people want to start doing something, right?

(00:28:34):
Then they felt like, "Okay, you start understanding it," and now, the heat moves a bit to the engineering side like, "Okay, build it. Somebody wants it, build it, make it work."

(00:28:44):
Then I felt, "Okay, so we close a couple of deals now," right? We had our first couple of clients. Now you bring in sales, and the heat moves to sales, because they're like, "Okay, we have this thing, now go sell it." And then, the heat starts moving to marketing, in my opinion, where it's like, "Okay, we have a product market fit. Salespeople can sell it, but they're saying, 'Give me more pipeline like, 'Hey, nobody heard of Wiz. Give me more.'"

(00:29:09):
So the heat moves to marketing, at that point. That's kind of, I've always felt like, yeah, in some ways, I also naturally, I guess, follow the heat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):
And I think it's actually more so, that they put the best people in the places that need the most help. Clearly, that was you, when they did that.

(00:30:22):
I asked one of your board members, Shardul Shah, what to ask you. He's a partner at Index Ventures, and here's what he told me, speaking of this move to marketing.

(00:30:32):
He said that when you were in your first board meeting, the Wiz board meeting, presenting marketing, and sharing your plan, and you asked him, "Hey, can you introduce me to all these marketing leaders, so I can learn from them," he basically did the opposite.

(00:30:44):
He's like, "No, I'm going to introduce all my marketing leaders to you, because I think they need to learn from you." Why do you think that's the case?

Raaz Herzberg (00:30:51):
I think Shardul is very kind. I deeply remember that meeting, because funny enough, it was my first board meeting ever. That is a funny thing by itself, because Wiz's board, we have Shardul on our board, we have Doug Leon, and we have Jeff from Insights.

(00:31:09):
It's almost like, it's very humbling to sit down in front of those people, period. And since I decided to take marketing, and I took to the CMO role, this was also my first board meeting ever.

(00:31:23):
And also, it was the meeting where it's, in some ways, I was not that. I was like, "Okay, we took our product manager person, she was never a CMO at any company, and now she has a CMO here." So it was just very, the whole setting was very stressful for me.

(00:31:43):
I just ended up, it was like, I think we just had the meeting two months after I took over marketing. So it was more of an update of, "Hey, those are the changes I've made, and this is how I'm thinking of approaching this, and this is all the things I've done in the past two months."

(00:31:59):
It's funny, because I'm a very non-traditional marketer, just because I really don't know marketing. At this point, I kind of know already, because I've been doing it for two years, and I read a lot, but at that point, I generally did not know. I could not even explain to you how untraditional my approach was, in some ways.

(00:32:16):
I just really did what I thought. I mean, I had a ton to learn about marketing, but what I knew really well was the problem we solved, and I really knew our audience.

(00:32:28):
I myself, I come from security, I come from cloud security, I read all of the right Twitters, and I follow all of the right people on Twitter, and I read all of the right blogs.

(00:32:36):
I know it's funny, I know what matters, I know it's interesting right now, generally because, this is my space. I mean, I live in that space, truly, as a customer. So I was just thinking, "Okay, what are things I could do, to start fixing the problem that mattered most?" And that was, nobody heard of Wiz at that time.

(00:32:59):
Those were just, I was saying, "Okay, I think, in order to do that, I'm willing to take chances, I'll just focus on making a lot of noise." And I think, even in that short time of two months, we saw changes happening already, in some ways.

(00:33:16):
So I think, that what's Shardul meant by that, of course, although I do think he's being very, very kind, and I have learned a lot from many, many marketing people, including my own team, by the way, which is another interesting thing., right?

(00:33:28):
I took over a large team, of people who are marketers, and I'm this person knows nothing about marketing, but will now manage this. So I learned a lot from many marketers, including my own exceptional team.

(00:33:41):
But I think he meant, really looking at it differently, just thinking, "Okay, what is the end to the goal of having the right people hear the right thing about my company, ASAP," versus a ton of traditional aspects, of building pipelines and different things they really did not know how to do, at that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:01):
So following that thread, I'm curious, what is it that you think CMOs mistake, or often do wrong? Why do you think CMOs often don't work out, and they brought in someone like you, with this very fresh perspective? Where do you think folks often go wrong?

Raaz Herzberg (00:34:16):
First of all, I think CMO is a very, very hard role. And also, I think it's a role that is very hard to do without a lot of trust, and without a deep connection to the founding team. Everything you do in marketing is very visible, and you're kind of touching something that matters so deeply to the founding team, and you are the one representing it to the world.

(00:34:43):
So it's very hard to build that trust, and it's very easy to break it, because one bad ad, or something that one of the founding team will say, "Oh, this is not us, this is not what I mean, this is not the right thing," it breaks the trust really easily.

(00:35:00):
And I think it's especially challenging. I mean, I really don't know how somebody that does not come from from a security background could be successful deeply, in this type of a role, for a company like Wiz, because it is really about understanding your customers, and it is really about understanding your product. I think that's very, very hard to gain.

(00:35:21):
So I guess I would say, I think it's the deep trust you need with the founding team, and the really deep connection you need to the product, and to the market. I think both of that, when you come from the outside, in a way, because you are not part of the founding team, and also, you maybe come from outside the market, sometimes, because it's a very technical market or it's a very different domain, then I think it's two really big challenges.

(00:35:47):
I'm not saying you can't come over them, but I think, it's just a very, very hard job. On top of that, it's a very diverse job. When I was a product manager, I managed product managers. I know exactly what they like, what they don't like. That's my audience, I know who to hire. I have the best network, I know every single PM and security around me. It's so different.

(00:36:05):
When you are a marketing leader, you manage performance marketing, which is a numbers game. You manage designers and brand, and then you manage events and field. There's nothing in between those things that is deeply correlated. Sp it's just a very, very challenging and very interesting role.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:23):
This trust point is so interesting, especially based on what you said earlier, where what you want it to do is create noise, take some risks. That's extra hard, if you're not someone that the founding team trusts.

(00:36:35):
Can you share some of the things you did that helped create noise, and get the Wiz name out there, that might inspire folks of like, "Oh, that was really cool, we should do something like that?"

Raaz Herzberg (00:36:43):
Yeah. Another insight I had about marketing in the early days was how different it is from product. As a product manager, I was always, and still believe, it's so important to think really hard about everything you add. Less is more.

(00:36:59):
If you decide to build a feature in a product, then A, you're taking engineering time, which is the most valuable resource in every company, in my opinion, and B, in some ways, you can never take it back. It's complicated your product. Even if one customer likes it and uses it, at least at B2B, you're never going to be able to suddenly take it away.

(00:37:19):
Every new feature you add to your product, you'll have to think about, "Okay, how does it work with that feature?" So it's like making a mistake, adding something to the product that is not the right thing, or that is not truly, truly what your customer needed, even if it's what they asked for. But if it's not what they truly needed, it has a huge cost associated with it.

(00:37:40):
Marketing is quite the opposite, in my opinion. There's no cost to anything, no maintenance to anything, no technical depth, no anything. If tomorrow I post a video on Wiz's LinkedIn page, and I think that video is super funny, and nobody likes that video, nothing happened.

(00:37:54):
Tomorrow, I'll post a different video, no maintenance, bye-bye, forgot it ever happened. In some ways, it dawned on me how opposite those things were, and I was like, "Okay, we have to just use it to our advantage. Let's try everything, let's try everything. I'm trying to make noise."

(00:38:11):
It was right before, when I took over, it was before RSA. RSA is the Super Bowl of security companies. So it's where every vendor's come to showcase, and all of our buyers are there, and you know how those conferences go. You pay for having a space assigned to you, and it's a very expensive space to assign to yourself.

(00:38:33):
And we had the exact same spot we had the year before. I said, "Okay, it's a booth at a conference. I'll just make it the weirdest booth ever, because my goal is just having people look and be like, 'Oh, what is Wiz, right? Because they've never heard of me."

(00:38:48):
Instead of doing a classical cyber booth, I decided to say, "Okay, let's scrap our booth, and do a Wiz of Oz booth," which literally looked like a Wiz of Oz booth, and we had actors, like Dorothy, and all those things hanging around there.

(00:39:03):
It looked nothing like any booths in the show, which is a cybersecurity show, things are red and black, and people with hoodies. And we decided to take a completely opposite approach.

(00:39:14):
In general, I also decided that we're going to take a completely opposite approach was brand. I wanted Wiz's brand to, again, my first motive, stand out.

(00:39:23):
I wanted Wiz to have a very positive, optimistic type of brand. So I went all in on, "Scrap whatever we were doing before, which was dark, and go pink, go bright blue, always go optimistic, and focused on magic, not scaring people from the facts, but magic." And that ended up, and it was scary, don't get me wrong.

(00:39:45):
Half of me was like, I remember feeling so scared walking to the show, to the floor trade. Because I was like, "Is this going to be the most terrible, bizarre? Are people going to be like, 'What is she thinking?'" So I knew it could either be a failure, or a hit.

(00:40:04):
And it ended up, the amount of people that stopped by our booth was five times the amount of people that stopped by the year before. It's the exact same space, the exact same investment, because you invest in the space.

(00:40:16):
But also, ever since we do themed booths, every time, we change themes to keep it fun. At this point, you won't see other cyber companies even doing themes. We were just, "Okay, we'll do whatever it takes to make noise," and this is just one example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:29):
That is an amazing story. You said that other companies now try to do something similar, right? Oh, man. So along these lines, when we were chatting earlier, you shared that you kind of have this mindset of being very okay with failing, that's a core part of you.

(00:40:46):
And it feels like, that comes up again and again in the stories you share, where you just try stuff, and you're okay if it doesn't work out. Can you just talk about that part, and why that's so important?

Raaz Herzberg (00:40:54):
Almost every single thing I've done in my career, in some ways, even before, I never thought I was going to be successful in it. I guess there's a lot of times, it's a lot of talk about being more confident than yourself. I don't know, at least for me, I don't really know if that's a real option, okay?

(00:41:17):
I just know that I'm kind of okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something, and still attempting it. That is the thing that has grown in me where, when I took the job, it was, I was sure, I was sure they got confused, that they offered to take me with him.

(00:41:36):
I was certain that it's going to be like, "Okay, they're going to figure out that I'm not the right fit for that super smart and talented group of people," who have all worked together before, by the way, I was sure they're going to find me out.

(00:41:48):
And I was pretty sure I was going to fail, but I will still take it. I thought I was going to fill the product manager role, too, although I did have the experience.

(00:41:58):
So that also makes it easier to move, in some ways. If I think I'm going to fail with anything, I'm like, "Okay, whatever, I'll try," and I think over time, yeah, it releases you a bit. Sure, I might fail.

(00:42:09):
By the way, I might still fail. It's also fine. Even in my current role, probably not for every scale, it'll make sense for me to do it, but that's also fine. It's still just giving yourself the opportunity to fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:23):
That is really empowering. Is there anything that helps you build that skill, that's not natural to a lot of people, being okay with failure, and leaning into things that they think they'll probably fail at? Where did that come from, for you?

Raaz Herzberg (00:42:34):
Yeah, depending on what you believe in, everything comes from childhood. In some ways, I do think it has to do with, I think the way my mom raised me, my mom really believed that if you're good at something, so that's not where you should invest your energy. She really believed in pushing us to the places where we were less confident in, I guess.

(00:43:00):
I mean, I was a very shy kid. My natural inclination, as a young kid, was to close the door in my room, read a book. I had no interest in meeting other kids or doing sports or nothing, nothing, really super, super shy. And I think, also slightly unsocial by nature, really.

(00:43:18):
But for my mom, she could have been like, "Oh, so she's really good was books and math, so let's focus. Perfect. Let her build up the skill, and be really good with that." But no, she would make me go swimming, and make me go meet other kids.

(00:43:32):
In some ways, I feel, she always used to say that friction is good. If you brush your teeth, and there's a bit of blood somewhere, then you need to brush harder there. It's that idea, that friction is kind of good.

(00:43:46):
If you're good at something already, then you're good at something already. So it's a bit more about learning how to learn, how to push yourself in other areas.

(00:43:54):
I think she put hard work and courage, in some ways, or friction, mostly, above talent. Talent only gets you so far, but that hard work in the friction gets you more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):
That is an awesome story. It's interesting that friction is good circles back to the story you shared about creating hurdles for potential prospects early on, and creating, looking for enthusiasm, where they're filling out these long surveys. How about that?

Raaz Herzberg (00:44:24):
No, it's true. You're right. It shows something. It shows if you do, it's always easier to be in inertia, right?

(00:44:32):
That's why I also say, sometimes, it's like breakup advice I give my girlfriends over the years, where it's like, "Well, if you decide to break up with somebody, it's for sure the right decision, right?"

(00:44:43):
Because not breaking up with somebody is much easier. It's so hard to break up. So that makes it, by default, the right decision. So it's like, yes, where there's friction, it means that you put something extra in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:53):
I want to circle back to marketing/product advice, going back full circle a little bit. So folks that are in product, now that you're in the marketing world, thinking about marketing, what do you think you wish you knew as a product leader, that you think a product leader should be thinking more of, or maybe you miss, that you now see as a marketing leader?

Raaz Herzberg (00:45:12):
Having done products for many years, I really did not understand the criticality of marketing, and even of product marketing. I really did not understand deeply enough that sometimes even gap, between when you're in the product, and you really live inside the product.

(00:45:30):
In the technical domain, you can sometimes not understand how far you are from a common person in your market, or a seller in your market. And marketing, in a lot of ways, bridges that gap.

(00:45:44):
It's like a multiplier, but the further you get away from the core engineer, than product, then in order for the messages to move correctly, they have to be crystal clear. That is something I understood only when looking at it from the other side. If you're on the product side, you can often work with things that are fluffy or blurry or gray, okay?

(00:46:10):
Somebody will ask you, "Can the product do this?" You'll be like, "Yeah, not exactly, but it can do, blah, blah, blah," kind of work around something, right? It doesn't have to be crystal clear, because you can kind of go around things, in a way, that when you try to scale your message, you can't. It gets lost in translation. You have to be crystal clear, black and white.

(00:46:29):
You have to communicate very clearly, especially as an organization scales, you have to communicate very clearly. Suddenly, you're looking at the product org from the outside, in the company that scales fast. And you said, "Whoa, product marketing, in marketing, plays a really important role, in being able to take that message and amplify it."

(00:46:51):
And if you are giving signals that are even a bit gray, fuzzy, then it's not going to work, and you can't expect them to do a good job with it, in some ways. I really, by understanding the go to market perspective, and the user perspective, and the seller perspective, I suddenly understood how things that can look simple on the inside of that side, are very complex, when you cross over to the go to market side. And I think learning the difference is so, so important for product people to understand, that they have to deliver those crystal clear messages about the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):
Is there an example of that, where you're like, "Oh, wow, I thought this was good, but no, nobody understands what we're talking about?"

Raaz Herzberg (00:47:30):
There's so much. I think, for example, in our domain, it's very, almost custom, to talk in a lot of initials, and a lot of things in security are, "Use initials for them." You say CSPM, for Cloud Security Poster Management, and you use a lot of those types of initials, and you keep assuming that the world knows what you mean.

(00:47:51):
But then, when actually looked at things over, from the marketing side, if you ask our product people, engineers, "Where does our product fall in terms of category," it would be CNAP, Cloud Native Application Protection. But if you go over and you look at Google, people are not Googling that word. They're Googling, "Cloud security solution," right?

(00:48:13):
So that's just a simple and silly example, but it's that example, that when you live inside something very technically inside your market, inside domain, you're very remote, sometimes, by accident from the buyer. So a lot of those learnings clicked for me, only once they saw everything from the marketing side.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:32):
You have this concept that you described as a dummy explanation, when someone, you just need it to feel really, really simple. Can you add some color to that?

Raaz Herzberg (00:48:40):
Yes. It's when I, now in marketing, and in everything we write, and everything our team produces in terms of anything, anything written by Wiz, I keep going back to, I don't want us to forget that we are inside our own bubble.

(00:48:56):
We go to work at Wiz every day. Wiz is a cloud security company. We live inside our own bubble, but reminding ourselves that customers don't live in that bubble, they're people in the world. Their life is not Wiz.

(00:49:11):
So every time you write something, I wanted to not assume knowledge about Wiz, or knowledge about the product, or deep knowledge about the market. I'll give just a simple example.

(00:49:23):
Wiz itself is based on, part of the deep innovation that Wiz brought to the market that enabled the scale, was a very high correlated signal that's based on a graph database. So inside Wiz, we have the Wiz graph database, for security.

(00:49:37):
If you write something that says, the Wiz Graph Database, I don't like it. Because why would a common person know it is the Wiz Graph Database, right? So it's making sure that every single thing you say is understandable by anybody. There's no reason to use complex terminology, when you can keep things straight and simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:59):
Easier said than done, but such a good reminder to always be, is there a framework here? Are you just trying to remember, people outside don't understand anything we are talking about, and simplify it further?

(00:50:10):
How do you actually practice that? Because I imagine everyone's, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know all this stuff," but they don't actually do it. Is there any tips there, for how to actually practice this?

Raaz Herzberg (00:50:18):
I constantly remind myself about the bubble. Every time somebody says, "Oh, we haven't changed our color for so long, or a website's headline," a lot of those things, for me, it's like, you are the only one that is sick of it.

(00:50:33):
Your customers are just learning what you put there 10 months ago. You are the only one looking at this thing, day after day after day after day after day. You're actually going to change it, only they're just starting to grasp it, and you're changing it under their feet.

(00:50:46):
It's living in that bubble, and constantly reminding myself, it is a bubble. I'm in that Wiz bubble, right, but my audience is not. So yeah, it's a daily reminder. It's a hard daily reminder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:00):
That is so funny. Okay, just a few more questions. One is, so there's four co-founders of Wiz. That right?

Raaz Herzberg (00:51:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):
What your relationship with them, how has that changed over the years, and over time? I imagine it's very difficult being, not a founder, trying to have a lot of influence on strategy and vision, and all these things.

(00:51:23):
Just, I guess, how has that relationship changed over the years? Anything there that might be helpful to folks, and any advice for people in a similar boat, to work well with founders who are also very product-oriented, and very opinionated about everything?

Raaz Herzberg (00:51:38):
Yeah, I think the Wiz founding team is a truly incredible team. They also have a very unique story. Wiz is actually their second company together. So before Whiz, they founded Adallom, which sold to Microsoft.

(00:51:51):
That's how they all ended up in Microsoft in the first place. Even before that, they all worked together in the Israeli army, so they've known each other for, they've been working together for 30 years, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):
Wow.

Raaz Herzberg (00:52:02):
It's a long, long time. Well, not 30, I made them older, like 20, 22, 22 years. It's a very, very, very unique team, where there is complete trust between the team members. Each has his own clear domain, and that's why decisions are made super fast, super fast, because, the complete trust, and everybody has their clearly own domain.

(00:52:31):
I think the unique thing about Wiz, and I truly think it defines their company's culture to this day, is exactly that they did not have to work hard, to be able to impact strategy, and get a seat at the table.

(00:52:45):
I think that it's open, it's a very open culture, and an open company, that goes back to the beginning of being able to say, "I don't understand."

(00:52:53):
They really believe in employees, and they really believe in giving everybody a chance to have impact. Regardless of title or experience or anything, if you want to drive more impact, you will get the chance. I think it's something I really learned to adore in that team.

(00:53:10):
It's like, they will give their trust to someone, and they will allow you to try. And I think it also causes employees to have a lot of loyalty, because you are given those opportunities, and you are given that chance.

(00:53:24):
It builds a very, very healthy culture, and I think, also, a culture that's very loyal. Everybody feels part of what's being built here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:32):
Incredible. And how many employees are there? How large is Wiz at this point? Just for folks to get a sense, if they want to potentially join Wiz, some day?

Raaz Herzberg (00:53:39):
Around 1,000 through 500, probably.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Okay, awesome. Amazing.

(00:53:47):
Okay, well, potentially final question. I want to take us to Contrarian Corner. I'm curious if there's something you have a very contrarian opinion about, something that you believe, that a lot of other people don't believe?

(00:53:59):
We've already covered a number of things, I think, like that, but is there anything else that comes to mind?

Raaz Herzberg (00:54:03):
It's so funny, because I don't think we've covered anything contrarian.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:05):
Okay.

Raaz Herzberg (00:54:09):
I think one thing is, maybe goes back to what I was talking about before, but it was failing in confidence. I think at least, being a woman in tech, you get talked to a lot about imposter syndrome, and building up her confidence. I actually do think that my approach to it, at least for me, has been just more effective. I won't be able to build that confidence.

(00:54:30):
I do feel like an imposter, and I know there's always those statistics about many people feeling that way. So I think, maybe just, "Let's embrace it. I feel like an imposter, you feel like an imposter, everybody feels like an imposter," It's kind of, maybe embrace it, but don't let that stop you from making a decision.

(00:54:49):
Maybe they will find out you're an imposter, maybe let them find out. It's fine. If you think about trying to go to an interview for a company, and you start thinking, "Oh no, I won't get accepted, they won't take me," perfect.

(00:55:03):
Let them not accept you. You think you're not good enough? Perfect. That's on them, to not accept you, right? Give yourself that opportunity.

(00:55:10):
And I think, for me, maybe less talking about the imposter syndrome, more talking about just, "Okay, but ignore it. You will never know your limit if you don't try."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
The best advice I've heard along these lines, which is basically what you're saying, is that when you take on a new role, you actually are an imposter. You've never done this before, and that's okay, and that's very normal.

(00:55:32):
Most people in a new role, when they're promoted, given a big opportunity, yeah, you are an imposter in many ways, but that's okay. And that's exactly what you're saying.

Raaz Herzberg (00:55:39):
I never heard it, but I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:42):
Raaz, is there anything else you wanted to share, anything else that we haven't touched on, that you think might be helpful to folks, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Raaz Herzberg (00:55:49):
I deeply, deeply believe that we're doing something super special in Wiz, and I think the company is in such an interesting place of hyperscaling, but still keeping that authentic, and I think, flat and enabling culture.

(00:56:02):
I think there's literally interesting opportunities across every domain. So yeah, just to say that we are always hiring for great people, trying to make an impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
Are there any roles or areas you're specifically most focused on hiring now, in case folks are listening, you're like, "Oh, shit, I'm going to apply?"

Raaz Herzberg (00:56:19):
Truly, the beauty of hypersaling is, we are hiring across everything, but also, if you feel super strongly about joining, and you don't find the right role, we'd still love to talk to you. There's many, many things for passionate people to do here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:34):
Awesome. We'll link to the Career page in the show notes. And with that, Raaz, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Raaz Herzberg (00:56:41):
I'm ready, I hope.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:43):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Raaz Herzberg (00:56:48):
So I focus like it was on the product side of things. We mentioned the heat in the kitchen. Actually, one of my most favorite business books, and I've read a lot of them, is probably Setting the Table, by Danny Meyer, which is, he owns Shake Shack, and a chain of really great restaurants in New York.

(00:57:07):
And it's such an interesting business perspective, from a different domain, than obviously tech or SaaS. But there's so many applicable lessons there, from the deep connection to hosting, focusing and obsessing over your customer. Shake Shack, unlike other chains, where they optimize for you not to sit down, they optimize for you to sit down there. It's a very, very unique culture and unique vision, and I've learned a lot. Some of the most memorable lessons come from his management thoughts.

(00:57:39):
Imagine huge chains, but also very high-end restaurants. I think it's a very, very inspiring, inspiring book, and different, just different from my domain, but very applicable in my domain, as well.

(00:57:50):
And then, a second book I really like, I read it early on in Wiz, and so did the entire founding team, I think, the book by Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, No Rules Rules, which also, I think, talks very clearly. Netflix has a super unique culture and story, right?

(00:58:11):
Talk about pivots, they sold cassettes over mail, and somehow pivoted to what it is today. That's an insane story. Think about pivoting from a tech company, to a company that has production to do, and produces reality TV. Talk about the type of culture you would need to truly pivot, I think it's a super interesting read for anybody thinking about putting strong culture in place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
I'm going to call an audible, and ask about marketing, specifically. You said that early on, you read some marketing books, and listened to marketing podcasts. Is there anything else that you recall was very helpful, in helping you ramp up in this world, and do marketing?

Raaz Herzberg (00:58:48):
Honestly, I think, at the end, for me, I just ended up saying, "What are the companies I feel do things really well? What are the brands I love, and what do I love about them?"

(00:59:04):
And then, really obsessing about, what did they do, what are their team doings? And then, also, obsessing about the people behind them. For example, I think Gong does an amazing job in marketing, for a B2B product.

(00:59:22):
So it was like, "Okay, so what are all the things Gong did?" Then I would look up every single talk their CMO gave. So it's like, I always backed up into it. I did not care if it's a security company or not a security company.

(00:59:35):
I actually don't like the way most security companies market things. It's mostly by frightening and fear, and I don't like it. For me, it was just looking at brands I love, and then backtracking from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):
I love that. We have the CPO of Gong and co-founder coming on the podcast very soon, so I'll ask him about this.

Raaz Herzberg (00:59:53):
Oh, cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):
All right, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Raaz Herzberg (00:59:59):
Honestly, I hardly, hardly watch anything. I think The Wire is the best show ever created.

(01:00:05):
I will take that fight with anybody. But yeah, I haven't really watched anything super recent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:11):
The only problem with the Wire is it's so long to watch. I've watched, I've seen it, I love it, but it's a large commitment. It's an hour times 22 episodes times, I think, five seasons, but worth it.

Raaz Herzberg (01:00:22):
Worth it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:24):
Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?

Raaz Herzberg (01:00:28):
It's a funny question, in the world we live in, where there's just so many similar things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):
That's why. Which one should we pay attention to? That's the question.

Raaz Herzberg (01:00:36):
I'll answer a pretty random answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):
Yeah, okay.

Raaz Herzberg (01:00:38):
Recently, I always go around with a notebook and a pen, still that type of person. I mean, I constantly walk around with them, across office rooms, blah, blah blah, and I always care deeply about the notebook and the pen.

(01:00:50):
I'm a very picky person. I pick pens, I pick notebooks, and I often lose my pens, which is sad. I recently bought this cute something, it's very geeky, like, a pen holder for a notebook. I did not know they existed.

(01:01:04):
It's a very nice feature. It's small, magnetic, and it claps into your notebook, and then you can put the pen in it. Really nice feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):
How does one find this? Is there a brand, or a name, or something?

Raaz Herzberg (01:01:14):
I'll send you a link, but if you look, "notebook pen holder," you'll find a ton.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):
Okay, cool. We'll link to in the show notes, whatever one you recommend.

(01:01:22):
Just a couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful, in work or in life?

Raaz Herzberg (01:01:29):
I think, keeping it simple. If you start feeling like something is too complex, or an answer is too complex, or something you're building in the product is too complex probably, or something in your life feels too complex, probably, it does mean something. But sometimes, you just have to maybe take two steps back, leave it there, until you come back to it again, and you find a simple way out.

(01:01:50):
Whether it's a private feature or anything, I feel like, if something starts getting too complex, and you don't know how to design it, or how to find end from start, it does mean it's not the right solution. It's too complex, it's not the right solution, but sometimes, I take two steps back, and you find it applicable to anything in life, almost.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):
Reminds me of the story when you were trying to sell the initial version of Wiz/beyond whatever it was called, early on, and it was just too complicated. No one understood what the hell's going on, and so I love how that circles back.

(01:02:20):
Final question. I know you can't talk too much about this, but I'm also just curious what you're able to share. As I said, allegedly, a company whose name rhymes with Loogle, wanted to buy you guys for many billions, and you all decided to decline that, and stay private. Anything you could share there, about maybe why you decided to do that, if that was true at all?

Raaz Herzberg (01:02:40):
Yeah, I mean, I can't address any specific offers. Obviously, Wiz over the years has gotten many acquisition offers. I can share, that I think for us, us being the founding team, the employees, the customers, the board, staying on an independent path, we all really believe that Wiz can become one of the biggest security companies in the world.

(01:03:06):
When you look at Wiz today, and I mean, we spoke about the unconventional growth, when you think about it, in some ways, Wiz addresses the biggest growing market of security. Cloud security, cloud is the fastest growing, cloud is such a fast-growing market. Cloud grows 20, 30%, year over year.

(01:03:25):
We feel like everything is in the cloud, but in reality, by estimation, only 20%, 15 to 20% of the infra today, is in cloud. It's a really, really fast-growing state, in a fast-growing market. And security by nature is a bit of a market of leaders.

(01:03:42):
I mean, it's a bit like buying insurance for something. You want to buy it from the best, from the leader in this domain. And today, Wiz really is that leader, because it's a new space. Wiz is considered, I think, in many ways, and that is also what makes marketing and brand, not just marketing, but truly, brand so important.

(01:04:01):
Wiz is considered, I think, the cloud security company, in a lot of ways. Still, of course, it's our to lose. There's a ton of work ahead of us, but that is a huge opportunity in front of us, becoming the cloud security company. And I think nobody thinks we are anywhere near ready to give it up, in a way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):
I totally understand that, and again, Wiz is hiring, in case you are inspired by what you're hearing.

(01:04:27):
Raaz, this was incredible. I'm so happy that you did this. Thank you so much for being here.

(01:04:32):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out, and maybe follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Raaz Herzberg (01:04:37):
Find me on LinkedIn, and yeah, no apply. We'd love great people who are learners, which I think is what this podcast is all about. So definitely, the right place to find the right people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:48):
Awesome. Raaz, thank you so much.

Raaz Herzberg (01:04:49):
Thank you so much for having me.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
When clients come to you, what is the biggest gap they have that is keeping them from being successful as leaders?

Rachel Lockett (00:00:06):
Most leaders, especially technical leaders, assume they have to have all the answers. People have climbed the ladder because they've been dependable, reliable, the smartest person in the room. But great leaders know that when you try to advise and have the answer all the time, you're not actually equipping your team to go solve the hard problems. You're training your team to come to you with all of the hard problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
Difficult conversations are difficult. How do we help people make them less difficult?

Rachel Lockett (00:00:32):
We operate in tech. We're supposed to give all of ourselves, all of our time, all of our energy to this endeavor, and it's purely logical. That's not at all true. It's completely emotional. Professionals have feelings. People, when they want to have a conflict, they come in ready to prove their point. There's a misguided view that the goal is to convince the other person that what they're doing is wrong. Actually, the goal of any conflict is to create mutual understanding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Talk about what you've learned about helping leaders in tech avoid burnout.

Rachel Lockett (00:01:01):
When people are in their gifts and their strengths, they have more energy. We all have more energy when we're operating from the things we naturally are good at. It's no one else's job to help you live in your gifts. What I notice in big companies is people are often annoyed or frustrated with their management for not making their job more interesting. No, your manager's job is to help you perform in the job you are hired to do. It's your job to navigate your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:26):
The power of this is this makes your life so much better.

Rachel Lockett (00:01:28):
Lenny, let's try it. So, I want you to tell me a challenge, something that you're struggling with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:34):
The main thing I struggle with these days is just... Today, my guest is Rachel Lockett, an executive coach and former longtime HR leader at Pinterest and at Stripe. She works with CEOs, and founders, and leaders at tech companies on both ways that they are, emotional and positive intelligence, resilience and courage, and what they do, setting vision and strategy, prioritizing, and building trusted and accountable teams. She's someone I've heard a lot about over the years from other podcast guests, and this conversation is powerful. It's jam-packed with advice, and tips, and frameworks that'll make you a better leader and also a better person. We even do a couple live coaching sessions to demonstrate some of Rachel's approaches. And as you'll see, I had a number of epiphanies during this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

1.3%, it's a small number, but in the right context, it's a powerful one. Stripe processed just over $1.4 trillion last year. That figure works out to be about 1.3% of global GDP. It's a lot, but it's also just 1.3%. Stripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest-growing enterprises, including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100. There's a reason I've had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company. They know how to build great products that scale and that people love.

(00:03:27):
Stripe is also a lot more than just payments. They've also got a category-leading billing solution and a highly-optimized checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Enterprises like Atlassian, Figma, and Urban use Stripe to create fully branded and customized checkout pages with access to more than 125 global payment methods.

(00:04:59):
Rachel, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Rachel Lockett (00:05:03):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I am honored to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
I'm honored to have you here. I was going to start with a different question, but we were chatting ahead of this conversation and I always like to ask guests, what do you want people to get out of this conversation? And I loved your answer, so I just want you to share this. So, let me just ask you, what are you hoping people get out of the conversation we're about to have?

Rachel Lockett (00:05:23):
Genuinely, I hope that your listeners take away that the human side of business building is incredibly fun and impactful and that it's easy to do. They can do it with simple tools. So, I'm hopeful that through this conversation, heads of product, heads of engineering, founders walk away feeling more empowered and more motivated to attune to the people around them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:47):
So, what I'm hearing is just if you're struggling with the human side of building a product, building a team, building a company, there are answers. You can do it.

Rachel Lockett (00:05:56):
Yes, exactly. It is achievable, and it's actually most natural. Leaders want to care about the people they work with. They want to empower those around them. But sometimes the busyness of our world gets in the way and the urgency of the litany of things to do distracts you from the people in front of you. And actually, if you really understand the talent around you and you create an environment where they can be successful, your business will thrive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:22):
I think the hardest part of this for people is just there's the knowing this can be helped with. The other is just being vulnerable enough to seek help and to take this on because it's so hard. Just like, "Oh, maybe I'm not a great manager." That doesn't feel good.

Rachel Lockett (00:06:37):
Yeah, that's true. I mean, it's vulnerable to seek help, but I think your audience, I know to be incredibly committed to growth. I hear of people who come on your podcast and they've spent decades focused on self-improvement. And I actually want to tell you a story about one of my clients who loves your podcast, and I was talking to him last week. He's a client I've seen for 10 years, and he's a person who exemplifies a commitment to personal growth.

(00:07:08):
I started working with him when he was a frontline engineering manager at Coinbase, and we talked about who he is, what his strengths are, and his bigger picture why. And he talked about this dream of creating a global movement one day. He was really focused on building community, and he thought the path for creating possibility in the world around him was creating a strong community around him. And he continually worked on his leadership capacity. And over the 10 years, at some point, he created a tattoo on his arm that's a sun with a redwood grove around it that reminded him of his core strengths and his purpose. And today, guess what he's doing, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):
Killing it.

Rachel Lockett (00:08:00):
He's not only killing it-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:02):
[inaudible 00:08:02] vision.

Rachel Lockett (00:08:02):
... but he's running a community, a global community for Coinbase called Base and the Base app.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
Oh, wow.

Rachel Lockett (00:08:08):
It's the largest Ethereum L2 in the world, and it's a community of creators and developers, and he's having a great time. He's having more fun than ever. And so, I think for the people who are committed to excellence and impact, recognizing that if they lean into their gifts and they get back into their purpose, they can have more fun while having an impact on the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
This story reminds me of just why I love these sorts of conversations because the sort of stuff we're going to be talking about, and we'll get into it right after this final preamble, is stuff that's usually locked away in these very small rooms, are only accessible to folks with a bunch of money. This is stuff people pay tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars for over the course of their career. And I just love the idea of sharing all this with everyone to help all learn from the stuff that you've learned from all these people you've worked with. So, I'm really excited to be digging into stuff. The first thing I want to dive into, I actually asked you, when clients come to you, what is the biggest gap they have that is keeping them from being successful as leaders? And you told me it's essentially knowing when to coach versus knowing when to just tell people what to do and learning to coach. Talk about what you see there, why this is so important, and how you help people develop the skill.

Rachel Lockett (00:09:24):
I think that most leaders, especially technical leaders, assume they have to have all the answers. People have climbed the ladder in whatever realm they're in because they've been dependable, reliable, the smartest person in the room. But when you're leading a quickly-scaling company, you quickly have less context than the people you're around. And the way you were operating before doesn't work because you don't have the ability to wrap your arms around every problem in a deep way. So, I've seen leaders at every phase from frontline managers up to running an 8,000-person company struggle with knowing when do I have to have the answer, and when I don't have the answer, what options do I have?

(00:10:12):
But great leaders know that when you try to advise and have the answer all the time, you're not actually equipping your team to go solve the hard problems. You're training your team to come to you with all of the hard problems. And coaching is a different way. It's an alternative path that unlocks brilliance in your team and is way more motivating for the people around you. So, coaching is actually a learnable skill, obviously, because there's tons of coaches around Silicon Valley, but you don't have to coach in the same way that an executive coaches. You can shift your energy into curiosity when someone brings you a hard problem to solve, and create space to get curious, and help them solve their own problem.

(00:10:59):
So, obviously, sometimes advising is the right path. If there's an urgent issue, the person coming to you doesn't have the skill they need, that's a time to advise and help. But leaders over-rotate, assuming the people that they've hired who are experts in their domain need them to solve the problem. So, I think it's useful for your listeners to actually know that coaching's an alternative, and I can help them learn some basic skills around this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):
Okay. I'd love to learn those skills. What this makes me think about is there's this famous Harvard Business Review piece. I don't know. It's like 30 years ago maybe about the monkey on the back. You know this piece, where it's-

Rachel Lockett (00:11:42):
Say more. I think I do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:44):
Okay, we'll link to it. It's this idea that as a leader, people always just coming to you trying to give you their monkey that's sitting on their back. And they're like, "Hey, this monkey is causing me all this problem. I don't know what to do. But this monkey, here you go. You take it, and feed it, and help it, figure out what it needs." And the role of a leader is to keep the monkey on the back of the person and help them figure out how to solve the problem, exactly what you're describing.

Rachel Lockett (00:12:04):
Yeah, that's a great analogy. I love that. I think leaders make things up when they don't have answers sometimes. A person comes to you with a problem and you just want to help. But the best way to help is actually doing something that most leaders don't do well. It's attuning to what is the context? What does this person need? What are they blocked on? And ask them with those questions so that they can solve their own problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:32):
Let's talk about how to get better at this. But first of all, when you said, "When is it actually smart to just tell them what to do?" You said it's when they don't have the skills to do it. Is there any other kind of heuristics of like, okay, just tell them what to do in these cases?

Rachel Lockett (00:12:43):
Yeah, it's an urgent issue and you actually have an answer that you want to drive. So, don't coach and make it a game. You want your person on your team to guess what's in your mind. That's not a good time to coach. You have something you absolutely want them to do. You know the right answer. You want them to be motivated to go do it. Advise them. Help them see the path. But most leaders over-index on that solution. So, I want to share. Maybe Lenny, I can teach you two skills that I think are the basics of leader coaching-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:43):
Let's do it. I'd love that.

Rachel Lockett (00:13:21):
... that you can use in your own life tonight with your wife-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:24):
She's going to love this.

Rachel Lockett (00:13:25):
... or anyone you operate with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:25):
Let's do it.

Rachel Lockett (00:13:27):
And hopefully, your listeners can use them too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:30):
Let's do it.

Rachel Lockett (00:13:31):
Okay. So, the first skill is active listening. And Lenny, you're probably a good listener because this is what you do for a living is you listen to the people who come on your podcast. But I don't know if you've seen Fight Club. There's a quote, "Most people aren't listening. They're just waiting for their turn to talk."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):
Absolute-

Rachel Lockett (00:13:49):
This is rampant in tech. And great leaders flip that script and tune in. They're the kinds of leaders who walk into a room, and they can see the elephants. They can name them. They can ask the hard questions to get people collaborating. So, there's actually three levels to listening. So, the first level listening, level one is internal. Let's say you're talking to me about a problem. I'm thinking about the implications of that problem on me. I'm completely distracted with my own inner dialogue. That's level one. Most people go through their world rushed and in level one. Level two listening is focused. So, you're talking to me, and I can repeat back what you're saying. So, I am listening to the words you're describing, and that's typically what happens in a good one-on-one. We're problem solving together and focused on your words.

(00:14:46):
Level three listening is global listening. So, that's what I'm hearing beneath the words. I'm hearing what you're communicating, not just what you're saying. I see your body language. I notice your tone of voice. I know the context around what you're talking about, and I can reflect back more insight about what's happening than you're aware of because I'm understanding everything you're communicating. So, dropping into level three listening is what great leaders do when they're influencing, when they're selling, when they're pitching a vision, and definitely when they're coaching. So, do you want to try it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):
Let's do it.

Rachel Lockett (00:15:25):
Okay. How about this? I'll demonstrate some level three listening. I'm going to ask you a question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:30):
Okay. Uh-oh.

Rachel Lockett (00:15:32):
You told me earlier, you're a father.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:34):
Yeah.

Rachel Lockett (00:15:35):
What is it like to be a dad?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:38):
Wow. What is it like to be a dad? It's amazing. It's like the most amazing thing I've ever done in many ways. I love it so much. It's also quite challenging at times dealing with setting boundaries and knowing when to just let him do the thing he's really excited about or just saying, "no," and just letting him cry for a while. That's something I've been dealing with recently, but it's like everything people tell you it is basically in every way except the joy is so much higher, so much higher than you hear from other people because people always talk about all the downsides, all the pain and challenges.

Rachel Lockett (00:16:15):
Yeah, and I see you when you talk about being a father, initially, I saw you really squirm in your chair. Well, this is a big question. And you looked up and down and kind of avoided my eye contact at first because my sense is you love being a dad, and it's so challenging. It's so tiring. And I'm hearing both of that in your answer. The high joy and the discomfort in having to sleep train, and having to disappoint, and navigating challenging behavior.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):
Nailed it. That was very nice to hear. Clearly, you listened to everything I said and that was a really good example of active listening.

Rachel Lockett (00:16:59):
What does it feel like to be seen that way?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):
It feels really nice. It feels really nice to be heard. And it's not just like you're repeating back my words. It's here's what I got out of the level below what you're saying, and the gist, and the bigger picture.

Rachel Lockett (00:17:14):
Yeah, there's some emotional connection when you listen actively, and that took less than a minute. So, what I want to invite listeners to understand is that active listening doesn't mean you're setting up an hour coaching session with every person on your team. No one has time for that. But even in the time you're already spending, just focusing on the other person in a way that is novel and really gives them your full attention so you can see their feelings under what they're saying goes a long way to motivating your team and helping them understand what's actually happening under the surface in this situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):
I think there's just so much power in different words, repeating back what they said. That's almost implied in what you're describing. It sounds like... So, I don't know, like a trick they'll see through. But knowing that you're listening to me and you're going to show me active listening, it still feels really nice to just hear back what I said. There's a lot of power in that and it's subtle.

Rachel Lockett (00:18:10):
Yeah. Great. Yeah, there's an element of synthesizing what I'm hearing verbally. That's the focused listening part, and then, mirroring back the emotions that I'm noticing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):
The emotions.

Rachel Lockett (00:18:19):
And even things that I'm guessing, and I can say, "Is that right?" And you can say, "No, actually, I'm not conflicted about the challenges of being a dad. I just am so joyful." And then, now, I understand where you're coming from and so do you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):
Awesome. Okay, so this is a core skill of coaching is active listening.

Rachel Lockett (00:18:37):
Yes. So, that's listening. Second skill, powerful questions. So, asking powerful questions means I'm curious about what's really going on, and there's not one right answer. So, a powerful question helps you gain insight and it takes you to a new solution set you didn't have before. But it's not me leading the witness. I'm not trying to guide you to a specific answer. That wouldn't be a powerful question. So, something that I like to equip leaders with is four kinds of questions that you can ask to unlock insight.

(00:19:17):
So, the first kind is I use a GROW model. So, the GROW model just is four different categories of kinds of powerful questions. So, the G in grow is goal. So, what does success look like? What's the outcome that you want to have? Any question that's around defining the best case scenario. The R in the GROW model is about your current reality. Where are you stuck? What are your current challenges? What have you tried? The O is about your options. So, let's expand the opportunities that you can understand of the choices you have in front of you. What are the various paths you could take? And the W in the GROW model is the way forward. What are you going to do next? So, this sounds simple, and it is simple if you take the time and space to listen carefully and ask any of these questions. The people on your team will appreciate the space and time to unlock an option that they didn't think of before and walk away with a concrete next step.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
So, just to reflect back what you're saying, so someone comes to you with a monkey on their back. Here's a problem I'm trying to solve. This percent of my team is just not doing something right or this feature isn't working, something like that. So, first of all, it's listen, be very active in your listening. Reflect back what you're hearing, their emotions. And then, ask them questions around what does success look like for this? What is the goal? What is the goal? What does success look like for the thing you're trying to do here? What does success look like? Two is just what's today's reality? What's happening today? Then, options. Here's options that you think exist. So, this is you asking them what are the options?

Rachel Lockett (00:21:01):
Yeah, what are your paths forward? What could you do next?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):
What could you do next? And then, this is organic. So, it's not just like one, two, three, four, I imagine.

Rachel Lockett (00:21:10):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
But the final step is just, okay, what's the way forward? What do you want to do?

Rachel Lockett (00:21:14):
That's exactly right. And you don't have to do it in this order. These are just four kinds of questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:14):
I see.

Rachel Lockett (00:21:19):
So, you might come and someone's super clear about their outcome. You know that. You don't need to spend any time asking them questions about that. Maybe you just want to really dig in on where are they stuck? And once they start talking about their reality and where they're stuck, then they realize, oh, I'm stuck because my cross-functional partner is blocking me, and I don't have any relationship with them. I need to go meet with them actually and just have a breakthrough conversation, tell them where I'm stuck. So, sometimes talking this out loud, just creating that space for them is going to help them tremendously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
And there's kind of an implication here that the person often knows the answer or can come to the answer, and they just need a little bit of nudge to get there.

Rachel Lockett (00:21:56):
Yeah, this is definitely you want to coach when you think the person you're talking to has the right context and can solve their own problem. That's a premise of coaching. You wouldn't coach if someone needs your guidance and comes to you and says, "Hey, I'm trying to take my company public. You took your company public. Can you tell me exactly the steps you took to get there?" Not a good time to coach.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):
This begs the question, what if they just come to a terrible conclusion and you're just like... Advice on when to actually just like, "What about this instead?"

Rachel Lockett (00:22:30):
Yeah, okay. I think that's great. So, if you have a really strong negative reaction to what they're sharing, of course it doesn't behoove anyone to hide that. I think you get curious. "Hey, help me understand how you came to that conclusion because here's my reaction to that." So, you're honest, but you're also curious. So, coaching in a manager or a leader context is not the same as in an executive coaching conversation. You're managing this person. You're responsible for their outcomes. You're not setting up an hour-long coaching session, you're just using coaching as an additional tool in your toolkit from advising. And you're creating more space, maybe 15% more space in your one-on-ones, in your meetings for open-ended questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:14):
I love this phrase, help me understand. One of my managers used to be really good at this, just like... You could tell, he's like, "Help me understand this part of your thinking."

Rachel Lockett (00:23:22):
Yeah. And the other thing that does when you're curious and you don't just shut down someone's idea, is you're helping them think. You're not helping them realize they're going to screw it up unless they come to you for advice. You're helping equip them with the right questions to ask and the right skepticism to have. And so, it's always useful to be in conversation when someone who reports to you has a different worldview than you do. There's some reason they came up with this great idea that you think is a terrible idea. And actually, that's where the learning happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):
And you may actually be wrong and you may realize, okay, they actually have the better solution. I get it now.

Rachel Lockett (00:24:01):
Yeah. This actually happens to me all the time in talent conversations. Because I have a background in being an HR business partner, and I'm working with CEOs and they're thinking about building their leadership team. And I want everyone to have a very rigorous stance on their talent because if you have an A plus squad, you're going to do great things in the world. And sometimes, they come up with an idea to performance manage someone who's clearly not working in the role, but think, oh, maybe I'll wait six months, and then, we'll have a conversation. I have a strong point of view. I'm not going to let that slide, but I'm going to say, "Help me understand why that is a good idea," and I'm going to press on that. And if they don't come to an idea that I'm aligned with, I'm going to share openly my perspective while still empowering them to solve their own problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:49):
To close the loop on this piece of advice, is there an example you could share to make this super concrete for folks?

Rachel Lockett (00:24:55):
Well, I'm going to give you an example of a client, I'm going to call him Jeff, who runs an AI company. And he was essentially playing the role of the head of product also. And he had a growing number of engineers and designers, and his customer base was growing rapidly. And he started to feel completely overwhelmed. So, he came to me and we started coaching together. And soon, he realized that he was the blocker on every decision, every business decision, every product decision. And he was resenting it. He wanted his team to take more ownership. But with some coaching, he realized he was training his team to come to him with every decision because he had always operated that way. So, he decided to create squads and have small pods of engineers, product leaders, and designers focus on subsets of the team. Very normal as you have a small startup scaling. But he didn't have an engineering manager and a product leader for every one of them.

(00:26:00):
So, this was a little bit earlier than he was equipped for because he did it out of necessity. And he also realized he needed to create some behavior change for the way he was interacting with that tech lead on each project so that they would take more ownership. So, we really invested in this idea of I'm going to start to set the system up so we have a product review every two weeks, they each have clear KPIs they're driving to that we co-design, and for this next quarter, I'm shifting from the role of deciding on everything to coaching. I'm going to really ask good questions in our check-ins. I'm going to align to the KPIs, ask how things are going, ask where they're stuck. And I just had a session with him last week. It's amazing to see him because he's so much more energized. He said, "The squads are moving so much faster. The teams feel more empowered and motivated." And he has time to pick his head up and plan for 2026...

Rachel Lockett (00:27:01):
And he has time to pick his head up and plan for 2026, and spend his time and his gifts. Which are product, vision and strategy. So that's more of a global example of what results from leaders shifting from the mode of solving every problem to coaching.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):
That's such a great example of just the power of this, this makes your life so much better. Because other people can start picking up the slack and not come to you for everything. And it's like, listen better, ask a few powerful questions and so much improves, so much changes.

Rachel Lockett (00:27:35):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):
Everyone around you gets better.

Rachel Lockett (00:27:37):
Lenny, let's try it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):
Okay, let's try it.

Rachel Lockett (00:27:38):
So I want you to tell me a challenge. It could be a personal challenge, a professional challenge. Just bottom line, something that you're struggling with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:51):
Whoa. The main thing I struggle with these days is just endless work. I feel like this newsletter, I started this newsletter six, seven years ago at this point, and originally it was like, I'm just going to build this chill newsletter, do this on the side. Just kind of chill out for a while. And now it's just like, it just grows. I couldn't help but make it more awesome and bigger and have this podcast now and other stuff I got going on. So it's always this.

(00:28:18):
So I'm in a world now where it's just this ... the way I think about it is the Indiana Jones boulder is constantly in my back rearview mirror just coming at me. Because I need to get a newsletter post out, get podcast episodes out, do all the things associated with that. I'm also just in the middle of ... I have this large Slack community at Twitter and LinkedIn, so I'm just constantly being barraged with small little asks and things and all these little things that never ... it's hard to just ignore and say no to. So what I struggle with just endless work. I joke that be careful working for yourself if your boss is a workaholic.

Rachel Lockett (00:28:53):
I totally relate to that. Okay, so I'm hearing noise, barrage of needs and just constant requests of you online, in your work life. There's always something that you need to be doing. And you designed it that way yourself. So you're kind of aware of, I had this one intention of a path to freedom, insight. I imagine the newsletter was a fun passion project. And you couldn't help but make it this all-consuming full-time job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
That's right. Let me just add, it's like in so many ways the most awesome thing I could ever imagine doing also and extremely fulfilling. And I couldn't think of anything better I'd rather be doing.

Rachel Lockett (00:29:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:36):
So I think that's an important element.

Rachel Lockett (00:29:38):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):
It's this Indiana Jones boulder constantly chasing me.

Rachel Lockett (00:29:41):
Yeah, I can feel the gratitude and the resonance with what you get to do every day. And yet I hear you questioning, why does it have to feel like I'm fighting for my life while I'm doing this thing I love?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):
That's one way to put it, yeah. This boulder is squishing me.

Rachel Lockett (00:30:00):
I mean, the Indiana Jones boulder is coming for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:01):
Oh man.

Rachel Lockett (00:30:02):
That's a fight or flight instinct we all have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
That's true. That's true.

Rachel Lockett (00:30:05):
Okay, so thank you for being vulnerable enough to share that with your listeners and with me. I want to ask you, what would dream state look like? So let's say in six months you're still running this beautiful business that you've created. And you feel differently. What is happening?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:33):
What I imagine is the same thing mostly, just much more free time. So more time to experiment and play with other things. And at the same time, the newsletter continues to be awesome and high quality, the podcast continues to be awesome and high quality. So it's continuing to put out the same high quality stuff, just more free time, less ... the boulders may be smaller.

Rachel Lockett (00:30:56):
Yeah, okay. So what does free time enable for you? When you think about ... I hear your deep commitment to quality products and quality output. But this longing to feel a little bit more playful or flexible with those parts that are essential to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:17):
Very practically, it's time to play around with AI tools. Just explore and just kind of tinker. Versus, okay, all the time I have, I need to focus on the newsletter, make it better for next week. Oh, it's coming out, here's things I got to do. Oh, this podcast, got to prep for that, got to edit this thing. So it's just time to tinker and explore and just like that kind of stuff.

Rachel Lockett (00:31:37):
That makes sense. And what's important about exploring and tinkering to you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:42):
Because in the work I do, I need to stay ahead on where things are going. I can't just sit around and pontificate from a cloud. I need to really understand how things work, what's working, what's not, what's real, what's not. So being on the ground as much as I can with what's actually going on versus just putting out content.

Rachel Lockett (00:31:59):
That makes sense. Your voice is moving really fast. I kind of hear you feeling behind, even in the way you're describing what you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:06):
A good [inaudible 00:32:09] listening.

Rachel Lockett (00:32:10):
What's interesting to me is when you're talking about exploring and tinkering, when you first said it, you said it in kind of a spacious way. It's fun to explore and tinker. You're deeply naturally curious. You find new insights. But then I also heard you say, "And it's a way to stay ahead, I have to do it in order to feel like I'm informed." So what do you make of that difference?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:37):
Yeah. Yeah. Those are two sides of the coin. There's another element of ... I guess let me answer that question. I think those are both true, I don't know. The reason I got into this is because it was so fun and so interesting. Just like, here's what's happening, here's what the future-

Rachel Lockett (00:32:53):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):
Here's advice, here's ways to improve in the work that you do. So I still love it. It's just I have less time to do that part and more it's just the machine of the treadmill of content, content, content. There's also just spending more ... I didn't even mention this. But just spending more time with my son and my wife, that would be really great just to have more freedom to go do stuff. Which we have a lot of that, but more is great.

Rachel Lockett (00:33:16):
That makes sense. Okay, so the goal that I hear is not so dramatically different from today. It's that you hold on to this high quality output, but you have space for exploring and tinkering. And for spending quality time with the people you love most.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:33):
Yes. One way I'm thinking about as you reflect that back is 25% more free time while everything else continues to be awesome. And the challenge I run into is I sometimes get that extra time and then I fill it with more projects and opportunities. That's the problem right there.

Rachel Lockett (00:33:50):
Yeah, there's that inertia of moving fast, taking advantage of the moment that's coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:54):
Yeah, yeah.

Rachel Lockett (00:33:54):
So that's a perfect shift into, what are your current ways of operating that get in the way of having that 25% of free time?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:03):
It's just agreeing to more things. Just like, oh look, I'm kind of free right now. Oh, okay, let's do this talk here. Let's agree to this thing here. So it's just once I feel freedom, I'm like, "Okay, I could do that other thing." And so I commit to more stuff.

Rachel Lockett (00:34:18):
Yeah. And how is that commitment to saying yes to things that come at you serving you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
Not great.

Rachel Lockett (00:34:27):
Well, it's serving you in some ways. You're doing it for a reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
Yeah.

Rachel Lockett (00:34:31):
What benefit does it have to you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):
Well, it depends on the thing. I actually have a rule of never doing a talk or going on another podcast or going to events really, because I find I never really get much out of it, and it distracts me from the stuff I could be doing. So I've set up a lot of policies of just turning down things that don't serve me. But I still crumble and say yes to stuff.

Rachel Lockett (00:34:33):
Yeah, that's smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
So to your point, there's value here and there when I take on more work. And then I end up overworked again.

Rachel Lockett (00:35:04):
Yeah, I'm hearing there's just a pattern, it's like a reflexive pattern of even though you set a rule for yourself to say no to certain things and you seem proud of that boundary. You naturally break it or you fall into filling it with other things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:16):
That's right. Exactly.

Rachel Lockett (00:35:18):
Okay. So you're stuck in this kind of addiction to doing more and signing up for more, which is so normal in our world, and probably most listeners can relate to that. That's kind of the soup we swim in. So we have to be conscious of what inputs we have around us.

(00:35:34):
So let's explore your various options that you have in front of you. One that you mentioned already you tried was to make a list of the things you don't want to be doing anymore, like things you want to say no to. And really committing to that and sticking to that. What are the other kinds of things you could do to help you prioritize and create that sacred 25% of extra time for yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):
Something I've already done, which hasn't kicked in fully yet, but that I'm really excited about is I reduce the cadence of my newsletter and podcast. Which in theory, should be a massive change. But the cadence of the podcast hasn't shifted down yet, it'll happen next year. The newsletter cadences, I basically changed my promise to readers instead of, you'll receive a newsletter every week. Now it's, two to four times a month depending on what's going on.

Rachel Lockett (00:36:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):
Which felt huge. The problem is I still like every week I'm like, "Oh, I want to write about this thing. Oh, every week there's nothing's happening, I got to put this out." So I'm almost not taking advantage of that opportunity. So something I could do is actually not publish every week.

(00:36:45):
Another is just bring on some more help. Which is difficult because I've got a lot of good help and there's only so many things other people can do for me that isn't writing an awesome newsletter and recording conversations like this. But I'm always thinking about, and I should think deeper about where can people take more load off my plate?

Rachel Lockett (00:37:04):
Yeah, I love that insight. What I'm hearing is do less in certain areas and think about your team and really expanding the capacity of your team. And be rigorous about the things you can hand off, that you may have limiting beliefs around the things you need to do versus the people on your team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):
I might, I might. And then your point I loved, which is just improve my policies of what I say no to that don't serve me.

Rachel Lockett (00:37:29):
Yeah. What are the things you could be saying yes to if you said no to more things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:34):
Just playing around with stuff. Just space to explore and tinker, and just sit around and think. Versus just go, go, go, go, go.

Rachel Lockett (00:37:43):
Yeah. I just see you feel so light and excited in that. Like you almost are giddy when you think about that spaciousness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:50):
That'd be so nice.

Rachel Lockett (00:37:52):
And I just want to name reflect back to you how special that is and how much more creative you could be in your work when you have that space and time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:52):
I love that.

Rachel Lockett (00:38:01):
And your bucket's full with care.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
I feel that, I feel that.

Rachel Lockett (00:38:05):
Yeah. So what's one thing you could do in the next two weeks that would help you get closer to the kind of spaciousness you want to create?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):
I love that ... as we go through this, I'm thinking about this growth framework and I love how you're executing it. Like I see it in action, it's so good.

Rachel Lockett (00:38:21):
Yeah, I'm trying to do very simple coaching right now, just [inaudible 00:38:25]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):
Yeah, yeah. No, this is great

Rachel Lockett (00:38:26):
... that it's really easy to follow for your listener.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:28):
Yeah, yeah. This is great. Okay, so what's the one thing I could do in the next couple of weeks to help you move forward on this? I think one is at least skip a week or two of the newsletter and just actually stick to that plan. But it's tough because the next two weeks I got already planned. I got to write a gift guide, that's my ... okay, so the week after, I'll take a break. Okay, cool. So two weeks from the recording this I won't publish a newsletter. And then I'm going to revisit my policies on what I say yes and no to.

Rachel Lockett (00:38:59):
I love that. Think about everything you're saying yes to and what are things you want to say yes to that you could treat it with. So really consider that it's a trade off every time you say yes to something. The more resonant you are with the end state and what's possible for you, the easier it is to be disciplined in the near term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:20):
I love just that element of here's what you'll get out of this. It's not just no, no, no, no. It's like yes to this other thing you really, really want to do.

Rachel Lockett (00:39:25):
Yeah. Exactly. Yes, say it like a resonant full body yes to the things that are in [inaudible 00:39:32].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):
Hell yes.

Rachel Lockett (00:39:32):
Yeah, hell yes. With an exclamation, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):
Awesome.

Rachel Lockett (00:39:36):
Well thank you, Lenny, for letting me just demonstrate what powerful questions are. And the reason I wanted to do that with you is you brought an example that's actually pretty big. It's an emotional thing, it's a cultural norm, it's a way of being that we've all learned to be through growing up and operating in tech, especially. So even with that kind of topic, using a simple grow model can be useful. But people are coming at your listeners with topics that are very complicated, technical, urgent. But the same kinds of questions unlock new opportunity when it's about how to build technical infrastructure or how to influence the executive team or how to ship the go-to-market strategy. So I just want a name that's very transferable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:28):
I love that I got great advice in this conversation already.

Rachel Lockett (00:40:34):
Good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):
What a great ROI for me at least.

Rachel Lockett (00:40:37):
What did it feel like to be coached on your own podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:41):
It was unusual. I'm just like, wait, I got to get back to asking you questions. That's where our minds are right now.

Rachel Lockett (00:40:44):
Okay, all right, all right. We can flip it, we can flip it. I do want to name that typically when you're coached versus told what to do, you're more bought in. So if I told you, Lenny, I've heard all kinds of leaders come to me talking about being too busy. Here's what you should do. Write a list of all the things you're doing, write the things you're going to delegate, cut out 25% of the things on your calendar. I could have given you a laundry list of things that I thought you should do without much context. But you're the expert on your own context and actually what resonates. And you're much more likely to do it if you came up with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:22):
I was going to mention that earlier. That is so incredibly true. No one wants to ... unless you ask for advice, very few people are like, "Please tell me what to do."

Rachel Lockett (00:41:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
I really love just unsolicited advice. That doesn't go well.

Rachel Lockett (00:41:35):
Yeah. And great leaders often say, "Do you want advice or do you want some space to think about it? Can I help you think it through? Or would you like me to tell you what I would do?" And both are fine in certain situations. So asking is useful too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):
Yeah. Okay. That's such an important element of this that we should have mentioned and I'm glad you did.

Rachel Lockett (00:41:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
Okay. So I'm going to go back to asking you questions.

Rachel Lockett (00:41:58):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
This is a good segway to something I wanted to spend a little time on, which is burnout.

Rachel Lockett (00:42:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:05):
What I'm talking about is stuff that often leads to burnout. I'm definitely not burnt out, but this is a common problem in tech. Where people feel depleted and just go too hard. So many people I've worked with just left tech. I had a colleague at Airbnb, he's like a park ranger now near woods. That's how far tech-

Rachel Lockett (00:42:05):
So peaceful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:26):
So peaceful and so wonderful. But I think that's just people go so hard sometimes and then just get burnt out and never want to do anything like this again. I know that you've spent a lot of time on this with founders and you have a really helpful approach. So just talk about what you've learned about helping leaders in tech avoid burnout and feel energized and excited about their work for a long time.

Rachel Lockett (00:42:47):
Yeah. Well first of all, I'm glad you brought it up. It's a huge problem. I remember when I was coaching top talent at Stripe, Patrick Collison is really committed to retaining top talent. And I created a program with my team for the top 50 executives in the tech side of the house. And we looked at their engagement scores, we did coaching circles. And it was so sad to see how exhausted that group of incredibly creative and committed leaders was in that moment.

(00:43:19):
And it's so common that people who start with incredible inspiration and incredible capacity start to feel like they've been pushing and pushing and pushing for years. They're parenting, they're leading, crazy things are happening to the business. And they just can't muster the same kind of motivation they once had. And I see this with my clients all the time.

(00:43:44):
So I've also witnessed people who are still inspired and continually energetic and seem to have some secret well of some diesel battery, or I guess I should say a Tesla battery that helps them through really hard challenges, and they're still having a good time. And so what I make of that is that when people are in their gifts and their strengths firmly, most of the time, they have more energy. We all have more energy when we're operating from the things we naturally are good at and the things we innately love doing.

(00:44:25):
So I try to help my leaders see that they can design their lives so they're spending 80% of their time in their gifts. That seems really ambitious because you're stuck within a context that requires a lot of you. Especially when you're executive at a huge company. But I also interact with founders who started a company with great inspiration, an entrepreneurial vision, and their job has obviously changed every six months. Once you fundraise, once you grow a team. And sometimes, especially technical founders will start solving a technical problem they're absolutely obsessed with. They spend three years doing it, the product ships, and then they're stuck managing a board and a team. And they don't even realize they're doing a completely different job than the one that played to their strengths.

(00:45:17):
So one tool I like to give is for people to actually take two weeks and every night reflect on, what are the five things today that gave me the most energy? And what are the five things that depleted my energy the most? If you do that for two weeks and you look at patterns, you can tell, what are the natural gifts that I'm living in? And what are the things that I'm stuck doing that are exhausting? And they're just slowly ... it's like a slow leak in your gas tank that over time shows up in your daily amount of energy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):
I so believe this advice is so effective. This is the way I actually approach when I left my job. I very actively did this. I paid attention every day, what gave me energy? And what sapped my energy? And let me just do more of the thing that gave me energy and less of the thing that saps me. I want to talk about just like, there's only so much you can change, but I want to talk about that. And so initially I was like, maybe I'll become an advisor and consultant kind of person. I actually found that was super depleting for me.

Rachel Lockett (00:46:22):
Interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):
Doing these calls and talking to people because it's like surface level, here are some things I would do. And it was just so unexciting and energizing. But writing was really energizing, which I'd never expected.

Rachel Lockett (00:46:23):
I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:36):
And that's what I did, and I just followed that pole.

Rachel Lockett (00:46:38):
And it sounds like maybe you need a refresh, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:42):
Oh, interesting.

Rachel Lockett (00:46:43):
There's always more tuning you can do to your gifts. You're in this amazing ... you've clearly been successful for a reason, you're in your strengths and you're paying attention to what brings you energy. We can always do that more throughout our life. I think it's a process of continually tuning in to where your spark is. And protecting that spark, feeding it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:05):
I love that insight, that just blew my mind.

(00:47:08):
So very tactically, the way you would do this is for two weeks every night is the idea, reflect back on that day and write down five things that gave you energy, five things that sap you of energy.

Rachel Lockett (00:47:19):
Yeah, there's so many different activities you could use. So that's one. I like an activity of actually asking five to ten people in your life with a very simple email. When I walk in the room, what shows up? What are my strengths? What are the gifts? If you really don't know them and you haven't spent a lot of time in this realm, that's also an opportunity of actually asking the people who know you best, what your core gifts are? And when do you have the most inspiration?

(00:47:46):
You can also look through your calendar and note themes. Okay, over the last month, what are all the things I look at on my calendar that I'm excited to do? What are the things I dread? Okay, why do I dread those things? What do those things have in common? So there's various ways you can get to what is your zone of genius? But what my invitation is to take that really seriously. It actually takes risk taking, it takes intention to design your life around your gifts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):
Is there any advice for actually doing this? Say someone's just like, "Yeah, I got to do this." But most people don't actually do this. Is there a buddy you can nominate, just help you do this? Is it like if you have an EA, they can maybe help you with this? Is there anything you've seen?

Rachel Lockett (00:48:28):
That's a good question. Yeah, I love your ideas. I think that the people around you need to be on board and know what are your gifts. So for example, when I was an HR business partner, my boss bought into this and I explained to her, "Hey, I started at Stripe because I actually know I'm going to be a coach. I'm not going to be Head of HR. But I love working with leaders. So I'm going to do all the compensation strategy and all the org design, and I'm going to help product and engineering leaders. But what I have in the back of my mind is I'm honing my coaching skills."

(00:48:56):
And so when this opportunity to work on top talent retention came about, it was very aligned in the realm of coaching and L&D, background that I had. So she put me on that. So it's useful to name it to the people around you. What are your gifts? What are your interests? What skills are you really excited to hone? So that they are in a contract with you to help you and really apply your gifts to the business's needs. So that's one thing.

(00:49:23):
When you're a founder, a CEO, when you have the autonomy to consider, what are the role scopes around me? Then you can really hire around it. So I have some CEOs that I work with who are incredible visionaries, great strategists, really good at managing the board, hiring, et cetera. Terrible at managing their team. They hate it. So they hire a COO. And they work in partnership, they have one person who's really internally focused, they get to be externally focused. That works well, it's a symbiotic relationship. If you're honest about your strengths and you're weaknesses, then you can start to manage around them.

(00:51:04):
It's really nice to know what you want to do and understand what your dream life looks like. You also have a job, you have manager, you got things to do, you got responsibilities. So I guess first of all, as you have seen people that are not founders actually make a change to do the things ... to spend more time on their gifts, to actually not just be like ... like there is ... you have agency to move in a direction that'll make you happier.

Rachel Lockett (00:51:28):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):
Is kind of an implied piece of this.

Rachel Lockett (00:51:30):
Yeah, I think sometimes people hire a Chief of Staff to help them and compliment them. Sometimes people design their team with strengths and gifts that they don't have. So it's really ... you can get creative once you really understand, oh, these things give me a ton of energy and these things are exhausting. But I still need to fill this need for the business. What are all the ways I can do it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):
And telling your manager, I think, is such a simple and important part of this. Telling them-

Rachel Lockett (00:51:52):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:58):
... here's where I want to go, here's the things I want to get better at, here's the things that give me energy. Can we just try to make as much of my role that?

Rachel Lockett (00:52:04):
Yeah. Especially if you're executing well, people want to retain you. They want to know, what's going to keep you here for the next five years? And typically they think that means moving up the ladder. But maybe it doesn't for you. I think it does take the courage to move horizontally sometimes to get into your strengths. I mean, I've moved horizontally a number of times and I love what I do, I feel like I'm in my natural gifts. But it took me a few risks and some uncomfortable jobs that didn't feel like they were worthy of my experience in order to get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):
What's a good percentage of your work life that should be in gifts and things that energize you versus, okay, I actually got [inaudible 00:52:48] stuff.

Rachel Lockett (00:52:48):
My litmus test is 80%, that's the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:48):
80%.

Rachel Lockett (00:52:48):
That's the aspiration. You're always going to have 20% of things you don't love doing. There's just the logistics of getting into the zone that you need to be in. But I really try to push people to think aspirationally, that if you're 80% of the time in your gifts, how much energy you have to give to the world. It's so much more inspiring.

(00:53:09):
So I want to tell you why I'm passionate about this topic because it actually is how I ended up as an Executive Coach. So 10 years ago, I was working at a small company called Remind, and I was running the UX Research team. And the CEO asked me to move into the Product Manager role for the Core Product team. And I was excited for the opportunity. I had non-technical background, but I thought, "Hey, all these strategists are up there creating the roadmap. I can do that. I know exactly what our users need." So I was excited for this.

(00:53:44):
I came into the team, there was I think 12 senior engineers, very opinionated, very skeptical, this non-technical PM, but we worked together. And what I did was I listened. I learned what do our users need? What does this team need? What's working and not working? And with-

Rachel Lockett (00:54:00):
What does this team need? What's working and not working? And within a month, this team was working well together. They were reviewing each other's code base. They were really disagreeing in a healthy way in our team meetings. They felt more connected to users. And I felt like, "Okay, this rhythm is working." But what I was also doing as I was at home stressing in the middle of the night about the new user experience, I couldn't decide which of the designs to go with. I was always over leveraging our data scientists, and I found myself swirling on decisions that didn't need to have so much stress involved. And one day I went for a walk with my colleague Zach Abrams, and he was a great product manager and he was listening to me ask all these questions about how to sell the vision of what this product would look like in the future.

(00:54:55):
And he said, "Rachel, you're a zone of genius or your gift is not being a product strategist, but I've watched you over the last few months, and you have gotten the team more motivated than I ever could, and you've influenced the entire executive team behind your ideas, and that's impressive. You're a people person." And at first I was offended. What? You think I don't have the ability to be a great product leader? And yet I sat with what he said, and I knew he was right. Both my parents are therapists. I never wanted to be a therapist. Here I am. I'm basically a work therapist. I love entrepreneurial energy, I love big vision, but I'm a people person. 

(00:55:40):
And I left that, and I realized I love what my coach does. I got trained as a coach. I went into HR leadership. And Zach, who was a gifted product strategist, went on to lead product at Coinbase and BREX and most recently Bridge, which was acquired by Stripe, and he's still my client. And we've watched our journeys over the last decade, and we've both been honing our gifts. Life is more fun when you're in your gifts, and you have more inspiration and capacity to offer the world. So I just want to share that story because it's helpful to be honest with the people you care about when they seem energized and when they seem depleted because sometimes it's a wakeup call for people to really think about what is their spark and to protect it and to feed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:36):
I love that story because I think most people when they hear this advice and this topic of, "Okay, I am feeling depleted, I'm feeling burnt out," I feel like most people jump to, "Okay, but I can't actually do anything about it. I have a job. I got responsibilities." What I'm getting from this is the most important step is jump to figure out what you actually should be doing. What gives you energy? What your gifts are. It feels like that's the biggest gap for people because once you know that, there are ways to do that. Talk to your manager. "It may not be possible today, but here's where I want to be going. Here's what I want to be spending time on." I love your point you made though about you actually have to be doing well for your manager to listen to you. You can't just be sucking and then like, "Oh, but I want to work on strategy."

Rachel Lockett (00:57:19):
Yeah. Well, it's no one else's job to help you live in your gifts. And what I notice in big companies is people are often annoyed or frustrated with their management for not making their job more interesting. It's like, "No, your manager's job is to help you perform in the job you were hired to do. It's your job to navigate your career." So over the arc of your career, how do you match your gifts with the world's needs? And if the world right now is your company, how do you understand the needs enough so that you can apply your strengths to those needs?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:54):
This reminds me, there's a couple of guests I've had on the podcast who did this. They're both founders, so this is specific to founders, but Rahul Vohra at Superhuman, he realized he's not the best executor operations person, so he hired a president that took all that office plate. And then Darmesh, co-founder of HubSpot, he knew from the beginning he didn't want to manage people, so he made a rule with his co-founder, "I will never have reports." And he's the CTO, I believe, and has zero reports, has no one-on-ones.

Rachel Lockett (00:58:23):
Yeah. And I think that it's a beautiful thing to recognize that, but then to actually address the needs of those reports also. I think often people know, "Ugh, I don't want to have one-on-ones," but just not having anyone to manage those people is not going to be healthy for your company. So you have to both take your strength seriously and actively manage around your weaknesses.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
Is there any maybe last piece of advice on this topic of helping people get to a place where they're feeling much less depleted and just more energized at work?

Rachel Lockett (00:58:53):
I would start small. You don't have to leave your job and redesign your life. You can stop going to the optional things that are exhausting. You can leave space between the things that are depleting that you have to go to outside and go on a 30-minute walk and refuel your tank. Start with tomorrow. What are the three things you're going to do to plug up that gas leak and re-energize your spark? It might even be you love to read and you're going to start reading 30 minutes before you go to sleep every night. It doesn't have to be a dramatic life change, but recognize that only you know what is resonant and what is depleting, and it's your job to take that seriously if you want to show up purposeful and impactful in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
I love that advice. I've actually started reading before bed for 30 minutes, and that's been so joyful, like a physical book with a little nightlight.

Rachel Lockett (00:59:48):
I agree. I love a physical book. I have a Kindle, I got all the things, but a physical book on the couch is the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):
Yeah, it's just that nightlight is key because sometimes at nighttime you need a night book. So we've been talking mostly so far about individual improvement, how to figure out what you should be working on, just helping learning to coach, things like that. I want to take us up a little level above and talk about team skills, how people get better at working with other people. Something that you are in many ways known for is helping co-founders build better relationships. And in my experience one of the most challenging parts of starting a company is the co-founder relationship. A lot of people don't realize what they're getting into. You're basically getting married to this person in a very high stress situation, and you sometimes don't know much about them.

Rachel Lockett (01:00:38):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:39):
And then you not working well together is just a huge issue because that all trickles down, and everyone sees it. And when co-founders leave, it's really bad for everyone. So let me just ask you this, what have you found most helpful in helping co-founders build great relationships, stay happy and productive?

Rachel Lockett (01:00:56):
Yeah, thanks for asking this. I love working with co-founders because I think your core values as a person come out when they interact with someone else's core values. Conflict, healthy conflict or otherwise, is actually where your core values come out. So it's fascinating to watch people try to do something incredibly hard in the context of someone else's vision, someone else's strengths and weaknesses and navigate that together. So there's so much energy in the co-founder dynamic for me and for co-founders themselves. It's actually something that people don't feel comfortable going to their board about or talking to that many people about because it's a private matter. It's almost like in a marriage you go see a couples' therapist, but you don't tell all your friends that you can't stand your partner, but it keeps you up at night. So it's a really tender, important relationship, and there aren't enough supports for co-founders to navigate it. It's very normal. 

(01:01:50):
In fact, I know you probably know this stat, 65% of startups fail because of co-founder conflict, and co-founders are in a moment where they're trying to build the future for their business, but also trying to build their own livelihood. So there's so much at stake to get along with your co-founder. I think the core at its core, what you need in a healthy relationship is, one, self-awareness. What do I bring into this dynamic, and how am I being experienced by the other person? What does this other person bring into the dynamic, and how am I reacting to that? So the first is just collective awareness about what is our dynamic. I like to use the Enneagram for this, but there's all kinds of tools, self-awareness tools that you can use to give a common language to what is my thing and what is your thing.

(01:02:46):
A very classic one has to do with roles. CTOs tend to be skeptics. They love facts, they seek knowledge. They want depth of awareness and understanding, and they also like to be self-sufficient. This is a total generalization, but I've seen this pattern over and over again. The CEO is the person who had to sell the vision. They're a person who loves big picture vision strategy. They often are great at influencing others. They love to sell ahead of the reality of what the company's actually built. This creates an inherent tension between blind optimism and skepticism, and it's a dance that these two roles play together. So the first part is knowing the dance you're in, so you're not just stepping on each other's toes blindly. 

(01:03:34):
The second step is actually being conscious about the commitment you're making to your relationship. In a marriage, for example, I talk about co-founder vows and recommitments and renewals because in a marriage you get married, and a lot of times people build a family and then they think, "Oh, the relationship will just continue around each other all the time. We're doing this thing together." But just like couples need a date night, co-founders need time and space to connect with each other to come together and say, "How's this working for you? Are we still aligned on our vision and our strategy? How are we working together? What am I doing that's pissing you off? What are the things that have gone unsaid and that we need to talk about?" 

(01:04:20):
But if you're just in the hustle and bustle of running and scaling your startup, you don't make time for that conversation. So I think it's incredibly important for co- founders to make space for their relationship, whether that's a dinner every other week, whether that's going out to lunch regularly, whether that's just touching base business-wise, but having an in-person quarterly check-in. That space is critical for the health of a co-founder relationship.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
On that second piece, the vows idea is such a good idea. Is that something you actually recommend, here's what I vow to do?

Rachel Lockett (01:04:56):
Yeah, here's what I commit to do. So recently I actually wrote an article with First Round, and we created a document to help co-founders think about what to integrate into their check-in. So we put out weekly check-in, monthly check-in and annual and just questions to sit down and ask each other. Active listening skills will come in handy in those conversations, but it's about taking space out of hustling and running the business to think about the business from a like to say, instead of being on the dance floor, you need time on the balcony to look down at what's happening. How are we doing? Is this still working for both of us? And the vows are really about, how are we going to be together? How are we going to show up? What's our culture that we're creating? 

(01:05:43):
Even if you don't want to go through a whole culture exercise early on in building your company, you should have some sense of how you want to show up for each other. How are we going to make decisions? How are we going to deal with conflict? These are things you can go into intentionally and design with your co-founder.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):
Awesome. We're going to link to that post The first step, Enneagram sounds like that's what you recommend, and this is basically a personality profile that a lot of people love.

Rachel Lockett (01:06:12):
I really like the Enneagram. I think you can also simply tell each other, "Here are my strengths. Here's what I see as my weaknesses, and what do you think? Give me some feedback. Do you agree?" And you can do that with each other without any personality assessment. If you want to just be scrappy and have an open connected conversation about, you could even say, what are the gifts I bring and the weaknesses I have, and how will I cover those? How will I lean into my gifts? How will I cover my weaknesses, and how will you? And then I think it's worthwhile having a conversation about, what are the gaps neither of us cover that we're likely going to need as we build this business?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):
What do you recommend people do when they are just like, "Our relationship isn't working great. There's a lot of tension"? All this advice we've been talking about, at the beginning, here's things you can do to set things up for success. Understand what you're good at, what you're bringing to the table. Consciously commit to, here's what I'm going to do, here's what you're going to do. Have these dinners or lunches. I love this metaphor of going out on the balcony and just reflecting on how it's going. So that's all really great. What if you're just already in it and it's really annoying, I don't like this person that much or so much tension constantly. What are a couple things they can do this week, next week?

Rachel Lockett (01:07:27):
Co-founders typically come to me either in this early phase where they want to intentionally build something great and they want to set it up for success. More often co-founders come when they're really frustrated with one another. They feel the tension is palpable. They can't stand it anymore, but they're still really deeply committed to the business so they don't see an out. And they knew that at some point they really loved this cofounder, so they see a possibility of recovering, and that's why they want to go get a coach. I'm going to give you an example of this PR duo running a fierce business scaling really fast. And at one point when they started, you had the visionary who was great at selling business. They were both incredible with PR, and the partner was incredible operationally. 

(01:08:17):
So as the business scaled, one took on a lot more business development and the other took on all the internal things, but was exhausted by all this people management and all of the elements of running a scaled team that she didn't expect to have to do. And when they came, I think both of them weren't sure, can we figure this out? Do we want to just sell this thing? Do we want to keep going? And I think someone said, "End it or send," was what one co-founder said to me. They're coming at this decision point. And what I saw them do is, one, they named current state really well. They were both able to share. We did use a 360. So they got feedback from their teams and then shared it with one another, but they were able to be open and vulnerable in what was working and what wasn't working. Not immediately, but over time. 

(01:09:16):
And they realized they used to love being partners in this work, but as they began to lead different teams, they grew very distant from one another. They were living on opposite sides of the country and actually just coming together and realizing what each other was missing and how lonely it is to lead this scaling company without each other's support and how they actually needed the counterbalance to their strengths and didn't have it was a important start to their healing.

(01:09:48):
And over our coaching, they turned back towards each other and they created more of a rhythm of how they would get together without me involved. And they ended coaching after our arc feeling renewed and really recommitted. They made some changes on their leadership team to fill their gaps. They also started, I think, meeting once a week virtually, and they started a cadence of getting together in person quarterly. And I don't mean to say that just that time means you're going to heal, sometimes coming together and really grappling. I had one last week where we all came together, we had a great full day in-person discussion about how they were making this co-founder duo, how they were making decisions. 

(01:10:36):
And after that conversation, it was really clear that one of the co-founders was unhappy and didn't appreciate the other one and was not going to change and realized he was a big part of the problem and I think is going to leave the business. But that's still success because it's clarity. You're not muddling in the dark, frustrated, unconscious about the interpersonal dynamics you're in, you're making a choice based on your strengths and what the business needs and this relationship dynamic that you're in to either be in it or to lovingly step out of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:16):
I love how similar this is to just the marriage, all this stuff. This is the same sort of thing you would do.

Rachel Lockett (01:11:21):
Totally. I mean a marriage, you're building a life with a partner. So the only difference is a marriage is rooted in sexual attraction and love, and that's not the case always in the co-founder dynamic. But I have worked with couples who are also co-founders, but there should be some element of love for your co-founder. In fact, I think that when you work closely with colleagues and you really are able to see their gifts and enable them, you can't help but love them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:52):
That's a big statement. The other takeaway here is that just get coaching. It feels like that's the solution if things are just not working great. There's only so far you can get just talking.

Rachel Lockett (01:12:01):
It takes an evolved facilitator, one of the co-founders, being able to hold space for both their frustration and their empathy in a dynamic that is challenging. So outside support is useful. Sometimes it's actually a team member, it's an HR leader. It's the GC who happens to have great people skills. You don't always need a coach, but you need space to be vulnerable, open, and curious. So if you can create that on your own, that's great. I think it's definitely possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:35):
Outside of the co-founder relationship, do you have any just tactical tips for people to improve their interpersonal skills with just team members, anyone they work with, just people that may struggle like, "Man, I have a hard time with this person. I just have a hard time with a lot of people"?

Rachel Lockett (01:12:50):
First of all, people when they want to have a conflict or they want to engage in something that's not working, they come in armored and ready to prove their point. It's natural. You've been thinking about this, perseverating over whether you should mention it. You finally get to the point of engaging, and often there's a misguided view that the goal is to convince the other person that what they're doing is wrong. Actually, the goal of any conflict is to create mutual understanding. So when I go in to have a conversation with, let's say my husband who's not doing his share of the parenting, my goal is to help him understand what I'm struggling with so that he can empathize, see clearly what's happening, and perhaps meet my needs in some way. But it's not for me to prove to him how little he's doing in the house because he might have a totally different story about what's happening. 

(01:13:54):
So I'm going to give you a framework that I like that many of my clients use. It's from Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication. It is a book and a framework. So it's four steps. The first step is observations. So my job is to note what is happening factually. For example, I noticed that in the last three sprint planning meetings, you didn't invite me to those conversations or share with me the roadmap. That's an observation. It's a fact. I could take a picture of it, and no one would argue with it. The next step is feelings. So I'm going to express my feelings without blame. So I felt anxious not knowing what was on the roadmap for the week. I felt confused about whether that meeting happened or not because I wasn't included. So this is me sharing my feelings so the other party can empathize and understand what I'm going through without being defensive.

(01:14:59):
The third step is needs. What are my universal human needs related to this topic? We all have needs. This is not requiring anything of the other person, just helping them understand my needs that are not met. So I have a need for clarity, I have a need for collaboration, I have a need for connection, whatever that is. And lastly, the step is to make a request. Now, in this model, the request is an olive branch to help the other person meet you and see you. It shouldn't be something that's impossible to do. It should be actually something quite small and easy to achieve for the other person to feel successful in connecting to you and understanding you. So in this case, I might make a request. I'd like to ask you next time you have a sprint planning meeting to include me as optional or to send me the roadmap afterwards that you align on. 

(01:15:54):
Now, the other person doesn't have to meet my request. They might make a counter proposal, but the most important thing of this model in this conversation is that the other person understands what I'm going through and they don't feel reactive so that we can have a mutual conversation about what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:12):
Wow. This point about how when you're trying to convince someone of something, when something is going wrong, this point that your goal is not to convince them, that your goal is to have mutual understanding, that just blew my mind, and I think it's going to change my life. Wow.

Rachel Lockett (01:16:32):
Lenny, try this with your wife tonight. NVC is a powerful tool, and actually it's very akin to most models that are about connection. The Stanford Business School course that has a T, it's called Touchy Feely that everybody loves.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:48):
Yeah, we've had Carol on the podcast.

Rachel Lockett (01:16:49):
Great. Yeah, so Carol Robbins created this movement. There's lit. A lot of founders go to her model that's for founders.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
And tech.

Rachel Lockett (01:16:56):
And this is all about, they talk about a net that you can talk about your feelings and your reaction, but as soon as you cross the net to blaming someone else or making an assumption, they're going to have a defensive response. But you can be incredibly bold and brave if you stay on your side of the net. So this model helps you do that because it's really about sharing your emotions and your needs and making a request without blame.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):
Yeah. So what I was going to say as you were going through this framework is here's me, here's what I saw, here's what I'm feeling, here's what I need. And then now that you have that in context, here's something I'm asking for versus you did this and you're feeling this and you thought this.

Rachel Lockett (01:17:37):
Exactly. It also acknowledges that professionals have feelings. I think that we operate in tech. We're supposed to give all of ourselves, all of our time, all of our energy to this endeavor. And it's purely logical. It's not at all true. It's completely emotional. And if we ignore our feelings, they will bubble up, and we will be unconsciously acting from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):
And there's this implicit power here that if the person cares about you and loves you or values your relationship, knowing that this makes them feel bad will make them want to change. It's not like you need to tell them, "Change this thing. Oh, I didn't realize this made you upset or that you have this need. And now that I know that, okay, now I see why this is important to you."

Rachel Lockett (01:18:22):
That's exactly right. And sometimes the other person will hear that and have a different story or a different perspective. So they might say, " Okay, I can honor that request," or, "I hear that request, and I hear your feelings, but let me explain what happened for me." And one way you could do that is, are you open to hearing that? So they're able to share their side too. You don't have to just agree with the person's request. As long as you're setting this tone, the other person's more likely to contribute in a way that achieves mutual understanding because once you're vulnerable, they're going to share their vulnerability.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
Let me remind folks of the framework. I'm going to try using this. I wish it was a handy acronym off. So the framework is share what you've observed, just the facts of what is happening. Just simply, I saw you didn't close the fridge fully. Your feelings of how that made you feel, the needs that your core human need that drives that feeling, I imagine. And then the request you have of the person.

Rachel Lockett (01:19:28):
Yes. And I want to make one note I forgot to say, which is feelings are emotions. So sometimes people say things like, "I feel like you're being a jerk." That's not a feeling, obviously. A feeling is a sensation in your body that results in an emotion. So naming a feeling is actually not easy for technical leaders sometimes. I want to make that point because emotions are what get you to the underlying humanity of connection. Emotions are the key to soliciting empathy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:05):
Are there phrases that are just examples of non-feelings, like using the word "you" in the way you describe a feeling probably is not a good sign?

Rachel Lockett (01:20:14):
Exactly. If you can say, "I feel like... " even if you add like or, "I feel that... " you're probably going to add a fact. It should be an emotion word after I feel.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):
So don't say like, don't say you, don't say that?

Rachel Lockett (01:20:27):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:29):
Awesome. Along this topic, I chatted with a number of clients that have worked with you over the years, and one of the most common themes that they said you help them with is having difficult conversations. And I think we covered actually much of this in what we just talked about, but I'm curious if there's any other advice you have for helping people have difficult conversations. Let me read a quote from one of your clients.

Rachel Lockett (01:20:52):
Oh, wow. I love this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:54):
So she said, "Rachel is exceptional at making difficult decisions clear and making it feel possible to get these decisions actualized." Is there anything more-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:00):
... these decisions actualized. Is there anything more there for, because difficult conversations are difficult. How do we help people make them less difficult? Any tips?

Rachel Lockett (01:21:11):
Yeah. Well, first of all, difficult conversations makes you want to run away. The marketing on conflict is poor, so I want to reframe that. My belief is when we feel internally ambivalent, we have two inner parts at war. And there's something really beautiful and important to pay attention to, there's something to learn, when we have ambivalence. When we are in conflict, something important is at stake. We care deeply about what we're building, about the person that's letting us down. So the reason it's hard, is because there's such an emotional component to it. And there's something to learn from it.

(01:21:57):
So first, I want leaders who are listening to think, "This is hard, because I have something to learn here, and because it matters. So instead of avoiding it and running away, I'm going to lean into this moment. And I'm going to come out of it not just having solved this dynamic, and not just having said my piece, but having built a skill." The reason I focus on interpersonal dynamics is because the quality of our relationships determines the quality of our life. I really believe that. And if you cannot have conflict, you can't have healthy relationships. We are going to disagree with the people we love, or care about, or are building a business with. So first, I just want listeners to reframe ambivalence and interpersonal challenge, think of them as a growth opportunity.

(01:22:56):
Second, there is always something that we're doing to contribute to the conflict, even if it feels like the other person is insane, and is driving us crazy, and we're the innocent party. So entering any conflict conversation with humility, and curiosity about the other person's experience, is critical to setting the table for a commitment to come out better and stronger. So no model, NVC or otherwise, can fix a person who's coming in rigid and full of blame. I really love the 15 Commitments to Conscious Leaders, I don't know if you know that book, but one of the concepts is about taking a hundred percent responsibility. Not being in the world of blame, being a victim, or being a hero. And I see many leaders, when they're in a challenging interpersonal conflict, being in victimhood, being in blame, or being in hero. "I'm just going to do it for them, and forget it. They're having such a hard time getting this done, I'm just going to do it."

(01:24:10):
Instead, take responsibility for your part. "What is my piece in making this dynamic happen and how can I address it?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:18):
That makes me think about, Jerry Colonna was on the podcast, and he has this famous line that I've always remembered. How are you complicit in creating the conditions that you claim you don't want?

Rachel Lockett (01:24:29):
Yes, I love that. Love that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:32):
And there's so many, there's three parts to that whole question, I won't get into it. But what you're sharing here is, think about that, figure out how, because your point is, you're always somehow complicit in creating the issue you're complaining about. And use that to help kind of put down the defense of the person like, "Here's what I've contributed to this problem." Do you use the nonviolent communication framework? And I don't know, is that just a general way of trying to have difficult conversations, or is there not a framework?

Rachel Lockett (01:24:58):
Yeah, no, I think that's a great framework for when you want to go interact with someone around something that's not working for you. I think typically a difficult conversation arises because some feelings are coming up for you, and you have a need that's not being met. And so, that's the instigator to know, "Okay, I need to talk to this person. We need to clear this up."

(01:25:17):
For example, I was working with a CEO whose co-founder was constantly undercutting his decisions, and criticizing him. And there was something happening, where they'd gone from being this great dynamic duo, fundraised, hired a few leaders, and then all of a sudden he was getting daggers thrown at him all the time. And it was exhausting, and frustrating, and confusing. That was a time where he used NVC to address, "What is happening, here?" And it turned out that the co-founder was really frustrated with how he was spending his time. He didn't want him to be off selling, he wanted him to be helping him with product vision. And they had a totally different conception of how the CEO should be spending his time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:02):
Awesome. Just remind folks of the NVC framework, because this is the thing that's hard in the moment. Like, "Oh, what should I be saying?" Observe, feelings, needs, request.

Rachel Lockett (01:26:11):
Yeah, exactly. And there's a nonviolent communication book, if folks are into the framework, and want to check it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:17):
People need a little... Who was it, you said one of your client's tattooed the vision he had, on-

Rachel Lockett (01:26:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):
Okay, there's, let's just get something.

Rachel Lockett (01:26:24):
Maybe don't tattoo NVC.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:25):
Because that may be [inaudible 01:26:25]

Rachel Lockett (01:26:27):
It doesn't have a good acronym. You could just print it out, and put it right next to your screen, or something-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:27):
All right, okay.

Rachel Lockett (01:26:30):
... if you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:31):
No tattoos. I just want to highlight the first point you made in this answer, of having difficult conversations. And then I have one more question for you. Just this point about, if there's something you're afraid of, that is a sign you should do that. There's a quote I often think of. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek." And the advice there is just, the thing you're afraid of is a compass too, the thing you should do. Because there's something important there.

Rachel Lockett (01:26:58):
I love that. Yeah. It's like, "What's important here? What do I have to learn here?" Is a question you can ask yourself when you're avoiding something. I often see this in talent management situations. A CEO has an underperforming COO. They're avoiding a conversation, because they keep getting let down, and actually they kind of know deep down, this is not working out. They don't want to face it. It's too much work. They need to just keep plowing forward.

(01:27:27):
And when we really take space to think about their feelings and needs, they realize, I ask them, "Would you enthusiastically rehire this person for the same role?" Which is the question we always asked at Stripe. And when the answer is no to that, no matter how many difficult conversations you have, this is not going to work. So then you have to take action. And even engaging in the hard conversation, and seeing what happens, can lead you to the clarity that you need to take action on talent that's not working.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:01):
That is a really cool tip. I did not know Stripe operated that way. We had the CTO of Netflix on the podcast, Elizabeth Stone, and this is very much how they operate. They're always asking a question like that. The way you phrased it was, "Would I enthusiastically rehire this person for the same role?"

Rachel Lockett (01:28:18):
Exactly. It's very clarifying, because it's binary. People have a physical sense, just like we talked about a full body yes, before? You have a immediate reaction that is honest, to that question, that provides clarity.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:33):
And the answer isn't, if it's no, it's not, "Fire them." It's, "You need to do something about it." It could be talk to them about it, put them on a performance plan, put them in a different role. It doesn't mean you have to fire them immediately, so it's not necessarily as scary as it sounds, if you say no.

Rachel Lockett (01:28:47):
Yeah, I think that also it depends on the stage of business you're in. So I see a lot of companies build a leadership team, and then a year later, the size and stage of their business is dramatically different. And they start to realize, "Oh, the CFO that was really fine back then, is now completely wrong. He should be the controller." Okay, great. So reckon with that. Recognize that in how you're interacting with your current CFO, put out a search. There's many things you can do that aren't firing someone. But in quickly scaling businesses, it's natural that the leadership team's job will change, and that you'll have to make some evolution over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:28):
And I guess it's very important to highlight the importance of operating this way, if you're trying to build a really successful company, is that should be the bar. Is, if you would not enthusiastically rehire this person for this role. If you're trying to build something that's never been built before, and build a company that actually works out really well, you need to really only have people around that are hitting that bar.

Rachel Lockett (01:29:50):
Yeah. My perspective, I talked at the beginning about how I'm obsessed with the human side of business building, and my belief is that talent and the environment that you put your talent in is everything. Yes. Building a product and a business is about building something that users need. It's about product market fit, and then the wave you're on. Timing is important. You're going to build a different size business, if you're in a sector that's not growing, than right now, if you're in the middle of AI. True. You're riding a timing wave, and you're solving a core need. But everything besides that is so human. It's about talent, and it's about the environment that you put that talent in. So you need to create the conditions such that your talent can thrive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:37):
Such a simple concept, that I think people overlook, is just everything you do is going to be the people that you have around you, and the environment you create for them to operate. I think your point about when you're doing something difficult, just to close out this element, I love this idea that if it feels hard, think of it as a learning opportunity. I think anyone listening to this is like, "Oh, cool, I'm going to learn something. I'm going to get better." It's such a easier, more motivating way of approaching something that's difficult.

Rachel Lockett (01:31:05):
And I want to make a distinction between that and what we talked about earlier, which was, lean into your strengths. Because I don't believe people should suffer through the day grinding, doing work that's depleting. That's not a learning opportunity. Interpersonally, when you're avoiding something, it's because you care about something. Avoiding your emotions is what I want to encourage people against. We have to feel our feelings all the way through, be present to our feelings, and interact with others in a way that acknowledges our feelings. That's what I want to encourage, because actually that's not deadening, that's enlivening. And there's learning there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):
A final area I want to spend a little time on is, something that I've heard from everybody that you work with, which is the way that you help them operate. So you just talked about the importance of the people you hire and the environment you create for them. And something that you help leaders do is create a very specific way of operating around a one-page plan, and how that kind of trickles down and just makes everything at a company more effective. Talk about this one-page plan, how you recommend companies operate with this.

Rachel Lockett (01:32:17):
Yeah, thanks for asking that question. I think, typically, companies have complicated the process of aligning their vision, their strategy, their goals, and the way people behave with each other, their values. So that all of these things live in different places, are talked about to a different degree, resonate to employees differently. And if you asked anyone at the company, "What are your top three priorities, and how do they relate to the vision?" It's not an easy answer.

(01:32:50):
So the reason I like the one-page plan concept is, it's simplifying. It's a way for the leadership team to come together and align around, " What are we doing here? What is our role in it? And how do we communicate it, so that the whole company has clarity, and knows how the work they're doing ladders up to our big picture vision that we're all committed to?"

(01:33:14):
So I actually got this idea of the one-page plan from Alpine Investors. They have something called the People First Operating Rhythm, and they've successfully implemented that at their portfolio companies. And I work in concert with Alpine, so I work with some of their portfolio CEOs. To execute this rhythm. So it's not just about a one-page plan. It puts your vision and your values on the first column, your strategic intentions and your KPIs on the second column, your annual goals on the third, and your quarterly goals on the fourth. So that no matter what you're talking about, in terms of, "What are we doing for the next year, or the next quarter? How do we prioritize?" It's always in tandem with your core KPIs, your strategy, and your vision.

(01:34:04):
And I love how they instituted that with their portfolio, and I saw the power of it. They've collected some data that their portfolio companies that actually institute the People First Operating Rhythm result in higher returns. So they're very committed to this strategy, and after operating with CEOs in their rhythm, I took some of those ideas and started to help other founders and other leaders with some of the same concepts, in my own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:30):
We're going to hopefully link to a template of this one-page plan?

Rachel Lockett (01:34:33):
Yeah, sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:33):
Okay, cool.

Rachel Lockett (01:34:33):
Happy to share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:34):
Okay, so let's do that. And then, what kind of impact do you see from companies starting to operate this way to motivate people to do this?

Rachel Lockett (01:34:41):
Yeah. What I see is clarity and alignment. And I also see more connection. So I want to name that it's not just about having a plan, it's about how you create it, how you reflect on it, and how you come together around it to celebrate wins.

(01:34:57):
So in my opinion, a very under- attended to part of building a business is an operating rhythm. When do you come together to kick off the year, and share your strategy and vision again, and talk about the goals? When do you come together to reflect on what's working and not working, and how do you do that? And in what groups? And are you honest, or are you just kind of doing it as a quick exercise to move on to what's pressing?

(01:35:25):
So just like I said in co-founder dynamics, a key is to step out of the dance floor and to get onto the balcony. Executive teams leading a complex business need time away from being in the business to work on the business. So around this one-page plan, the reason I like a rhythm, is you can kick off the year with the plan. That's really simple, easy to understand. Everyone can have it accessible and every quarter, you can get together to reflect, "What worked, what didn't work?"

(01:35:56):
I really like the question, "What's an inconvenient truth?" Air the things that need to be talked about, that no one's talking about because you're too busy. That's the power of combining a simple plan, whether it's one page or not, that aligns you from the top to the bottom, your vision all the way down to your quarterly goals. And a time where you stop, pause, discuss, reflect, have a little spacious energy.

(01:36:26):
It's not unlike what you said about your own time. You are the executive team. You want a little bit of spacious time to tinker, reflect, create, and come back to the meaningful work you're doing more energized. And leadership teams need that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:45):
Wait, Alpine Investors, Graham Weaver. He was on the podcast.

Rachel Lockett (01:36:45):
I saw that. I saw that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:49):
I love that. Okay, final, final question. I want to take us to AI corner before we get to the very exciting lighting round. I'm going to do kind of a tweaked version. Usually I ask people just, how has AI impacted their work and life? I guess that is the question here, just how has AI changed, I guess coaching, as a coach? But also just, from a client's perspective, how are people using AI to help them in their, I guess life, from a coaching perspective?

Rachel Lockett (01:37:13):
Yeah, it's a great question. So as a coach, I use AI in a couple of key ways, that I'm grateful for. One, I use Granola, which I saw you give away to your listeners.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
One free year of Granola, for becoming an annual subscriber of Lenny's Newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com.

Rachel Lockett (01:37:29):
There you go.

(01:37:29):
So I use Granola to take notes in our session so I can be fully present with my clients, and I can give them a synthesis of what happened and the next steps they committed to after our session. I also use it, I put them in a folder for every client, and so I can look at insights across our work together. What are the deeper things that are happening? What are the patterns that are taking place? I have these in my head, but actually it's a great tool, to see over time. "Oh yeah, we talked about that in our first session. Let's bring that back, because that's what you're struggling with now." So it helps me create the kind of transformation that I want for all my clients.

(01:38:08):
Secondly, I just use ChatGPT to help me plan my retreats. I run a women's organization, and we have eight retreats a year, and it's a great tool to think expansively about new activities. Once I've gotten the core objectives down, and I have a bunch of ideas about what I want to do, it gives me new creative ideas. So I can put in like, "Here's my objective, here's my goal, here's my audience, here's my last retreat that I ran. I kind of want three new ideas for this session." So it'll give me creative energy that I otherwise would need to get together with other coaches to discuss. And I do that, too.

(01:38:50):
Finally, I'm experimenting with AI in a way to support my clients between sessions. So I've gotten some feedback from my clients that they would like more interaction between our sessions, and they're always allowed to email me, or text me. I'm available to them. But I think they want to be really respectful of my time, and so some people do reach out and ask me questions, and other people wait for our session.

(01:39:17):
So I'm curious about the future of coaching, how in between sessions, clients can get access to more of an AI support, where the bot has all of their context, their development plan that we create at the beginning. So that's their goals, for our work together, how they want to grow. Some of my core frameworks, and my beliefs, and my training. And the Granola notes from all of our sessions, so that they can access between, just some extra spot support. They're going into this conversation, how should they approach it? They're anxious about this team meeting. How can they make the most of it? More tactical support. I see personal coaching as still critical for, "What is your vision of your life? How do you want to shift your core behavior to align with that vision?" But then, AI can play a real helpful role in between, on the tactics.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:15):
That is super cool. So that's something you already do, where they have access to this kind of GPT-

Rachel Lockett (01:40:19):
It's something I'm building right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:20):
You're building, that is-

Rachel Lockett (01:40:21):
My clients don't have that yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:22):
Okay. That is great. That is a really good idea. It's not replacing coaching and therapists, let's say, but it's adding a lot more in-between time where you could just talk to us, based on everything you've talked about, all the frameworks that you use. That is extremely cool. All right. There's a billion-dollar company coming.

Rachel Lockett (01:40:39):
I don't want to build that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:43):
It's not your zone of genius.

Rachel Lockett (01:40:44):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:47):
Rachel, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Rachel Lockett (01:40:55):
What I want to share is that the world is getting more lonely. There's a lot of research on this, but it's also obvious in my coaching sessions, that people feel more alienated from one another. And actually, building businesses is an inherently human endeavor. So I am a fan of this AI boom, I appreciate that we have more technology at our fingertips than ever before. But I want to encourage listeners to think of themselves as leaders who bring humans together to self-actualize, and that they have to actively overcome the default state, which is blind, grind, and loneliness. So I think this is a call to action for your listeners, to connect with the people around them, lead healthier teams, create environments where connection is inevitable. And that they will have more fun, and build better businesses, because of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:03):
What a beautiful way to end it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Rachel Lockett (01:42:10):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:11):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Rachel Lockett (01:42:16):
One of them I said before, The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leaders. And I love Designing Your Life, by Bill Burnett.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:25):
I love that book, too. People don't talk about that book enough. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Rachel Lockett (01:42:31):
Oh, God. I just went to KPop Demon Hunters with my daughter. It's so embarrassing, but that's what we dressed as for Halloween, like everyone else in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:38):
I have not seen that. I hear everyone talking about it. I am going to try to avoid it, I think. Next question. Favorite product you have recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be a gadget, could be clothes.

Rachel Lockett (01:42:48):
I really love Loom.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:50):
Amazing.

Rachel Lockett (01:42:51):
I've been recording trainings on Loom for some of my clients that are, it's a scaled holding company, so I'm able to scale training in a really human, connected way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:02):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, in work or in life?

Rachel Lockett (01:43:06):
I have a quote that is on my desk. And I love it. Ready? "If you can see your path laid out in front of you, step by step, it's not your path. Your own path, you make with every step you take. That's why it's your path." That's a Joseph Campbell quote.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:27):
Beautiful. Final question. You've got two kids, you said. Do you have any favorite children's books that you most love reading to them, that they've loved most?

Rachel Lockett (01:43:36):
Oh my gosh. So my daughter is really into Roald Dahl. I love Roald Dahl, because he's completely irreverent, and he has a crazy imagination. So we've been reading Witches, Matilda, all of his books. And both my kids love it. So, they're five and seven.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:54):
Have you seen the Wes Anderson stories of his stories, where he takes [inaudible 01:43:58]-

Rachel Lockett (01:43:58):
Some of them, yeah. They're great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:00):
Yeah, they're so amazing. Oh my God. And it's like Roald Dahl is like, I think it's personifying him. He's like a character in the story.

Rachel Lockett (01:44:06):
Yeah, he's a character, from what I hear about his life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:09):
Rachel, this was incredible. I feel like we've very much accomplished what I set out to do, which is just give people all this advice that they never have access to that, costs tens of thousands of dollars. I think we're going to help a lot of people improve their lives and their careers. Thank you so much for being here.

Rachel Lockett (01:44:26):
Absolutely. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:28):
I almost forgot to ask you two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe consider working with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Rachel Lockett (01:44:36):
Yeah, find me at lockettcoaching.com, and how can listeners be useful? Listeners should turn towards each other, build great relationships, and send CEOs and co-founders my way if they need coaching.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:48):
Thank you so much for being here.

Rachel Lockett (01:44:50):
Thanks for having me. Take care, Lenny.

# Good Strategy, Bad Strategy | Richard Rumelt

## Transcript

Richard Rumelt (00:00:00):
Don't call it strategy, call it an action agenda. It's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on mission and your vision and your values, all these things that have to be in place before you can have strategy. That's not true. Begin to try to identify the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed and what are we going to do about it? What are the coherent actions we're going to do to take these on? Okay, we're going to go after this and here's the action steps we're going to take to do that. That's the essence of what you're doing when you're thinking strategically.

Lenny (00:00:42):
Today my guest is Richard Rumelt. Richard is an absolute legend in the world of strategy. It was such an honor to have him come on the podcast. He's the author of Good Strategy Bad Strategy, which I've gifted to countless people who wanted to become more strategic. He's been mentioned so many times on this podcast. He's also the author of The Crux, his most recent book, which some consider his best book, which delves even further into his advice on how to craft a winning strategy.

(00:01:08):
Richard was a longtime professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, was on the faculty of Harvard Business School, and he's consulted on strategy with companies like Microsoft, Apple and Intel, and also with government organizations like the US Army Special Ops Command, and folks like Donald Rumsfeld. In our conversation, Richard shares the concrete elements that make a good strategy, why we'd be better off calling them action agendas rather than strategies, why every great strategy starts with a clear diagnosis of the biggest challenge that you face. Also, how to actually lay out a strategy, why organizational dynamics are often the biggest hindrance to winning strategies and so much more. I could keep going, but let me just say we cover a lot of ground in this episode and Richard shares incredibly thoughtful and deep answers to each question. I'm excited to bring you Richard Rumelt, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:58):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you'll probably find those little in-product pop-up really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature. And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible. But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of every one.

(00:02:24):
CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at CommandBar.com/Lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's CommandBar.com/Lenny.

(00:04:29):
Richard, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Richard Rumelt (00:04:33):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:35):
It is such an honor to have you on this podcast. So many guests on the podcast have mentioned you and mentioned the book. I probably bought your book for, I don't know, dozens of people over the years, and it is just so cool to have you on and to get to delve into the stuff that you teach. So thank you again for being here.

Richard Rumelt (00:04:51):
Thank you.

Lenny (00:04:51):
I thought we'd start at the beginning and then work our way up and kind of see where the conversation goes. What is the simplest way to understand a strategy? What is a strategy, and then what are the essential components of a good strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:05:05):
Well, a strategy is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge. It's a mixture of policy and action designed to deal with a challenge. The challenge could have an upside. It could be, "Oh geez, we were fooling around in the back 40 and we discovered oil, what we do?" Or it could be negative, could be that new innovation is driving us out of the market. But a challenge is the hardest strategy. The work comes from Strategos, which is Greek. The Greeks elected 10 Strategoi to serve as strategic leaders at Athens. And they were elected and they dealt with issues of the day, the Persians are invading, there's a plague in town, we need money for a new temple. And that's where the word comes to us from. It isn't just military, it wasn't in Athens. So strategy is always about dealing with an issue, a challenge, a problem. What are we going to do about global warring? What are we going to do about China wants to reunify with Taiwan?

Lenny (00:06:24):
You obviously have these very infamous famous elements of a good strategy, something you call the colonel. Can you just talk through those pieces?

Richard Rumelt (00:06:33):
Right, sure. So when I used to teach strategy for many years at Harvard and then at UCLA and other places, there's lots of ways of looking at strategy. And so years and years ago, we used to look at the [inaudible 00:06:51] and the matrix and the five forces and all of those kinds of analytical tools. And it began to dawn on me at some point that this is a strategy. These are analytical tools for analyzing the problem, for thinking about things, for looking at competition. But they're not strategy. Strategy is, one, and I started to write a book and the first chapter of the book was... the first part I wrote was the David and Goliath strategy story. And my point in writing about David and Goliath was that the surprise that David is able to beat this giant warrior, and that's a strategy story. Strategy story is about discovered strength.

(00:07:43):
It's about, oh wow, look at how they did that. Look at how he got made in five moves. That's a strategy story. Look at how Steve Jobs changed the world when people couldn't expect it. That's emotionally what a strategy story is. So I want to write about strategy. And my wife Kate asked me, "Well, do you define strategy?" I said, "Oh, it's really hard. I can't define it." And she said, "Well, you can't write a book about it if you can't define it." Because I said I had this other conceptual scheme in my head that all teachers and writers had, which is that there's a bunch of analytical tools. And this is back in 2005, 2004.

(00:08:31):
And I gradually came to the realization all strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges, and that was a basic idea going in the book. So if that's the core of it, what's the basic activity? What are you doing when you create a strategy? Well, you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with? Now, humans can't understand all of reality. No one can. So part of what a diagnosis is, is a decision about what you're going to pay attention to and the hypothesis for several hypotheses about what's going on, how do things connect together. And that's beginning of the diagnosis. And so diagnosis is an understanding of the situation that you're in. Well, that's not novel. And you can use any of those tools that are famous for that and you can try to find forces. You can do any one of a number of things to try to comprehend the situation. The world is more complicated than 2x2s, unfortunately. I was educated as an electrical engineer and my early years were spent designing spacecraft for NASA. And when I got into looking at business and business strategy stuff, I was always amazed at how unintellectual it was, that I was struggling to master Z-transforms and multiple, and yet these people are looking at 2x2s and little diagrams [inaudible 00:10:19], oh, that's what the company's about. So a rich diagnosis of the situation, but then a guiding policy.

(00:10:28):
The guiding policy is what are we going to do? Now, it's a simple thing to say, a guiding policy, and the guiding policy is sort of the strategy. It's the core of it. It's here's how we're dealing with the situation. And yet, when I say that, it flies in the face of, as I was writing that, I had a client who had 17 priorities. This is what we're doing. We have 17 priorities. And that's the opposite of policy. That's a laundry list of all the things we wish would happen over the next year. We're going to gain market share in China, we're going to cut our emissions, we're going to save energy, we're going to become safer, we're going to cut costs, all these different things that we're going to do. And they're all priorities. Now, lots of people need misuse the word priority when they're trying to do all that. You wouldn't want to be in a commercial airplane and hear the tower say to the pilot, "I'm giving priority to the following three planes on runway five." Right away, you know there's something wrong.

(00:11:50):
Well, that's the word priority, it means the first. It doesn't mean the grab back everything that you can think of that might matter. It means what's first. And so the guiding policy is sort at that level of what do we really have to do here and what are we doing and what are we not doing to deal with the diagnosis that we created?

(00:12:14):
And then the most important part of a strategy, the part that it's so easy to leave out because people like to think of strategy as this high level conceptual thing, is the coherent action. You have to do something. And what you do has to be coherent in several ways. The first way is it has to deal with the problem or the diagnosis and the guiding policy, it has to implement. It has to be coherent in that you shouldn't do things that fight each other.

(00:12:51):
You shouldn't say, "Oh, we are going to burn less oil and at the same time we're going to import more oil." It doesn't make any sense to do things that are self-contradictory. And yet, people do it. Most companies have strategic goals of increasing growth and increasing profit. Magically, that can happen in some cases. Growth and profit, they battle each other. Let's say we define profit as return on equity. If you're going to increase growth and increase return on equity, how do you do that? Because you're basically trying to invest less to get your return on equity up. Or you're going to grow and get your profit margin up. Well, how are you going to do that? You get your profit margin up and grow faster.

(00:13:52):
This is baby talk, but CEO after CEO will stand up and say, "Well, we're going to grow and we're going to make a profit." And so having coherent actions, actions that dump milk on one another is an important part of strategy. All three elements have to be there. There has to be an understanding of the situation. There has to be a guiding policy, how are we going to deal with it? And that could be a long-term sense of how we could change. You don't have to change your strategy every five minutes or every five years. If you're making Almond Joy candy bars or something, you don't really change your strategy constantly. If you're in the tech business, of course you have a shorter time horizon. And then the coherence and action is critical. And so these are the three, what I call basic elements, the kernel that if anyone in three is missing, something's wrong. It's not really a strategy, it's something else.

Lenny (00:15:04):
Awesome. Okay. Is there an example that you could give that makes these even more concrete of just, I don't know, something that comes to mind that's a quick example of a strategy that illustrates these three components?

Richard Rumelt (00:15:17):
If you're Microsoft right now and you're trying to adapt to AI, you have a diagnosis. Well, what's going on? You see the challenge of how do we adapt to it? You create a guiding policy that you're going to invest in one of the major leaders and that you're going to begin to incorporate that into your search engine. And then you have coherent actions. You actually do some of these things. It's not rocket science. The difficulty is that companies don't do that.

(00:15:55):
There are companies that say, "Well, our future is"... let's say something that's not in a software business. That's industry 4.0 for 5.0 that we're going to have... we're investing in the future of robotics and AI and even computer vision and all that. That's going to be our future. And then you see what they're doing. They've bought this company, they've bought this company, they've bought this company, and that's it. It's strategic assembly without any synthesis. So strategy's not mysterious. What's mysterious to me, what was mysterious to me and what remains mysterious to me is how so many organizational leaders don't do it. They create bad strategy. They do something that they say is strategy and then it's not.

Lenny (00:16:55):
You have a whole chapter on this, on what is a bad strategy. Can we just touch on a few of the things you see as signs that your strategy is bad or maybe it doesn't even exist?

Richard Rumelt (00:17:05):
Sure. When I wrote Good Strategy Bad Strategy, a lot of people resonated with the bad strategy. Part of the book, they wrote emails and saying, "Oh my God, thank goodness someone just finally said that these long and terminal meetings I sit through are not actually strategy." Or these documents that the company produces are not actually strategy. And they're not. Bad strategy, the standard bad strategy for a corporation is a set of profit goals or performance goals. A set of goals. Goals are the engineering of how companies work to some extent. But abstract, high-level goals, they're not strategy, they're something else. They're ambitions. And ambitions are not a strategy. A list of all the different things you wish would happen is not strategy.

(00:18:13):
I was asked to help part of the U.S. Department of Defense create a strategy for what's 17 different intelligence agencies.

Lenny (00:18:26):
Wow, how cool.

Richard Rumelt (00:18:29):
Yeah. There's 17 different intelligence agencies. And the strategy basically that these people had written said the 17 agencies should work together more effectively. Now, you don't have to be a Russian spy to see that what they're really saying is these guys aren't working together effectively and it's a problem. But they didn't say that. They said the strategy is they're going to work together more effectively. Just like the RV always comes out with our strategy is join us, meaning we're having trouble with coordinating.

(00:19:08):
But then there's nothing there about that other than this is what should happen, there should be more effective coordination. And oh, we'll have an office of coordination, put a person in charge of coordination. But there's no sensible... why is it hard to coordinate? What are the barriers to this? This has been going on for 34 years now. What's holding it back? What is a problem we have to solve? It's not there.

(00:19:37):
So I was hired to do a foundry for a company and they said, "Well, our diagnosis is not growing fast enough." Okay, let's get into that because that's not a diagnosis, that's a statement. It's a statement of value, you would like to grow faster than you are. I'd like to be taller than I am. I'd like to have more hair. You want to grow faster. Okay, so what's holding you back? And from [inaudible 00:20:19]. But saying, okay, we're going to grow, that's not a strategy.

(00:20:23):
Bad strategy also is fluff. People will use fancy words to describe their situation. Since I wrote that, the term word salad has become common. And there's a lot of word salad writing that people try to use to describe their situation. It sounds more abstract perhaps more abstract. Therefore, it's more strategic, incoherent stuff where we're going to do A, and we're going to B and those two things obviously fight one another. All those things are part of bad strategy. Bad strategy is a document or a set of intentions or a set of verbalizations where it's not a strategy. There's no diagnosis. Of course, I don't doubt that. Started out saying where United States is falling behind in education. And he's looking at the piece of the PISA test scores of 15 year olds around the world. And it's true, the United States is down, number of 30 countries in terms of the scores of our 15-year-old, in math and in general knowledge. Okay, correct statement, we're falling behind. A real diagnosis would say, because. We jumped immediately to therefore, we're going to have more people go to college than any other country. Well, having more people go to college doesn't solve the problem of 15 year olds not being able to do elementary math. Hopefully it doesn't screw up colleges everywhere. So that kind of gap, it's there, where you don't do the diagnosis. Why do we have this? We argue over diagnosis as part of politics and part of organizational politics. That's what we do, and that's important. To do a strategy, you have to resolve the argument. Why do we have a homeless explosion in Portland or Seattle or Los Angeles? And people argue about that. Some people say, "Oh, strokes." Some people say, "Oh no, housing is too expensive." There are different diagnosis. But to deal with the issue, you have to decide on the diagnosis. The politicians right now sort of decided for a few years that the problem is housing's too expensive, we're going to build housing at $700,000 a unit and give it to the all people. Okay. If you build it, they will come.

(00:23:28):
But then the next problem is, well, can't seem to build a housing. And so again, you need a new diagnosis. Why can't you build a housing? You're a rich, powerful country. Why can't you build some housing? So diagnosis is critical to understanding it. And in public policy, we argue over the diagnosis. And in organizations we argue. And unless you resolve it, you can't act. So lacking diagnosis is one of the key reasons for bad strategy. The other, the fluff and the incoherent actions are fun to describe, but they're less common. The second major source of bad strategy is mistaking goals for strategy, saying these goals are our strategy. And that leaves out so many of the important aspects.

Lenny (00:24:22):
Amazing. So just to summarize somewhat, if you're missing a diagnosis, trying to explain what exactly is wrong, it's a sign your strategy is incomplete or bad. If you're missing concrete actions, it's a sign that your strategy is incomplete or bad. There's also I think an element of coherence. The actions have to connect and there have to be a few, very few of them. I always like to think of three as a good number. Is that something you think about, the rule of thirds for actions you want to take or even the guiding policy, or is there a number that you think about just like no more than this?

Richard Rumelt (00:24:53):
A few. A few. Not too many. Not 17. It's hard. Numbers. We work best when we concentrate. We're more effective when we concentrate on a few things, a few people, a few... focus, it's the fundamental source of power and strategy. Trying to do too many different things is defocusing.

Lenny (00:25:18):
I think there's this quote in your book that I think is, and this may be paraphrasing, each time you say yes, you risk turning a nascent good strategy into a bad strategy.

Richard Rumelt (00:25:28):
Yes. Focus is... when I was nine years old, I was at summer camp and I had my parents sent me a magnifying glass and I was out there using the sun to try to cook a piece of wood. I think I had a piece of cloth that I was trying to burn, wasn't having much luck. The magnifying glass focuses the sun's rays on the spot. Counselor came over and he said, "Try this," and he pulled out a black thread from his T-shirt, put it down. And I focused the sun's rays hard, popped out. So stupid little story. But to burn that black thread, there has to be a source of power, the sun. There has to be a focus, that's the magnifying that to the power. And it has to be a target that can be affected. It has to be a black thread, not white thread. And that sequence is part of strategic action. You need a source of power. I say power, I don't say advantage or efficiency.

(00:26:53):
I say power because there are different ways in which power is exhibited and you have to focus the power on a target that can actually be affected or achieved. And this is real simple logic, but it's a discipline to focus power on a target that you can affect. Take American power and say we're going to change China's trajectory and Russia's trajectory and our own and to name all the 30 countries around the world that we're trying... we're diffusing our efforts because they're not the same. They're going in different directions. Obvious when you say it, not so obvious as you live it, because like any organization, like any big organization, US government has different interests. They're pursuing different interests funded for different purposes with different clientele. And so there's gradually a diffusion-

Richard Rumelt (00:28:00):
And so there's gradually a diffusion of effort. One of the big issues in strategy is simply the organization, complex organizations particularly. You have a hard time focusing energy because of all the different interests.

Lenny (00:28:21):
Yeah. Actually I want to talk about both those things, so I'm glad that you teed them up. Let's talk about power. What is this idea of power and how does that play into strategy? Why is it so important? And then what are some examples of power that people can think about when they're trying to think about implementing and adding a power to their strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:28:40):
Well, in a competitive situation, the fundamental aspect of power is something that's going to give you some sort of advantage. Usually it's in asymmetry of some kind. If two fighters are equally balanced or two horses are equally fetched or two armies are equally... And they meet in competition, it's 50/50. Who knows what will happen. For a strategy you need to exploit in asymmetry of some kind. You hear a little faster. Or they're a little... Something has to be different between now and between things. So that's the beginning of power, is asymmetry. We can think of it as leverage, but sometimes think first is a source of power.

(00:29:43):
Being first to recognize something can be a source of power. Having a reputation of a certain kind gives you some power that someone doesn't have that reputation doesn't have. On the other hand, having a well-established reputation of a certain type can be the opposite of power because people don't expect you to be able to do something new. They expect you to be able to do this, but not that. Having relationships can be a source of power. When Gerstner took over IBM as it was failing in the face of the microprocessor revolution, he recognized that their primary asset, their source of power, was that they were respected and they had [inaudible 00:30:38] into every large corporation on the planet. Nobody else had that as an actual producing company. And so he said, we're going to embrace our customers. Bear hug our customers. We're going to serve our customers.

(00:30:58):
That's our source of our power. That's our leverage. That's the synergy. Now the world begins to change and computing begins to move to the cloud. And IBM's customers, the largest companies in the world, are the most hesitant to do that, because they've got the big IT departments that don't want move to cloud. And so small companies move to the cloud and the big companies are, well, it's insecure in the cloud. We'd have to lay off people. We have these big machines we like to run.

(00:31:39):
And so IBM then becomes disadvantaged in the new world because it inherits this big company orientation and that lagging behind. So the opposite side of power is what you inherit. From [inaudible 00:32:01] can be the wrong thing. But a source of power is that. A source of power can be an invention, a source of power can be a particular customer base that you have identified. It doesn't last forever, power, but all the different sources of advantage that are sometimes transitory and sometimes permanent are sources of power that a company has to use to compete and survive.

Lenny (00:32:35):
I imagine people listening are just like, oh man, I got to figure out the power, the advantage that I have with my business. Is there any advice you could share about helping people figure out where their power might lie?

Richard Rumelt (00:32:46):
That's a good question, Lenny. So how do you figure it out? So I start, as I said earlier, with the symmetries. In what way is my company different than other companies? In what way is my team different? What do we know that other people don't know? What do we possess that other people don't possess? So there has to be some asymmetry to create competitive power, there has to be something different.

(00:33:17):
Sometimes you have to redefine your space down small amount. Then you can actually see it, particularly a smaller company that doesn't have worldwide power, has power in a certain marketplace or a certain set of customers or sometimes it's not customers. Sometimes the power isn't who you can bring in and hire. So if you invented ChatGPT, you can bring in the smartest AI people for a year or two because all the smart AI people want to work at the cutting edge with the current winner.

(00:33:58):
Then they'll start to arguing with each other and in fight and there'll be all sorts of embarrassing personnel things going on and someone else can grab that position, if it's not well managed. Business is exciting in that sense that it's not stable. It's not just as it was when I was first studying it. It's not just IBM and Sears and AT&T forever. There's a constant changing of the guard.

Lenny (00:34:30):
For better or worse.

Richard Rumelt (00:34:32):
For better. Because if you look at government, there is no changing of the guard and they get stultified.

Lenny (00:34:38):
Makes sense. So in your book, you have this whole list of types of power. I'll just read them real quick. Leverage, proximate, objectives, chain link systems, design, focus, growth, advantages, dynamics, inertia, entropy. There's also the book, obviously The Seven Powers, that a lot of people are aware of. I guess how do you think about just the spectrum of types of power you can have? Is this it? Are there others?

Richard Rumelt (00:35:02):
I started to make a list there in the book and I wrote up a bit about chain link systems and today, I mean the power that new business models are exploiting is the power of the user base. What we called years ago, network effects, where the more users you have, the more useful a product is. So I think the idea of network effects first arose with the telehealth system, which the idea was that you don't want to be connected to a telephone system that only connects to two other people. It's not all that useful. It's got to connect to the world to be useful.

(00:35:43):
And my colleague Marvin Lieberman was taking the economics course at Harvard University at the same time that Bill Gates was a student in that classroom. Professor's going on about network effects and of course that's what catapulted him, had his software, MS DOS at the time. Not MS DOS, he had something called basic that... The network effect was huge. He got angry about the network effect because people wouldn't pay him. They kept stealing it and using it and pretty soon everybody in the microcomputer industry had M Basic.

(00:36:27):
Then we get the network effects from not just software, but user base is now with the internet and so you get network effects with big social media. No one wants to be on a social media if only three other people are on. So having a large network...

(00:36:50):
Amazon. Get big fast because the economics are amazing. So we used to say, well, in a department store, economics are that you're saving people the cost of going out of the store and walking down the street to another store. So now it's all in one place. Supermarkets, the same thing. But look at a thing like Amazon where there the ease of shopping on Amazon keeps people from leaving it and going to another website. Now other websites have gotten better and better and some of that is less strong than it used to be and this is a constant struggle with it. Nevertheless, the size of the user bench there is an important source of a symmetry and power for the people that have come out ahead and won that battle for this round, this five years to 10 years. How long does it last before some other thing begins to take precedent. And now we have two-sided markets, whether it's credit cards or places where both buyers and sellers get together.

(00:38:01):
And so here these big forces that companies are playing with right now are these network effects.

(00:38:10):
And when the new generative AI, we have the possibility of stronger effects than we've ever seen before, but we don't know yet. But the suspicion is that size is what matters, that the size of the data that you could put into the learning algorithm is going to make your AI better. And so again, a big... It's going to matter.

(00:38:43):
Just think of Google and their ability to improve search based upon all the searches that go on on their base every day. It's very hard for Bing to catch up because Bing doesn't have as much data to train on. And so unless there's some new innovation there that isn't just the amount of data, the leader again has this asymmetry working for it. Now, the way you get around all that is by being specialized, by owning a particular approach that isn't the market leader's approach. And it's always been that way in business, but our attention is often attracted by these giants.

(00:39:34):
So yeah, sources of power today where we look at the new business models that are part of the fabric are these network effects and things like that that are very, very strong. And people are trying to get those in startups and in small firms within a certain market space and build it as fast as possible to get ahead of others. There's been venture capital available to try those experiments and some of them work and some of them don't, but that's this new age we're in now, where the speed of building a market position with network effects is a dominant game in the tech space.

Lenny (00:40:25):
I feel like Twitter is the ultimate example of the power of network effects, especially recently where if you think about it, everything about Twitter has changed and it still continues to run. You laid off 80% of people at the company, they changed the name, they changed the domain basically, the algorithms changed. I don't know what is still the same.

Richard Rumelt (00:40:45):
How can you lay off 80% of the people and it still runs? I mean you got to wonder.

Lenny (00:40:49):
I love Twitter. I'm on there all the time. I feel like it's never been better, which is kind of wild.

Richard Rumelt (00:40:54):
Twitter's fascinating. I mean I tune into it every couple of days and see what's going on and it is just an amazing rumble of opinions and statements. It's much more interesting than it was five years ago.

Lenny (00:41:11):
There's a lot of diagnosing and not a lot of concrete actions. But anyway, I wanted to come back to the element about power. I think when people are thinking about power, it may not be clear where that plugs into the diagnosis, the guiding policy and the coherent actions. Where should you be thinking and implementing this idea of where my power is when you're laying out your strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:41:35):
To undertake a strategy that you think will work, you've got to have a reason that it makes sense and that reason is derived from some source of power, some source of advantage. Ultimately, your power or your advantage is something based in history that has the feel of reputation, or institutional skill, or it's some kind of symmetry or knowledge that you have that others don't have. So it's a resource that you can use that your competitors or others don't have equal access to because you've either have mastered it or you own it or you inherited from the past.

(00:42:45):
All those things are sources of the power that you use to make it not an even bet. So when you walk into a casino, well maybe if you play poker with skill, you can expect to make some money, but the general casino games, you're going to expect to lose. And in business, statistically, if you come to me and you say, I'm going to open a new restaurant. What should my strategy be? My answer would be don't open a restaurant. Invest in the S&P 500 because the statistics are that new restaurants fail. So what makes you think that you can succeed? Oh, I really want to succeed. Not good enough. I trained under a chef who's been very successful. Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more.

(00:43:50):
So there, where's the asymmetry here? Where's the source of power where you go from the odds... The standard odds in this game are against people where you think the odds are in your favor.

(00:44:05):
That's the source of power we're looking for. We're looking for this information, this skill, this thing in the field, the way the resources are arranged, that's going to give you this edge. And some of that is sort of part of the situation and some of it's how you shape and focus your actions. Strategy tends to be surprising when we see it, when we see it work, and surprising because we don't expect it. We expect people to bumble around. We expect Arby's to bumble around. We expect nation states to bumble around. We don't expect them to execute coherent strategies.

(00:44:54):
The United States went to Afghanistan and it wanted to catch Osama bin Laden, but at the same time they didn't want to put an army in the shield to actually catch him because it would the embarrassing to have that many Americans in the field. That's what happened in Tora Bora. The Secretary of Defense said, no, we don't want to make it look like we're taking over the country, so they didn't try to catch him as hard as they could.

(00:45:22):
And we want to have the education of women and we want to have a democracy and we want to have a long list that we would have no opium production, but at the same time, our allies are the opiate producers. It was the Taliban that got rid of opiate. Americans didn't do it.

(00:45:44):
So we had all these different objectives. It doesn't work. You need to have a focus on something achievable. What's achievable? [inaudible 00:46:03] Nation-building is hard stuff. It takes a century. Afghanistan, I'm off on a tangent here with Afghanistan, but it's a really interesting subject. Afghanistan was a warlord society, a bunch of different warlords running the place. Well, what's a warlord society? Where else do we look for an analogies? Well, we look at [inaudible 00:46:32] in 1650. You look at France in 1300. You can look at Japan before the modern era. These are warlord societies. Well, how did they go from that to being a coherent government that maybe wasn't democratic at first, but still, there was a government instead of just as much war. It took some [inaudible 00:46:59] to conquer all the rest.

(00:47:02):
And then it took a long time for them to put in the structure itself of government and then maybe became a democracy. Maybe not, but that's the process. It's not like you just go in there and say, you're now no longer a warlord with society because we've decreed it.

(00:47:19):
I don't know. You're going to ask me more questions about what it is people should know and how do you get these sources of power? How do you get these insights? I'm a big fan of history. I'm a big fan of knowing things about what happened. Business history, biographies, war history.

(00:47:42):
If you don't have access to other times and other places and other things that have happened, it's very hard to think strategically about the situation you're in because there isn't a science of strategy. It's not like physics. It's not like engineering where we can write down the equations of stress on a beam and say, how thick does the beam have to be? It's not like that. A lot of it is based on analogy to previous human experience.

Lenny (00:48:16):
That is an amazing insight. Is there anything you find most rich and valuable in terms of history periods, empires, stories that you find most connects as an analogy? Is there anything you find consistently is useful or is it just read as much as you can and you'll often find something in there?

Richard Rumelt (00:48:36):
Yeah, the further back we go in history, the leaner. It's less rich. The best histories are written by the people at the moment it's happening or very soon after. History books and things like that are someone's opinion. But our own history here in the United States, we have pretty good documentation about what went on in the Indian War, why we had these big cycles of economic growth and then depression. We had depressions in 1840 and after the Civil War and there was another huge panic depression in the 1890s. [inaudible 00:49:26]. A lot of people don't even know that these things happen. How did they happen? And of course everybody knows about the Great Depression of 1929, 30's, but go back and how did that happen? When did that happen? And you'll hear professors opine about why it happened, but there's no agreement. The biggest economic fact of the last 150 years, you don't know why it happened.

(00:49:58):
Go back and you can go online and look at the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times from that era and start in September of 1928 and just look at the front page every day, which I've done, and you can see it unfold and it's a surprise to everyone. There goes, well, Ford just laid off the people, but it's temporary. They'll hire them back. This economist says, well, it's a temporary this. It'll come back. And it gradually gets worse and worse and worse and there's no understanding of it. There's not a lot of analysis. And so you got Milton Friedman saying, oh, it's monetary. They didn't loosen up the money supply. You got other people saying things. But put yourself back at that moment in time and see what people saw and realize that no one understood what was happening and to form their own opinions.

(00:51:10):
That's the diagnosis skill or that's the feeling. Now, let's suppose you fall off a boat. You're on a cruise ship and you fall and you're now in the ocean. It's terrifying and it's confusing and there's waves and there's water and I don't want to drown. And you look around and you see, oh, here's a floating piece of wood. Let me grab it. Wow, that feels a lot better. That's how it feels when you look at a confusing situation and the first idea of how to understand it comes to mind. Oh, yeah, I've got this piece of wood. Now I'm not drowning. But is it right?

(00:52:05):
The most important intellectual tool we have is to think again, to say, okay, I came up with this diagnosis because I thought this and I thought this. Is there another way to look at this situation? Is there a bigger piece of wood over there than I can grab onto? That's the hard thing. When I looked at the Great Depression what I saw is the [inaudible 00:52:35]. So if you look at capital goods, most capital goods that the public buys, the adoption curve goes up like this, it peaks, and it declines and then it comes back up again. Because there comes a point where everybody who can afford one has got one, and then the new sales drop off. And in my mind, that's what I saw. 1929, everybody could afford a car, had a car, and the auto industry began... First signs of the Great Depression were in the auto industry.

(00:53:15):
So that was my play that I read. Now I don't see anybody else writing about that, but that's the exercise and to exercise your mind about trying to understand complex situations. It's best to go back. You don't have to [inaudible 00:53:34] to the great Depression, but you can go and try and find situations that other people have to deal with and look at as much data as you can and to practice that. That's what education should be in a business school. It's not. They teach theories now because it's so much easier to teach a theory than intellectual structure.

Lenny (00:53:58):
It's also a lot more work, reading a lot of books and history and studying and thinking.

Richard Rumelt (00:54:04):
Oh, [inaudible 00:54:05]. I had a colleague at UCLA who assigned a book to MBA students and they went to the dean and had him kicked out of the course because of a book. He wants us to read a book.

Lenny (00:54:16):
Oh man. It sounds like you have another book in you writing about the Great Depression and what really happened there.

Richard Rumelt (00:54:22):
Maybe.

Lenny (00:54:23):
Oh, man. Exciting.

(00:55:24):
I wanted to zoom back in on something very tactical. So say you're a product manager listening to this that has to write a strategy for their team. Say it's like they're working on the onboarding experience of their product and they're about to sit down and start to write out the strategy for their team. And say they have a general idea of what they want to do. Do you have any advice for just how to lay out a strategy? As you talk I think of there's a section. Diagnosis, a section. Guiding principles, a section. Actions, and then there's power in there and the guiding policy. Is that how you lay it out? Do you have any advice for how to write this out?

Richard Rumelt (00:55:59):
I wrote the crutch because I felt that.

Richard Rumelt (00:56:00):
The Crux because I felt that that kernel was not sufficiently sharp enough for peak. And even in The Crux, if I could rewrite The Crux book, I would, maybe, write it a little differently today, a whole couple of things I would change. First, it's really important to understand the challenge, the problem. Diagnosis is not merely understanding the world, it's understanding the challenge you face. What makes it hard? So the question I ask client is exactly that. What makes it hard? Client will tell me, "Oh, we want to open up business in Australia. It's a market we haven't tapped." And I'll say, "Okay, so why are you and I talking about that? You're the CEO. Just tell somebody to do it. What makes it hard?" "Oh, well, we don't know anybody in Australia and they kicked us out." If you push, he'll tell you why it's hard.

(00:57:18):
But that understanding hasn't been percolated into a strategy. Part of the problem is that the concept of strategy has been so beaten up by thousands, hundreds of books, and thousands of more websites that people have a hard time trying to figure out how to create a strategy, because they're drawn up, down, left, right. So my two pieces of advice, anybody that's actually trying to do this is, A, state the problem, and, B, don't call it a strategy, call it an action agenda, that you're not creating a strategy, you're creating an action agenda. What are we going to do about this problem? That's essence of what you're doing. When you're thinking strategically, you're recognizing the problem and you have an action agenda to deal with it. It's not five years out and 10 years out. It's not your general mission to build a better world, it's none of that.

(00:58:43):
All of that is a different literature form. There's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on how your mission, and your vision, and your values, and all these things that have to be in place before you can have a strategy. And that's not true. It's a different model. I start now with ambitions because people want to put ambitions in place. They get angry with me. I don't allow them to talk about their ambitions. So we start with ambitions, and okay, you have all these ambitions. I write in The Crux that when I was 25, I wanted to be a top business school professor. I wanted to be on Fortune directors. I wanted to drive a Morgan Drophead Plus 4. I wanted to climb the great mountains of the world. I wanted to learn to fly an aircraft. I wanted to marry a beautiful woman and have successful children. I wanted to have a townhouse on the [inaudible 01:00:00] of Paris. All and all, I had a lot of ambitions.

(01:00:05):
That's not strategy. We all have ambitions, and every company should have ambitions. If we look at all those ambitions, and let's say I'm 25 years old, well, what's keeping me from reaching them all? "Well, I'm not ready to join Fortune directors. I'm not experienced enough." Okay, so I put that over here. "I can't afford the pen." Okay, put it over here. "How about the ambitions that you have any chance of making progress?" So now, well, beautiful woman. "Yeah, I don't know any, maybe I ought to meet a few." "Well, you can do something about that."

(01:00:52):
So which of your ambitions can you begin to make progress towards reaching, and what's holding you back? What are the barriers? What are the problems? So I approach the question of the problem now through the filter of the ambition, that these ambitions, fine, let's accept them all, and which one can you actually make some progress on today? And what's making that hard? What are the challenges? So you're choosing a challenge. You're choosing, of the possible challenges you could face up to, you can't do them all. So there's a focus thing. You're choosing which challenge to focus on, and that challenge has to be, A, important, and, B, it has to be achievable.

(01:01:48):
It has to be something that you can address. It has to be an addressable challenge. And so the search for an action agenda, I'm not calling it a strategy, is this balance between problems that are important because they're close to your ambition and problems that you can actually address and do something about. And that overlap then becomes the choice you make. "Okay, we're going to go after this and here's the action steps we're going to take to do that." And if it's a big company, the action steps may extend over two or three years. Smaller company, took [inaudible 01:02:32] year, six months to a year. These are things we're going to do, not goals we're going to achieve. These are things we're going to do, action steps. That's sort of the way I put it together today, which is slightly different than the way it's put together in The Crux.

Lenny (01:02:49):
Yeah, I love this advice. That's such a simpler way of thinking about strategy. It's an action agenda. "Here's the things we're actually going to do." And then it starts with the challenge. And just to talk about The Crux briefly, The Crux is named after this concept in mountain climbing of the hardest point of the mountain climb where people, if they get past that, it's all downhill. And I think basically the point there is focus on the most challenging, like the biggest challenge that you need to overcome to achieve these ambitions you're describing. Is that roughly the way to think about it?

Richard Rumelt (01:03:21):
Yeah, yeah, and the idea comes from a design, and it comes from climbing, because I used to be a climber, a rock climber, and a snow climber, and a crux in a climb is the hardest part, the hardest pitch or a pitch, the hardest move is the crux of that piece. And then the basic advice to a climber is if you can't do the crux, don't do the climb, because you're going to fall off there. Now that's not exactly true, because you can try it over and over again until you get it. But in general, particularly if you're looking at an alpine climb, you better not take it on a climb where you can't handle the crux. That's why people go bouldering. The [inaudible 01:04:06] still up to him [inaudible 01:04:08] crux.

(01:04:11):
And so that's what the concept of the crux comes from. Now in business, the crux is the hardest part of the problem. And from the design point of view, the skilled designers, whether they're an engineer or an architect, what else? There's usually a challenge. I. M. Pei was hired to take a look at the Louvre in Paris, and they had a dusty parking lot in the center of this giant palace that had become a museum, and they wanted an entrance to Louvre there. And the problem is he didn't want it, they didn't want a new building that would obscure the Louvre itself. The building itself is part of the story, it's part of the scene. And yet at the same time, they needed to have an entrance, because the entrance at that time was off on the side wall.

(01:05:24):
And you looked at the situation, and the competing needs, and the [inaudible 01:05:31]. And he had an insight into, "Well, build a transparent building, build a building out of glass, so that you see through to the Louvre, it doesn't obscure." And of course, if you can build a rectangular building out of glass, the top will get dirty. So [inaudible 01:05:55] out of glass. Now, that design insight is something that software engineers, hardware engineers, mechanical engineers, base science engineers like I was, experienced, when we look at a dilemma and we try to focus on what makes this hard. And then by focusing on the difficulty, we see a way around it. Elon Musk focused on, "Well, why is it so hard to reuse a rocket?" And it's so hard because as it comes back into the planet at 18,000 miles an hour, it burns up in the atmosphere, or we have to spend a lot of money on heat shields. And at some instant, he said to himself, "Well, why not, like science fiction, just turn it around and have it land on its rocket?" "Well, there's not enough fuel." "Well, why aren't we carrying more fuel?" So SpaceX, when I was designing, I was a conceptual designer, but machine that became Voyager and went out past the planets into interstellar space where it's floating around right now. Well, one of the problems is how do you know where Jupiter is? " It's right there." "Okay, but how do you know where it is, plus or minus 100 miles? How do you know exactly where it is? When we set a mission to Mars, we were off by 500 miles. So Jupiter, how do we know exactly where it is?" Because we can look at it through our telescopes so we can look at it from the right side of our orbit and the left side of our orbit. But still, there was a couple thousand miles error in that. That's too much. And then studying that problem, the simple solution suddenly flashed, and I wish I could claim it was mine, and it wasn't, which is, "Oh, take a picture of it once we're halfway there. We'll send that picture back and we'll see it against the distant stars. And now we'll have a triangulation, know where it is." So designers experience this sense of focusing on the crux of the problem, the hard part, and then seeing a way through. And that's strategy. Strategy isn't picking a strategy out of a list of common strategies. It's looking at the problem, what makes that problem hard, and seeing a way to solve it.

(01:08:54):
Now it's called insight, and insight is scary. It's scary because it's not guaranteed to happen. We want to innovate, but we're scared of insight. We want to be the first, but we'd like to pick our strategy out of a list of common strategies for being first. We want to beat the market, but we don't want to study enough to have an insight. So insight is critical. Insight is not magical. It comes from immersing yourself in the nature of the problem. And you will have, at some point, an insight about how to deal with it. It doesn't always come when we want it to. It can come while you're driving the car, it can come the next day. It can come in the shower. Charles Darwin reports that his insight into the nature of revolution came as he stepped off a carriage into the village green somewhere. Boom, suddenly, he said, "Oh, yeah, it's obvious." It's like how we raise animals, we breed the strongest. "Sure, why was that so hard for me to see?"

Lenny (01:10:14):
So I think one of the big takeaways here is that if you want to get better at strategy or be more successful with how you think about strategy, spend a lot more time on diagnosing the problem and finding the biggest challenge that is keeping you from what you're trying to achieve. And your insight might come the more you immerse [inaudible 01:10:30].

Richard Rumelt (01:10:30):
Yeah, and call it an action agenda, "Here's what we're going to do." Not, "Here's all the things we wish would happen."

Lenny (01:10:39):
I love it. You mentioned this point that some of the biggest challenges to executing a strategy is organizational dynamics, and politics is a part of that. Is there anything you could share for folks to help them through that? You talked about one of the biggest challenges, people just want to keep adding more priorities. There's all these needs. Everyone wants to include their thing in the strategy. Is there anything people can do to improve how this works?

Richard Rumelt (01:11:04):
Typically, I'll say typically, we need hierarchy of power, because there has to be some mechanism for deciding what we're going to do. And there's people with different interests and different private interests and public interests. And somehow, there has to be a choice about putting some of these aside and doing this, that you can't say, "Our strategy is to do everything that everybody wants to do." That's what happens when you form a committee in a city and you say, "What's our city strategy?" They say, "Oh, we're going to paint the park benches. We're going to clean up the grass, we're going to build a new this, we're going to..."

(01:11:49):
They have a [inaudible 01:11:49] that stuff, everything they're going to do with that. And anybody who raised their hand and says, "Well, what about the birds? Can we..." "Oh, yeah, let's put that in, too," that doesn't go anywhere. So we, inside organizations, people have different opinions. So that's part, they have interests that they may not state clearly.

(01:12:24):
I interviewed Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, while we were invading Iraq, second time, and I was actually interviewing about budget matters, but he asked me, "Well, what do you do, professor?" And I said, "Well, I do strategy." And he said, "Well, strategy, that's a hard subject." He said, "I've got people here in the Defense Department who have an expert on anything. You want to know the clan structure in Iraq, we've got people who know. We want to know the weather, we've got people to know. You want to know how many [inaudible 01:13:05] we can fly in 24 hours, people who know. I got anything you want to know, we've got someone who knows about it, but they all disagree. And each have their own private agenda. They have a contract they want to get, they have a company they want to support, they have a conceptual idea they want to push."

(01:13:25):
So every little bit of information comes with an agenda, sometimes obvious, sometimes hidden. And how do you put all this stuff together to come up with a strategy? He says, "Do you academics have a solution to this?" And I said, "No, we don't. We don't know much more than, what, 2,000, 3,000 years ago, which is you put five to eight smart people in a room and you tell them to come up with something." But his question is at the heart of what I call a foundry, which is how do you get a group of people to coalesce around an action agenda?

(01:14:11):
And what process would you use and how do you do that? It's a different question than, "What should our strategy be?" The question is, "Well, how should you go about creating a strategy? Should you ask the product manager to write an account, or should you ask the CEO to come up with it? Should you hire a consultant? How do you do this?" In my experience, working with companies, is that the senior executives have to do this. And my experience is that the senior executives know pretty much everything you need to know to do this, that you don't need consulting firms to come in and analyze everything that you do. Yes, you'll gain some insight if they come in and do a competitive analysis, and a customer analysis, and all of that. But the basic issues, the challenges you're facing, they know that. It's not mysterious. They know all that stuff, but they disagree about the importance of different things. And more importantly, they occupy positions of power that, if we go this way, this is going to be hurt. And if we go this way, they're [inaudible 01:15:34] more money for that.

(01:15:36):
And so their interests are not aligned, which is part of what Phil was referring to. And so the problem of strategy inside an organization is diversity of interest and fear of action. Because action, when you do something in an organization of any size, it involves people changing what they do. It involves changing power relationships among humans in some way, that someone who's been the alpha maybe is not the alpha anymore, someone else is the alpha. This is heavy stuff. And this is why we have a hierarchy, because someone in the end has to say, "It's going to be this way." And people are hesitant to do that, CEOs are hesitant to do that. More so today than when I was a young man. It's become hard for people to do this. If you go to the bookstore and look at the management section in bookstore, most of it's about leadership.

(01:16:56):
And the leadership is mostly about perfecting yourself. It's not about beating anybody, but the theory is that if you perfect yourself and somehow rays come out of your head and people will follow you, because you're so magnetic, and you're so perfect, and you're so wonderful, and you're so insightful, and that people will follow you, you won't ever have to say, "[inaudible 01:17:19], do that." It's so embarrassing to tell somebody what to do.

(01:17:24):
And so this is the world we live in today, where one of the problems in doing strategy is that it's somehow been displaced by this literary form about mission, and management is being displaced by leadership, which is the idea that the leader has a vision and people... It happened in the '80s. There's a whole literature there about transformational leadership that is percolated through the system, and those, I'm not against leadership, but you have to tell people at some point, "We're going to do this, and we're going to do it this way, and Bob's going to be in charge of this aspect, and Joan's going to be in charge of that aspect." And there's a hesitancy to make those choices, because that's part of the action agenda.

Lenny (01:18:23):
So the takeaway there is essentially have a decider. It makes me think of, actually, of George Bush. You talked about Rumsfeld, but George Bush's famous quote, " I'm the decider." I don't know if you remember that?

Richard Rumelt (01:18:33):
Yeah, that's true. One of the things we see in government particularly is presidents have a hard time getting advice, because they surround themselves with people who want to please them. Number one, we rarely.,, It used to be, I remember during Woodrow Wilson's administration, when he decided to take some hard action, the [inaudible 01:18:58], and he had to do something, [inaudible 01:19:00], and the Secretary of State disagreed and quit. "Right, that's it. Quit. I disagree." Wow, don't see that so much anymore. All the people, organizations get frozen because of the difficulty of changing positions of interest and power in [inaudible 01:19:29].

Lenny (01:19:30):
Humans are complicated.

Richard Rumelt (01:19:34):
Well, if you look at Nokia, one of the big examples of strategic errors, Nokia was the leading phone maker in the world world, and then somehow it lost its ability to compete. And interesting question, there's been a fair amount of research on this, is how did that happen? One way it happened was they replaced the engineers who used to run the company with lawyers and accountants. Nothing wrong with lawyers and accountants, but they didn't have a feel for this hardware, software set of issues. And another was they put in a matrix organization that so diffused power inside the organization that nobody was actually in charge of anything in particular. I'm exaggerating, but the CEO kept pounding the desk and saying, "Apple's coming out with a smartphone and you have a touchscreen, and somebody here should make one of those." So there was no one in authority to do such a thing.

Lenny (01:20:40):
Maybe a final question on the other end of the spectrum, from an Nokia, from a startup founder's perspective, what is a strategy and what should a strategy look like if you're just a founder, pre-product market fit, just trying to figure out where you want to go? What should a strategy look like there? Do you even need a strategy?

Richard Rumelt (01:20:57):
Well, you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty When you're a founder in a startup, you're making a bet. You're making a bet like an oil well [inaudible 01:21:09] say, "I bet there's oil under this ground. We're going to drill, we're going to find it." There's a certain amount of bet that's going on, and you should be clear about the nature of the bet. The reality is going to be revealed to you in bits and pieces as time passes, whether a certain approach is going to work or not. What we find doing research on startups, Silicon Valley startups, is they start out typically aiming at a particular product market solution. And the idea that you have in your head is, "There's a set of customers who want A, would like to have A, are being denied A, but we have a way of giving them A," something, a product or a service.

(01:22:02):
Now, some people, they aren't that even advanced. They basically say, "I know how to make something and I'm going to try to sell it." You know, [inaudible 01:22:10] approach. Well, if you have any chance of succeeding, you have [inaudible 01:22:17], you have target market, and you have a solution to the target market's problem in mind, and now you're going to go after it. And the research that we have done on the startups is that generally it doesn't work.

(01:22:33):
But the ones that survive and prosper switch. They say, "Well, it isn't that customer, it's a different customer. You should walk from that customer. Oh, and that customer wants a slightly different product," and they switch over a period of a year or two period, bang, bang, until something begins to click, and they begin to grow, and begin to add functions and assets. So there's a search, there's a search like a truffle hound searching for the truffle that's going on.

(01:23:05):
And you've got to be able to think, you've got to be of two minds. Like so many things in business, when you're doing this, you've got to be of two minds. You've got to be convinced of the certainty that you're going to win, and you've got to be willing to shift when things aren't working, and that's a double-jointed exercise that some people can do and some people can't. It's almost a human skill to both commit and to be willing to move. But it's a bet. You should be clear in your own mind about the nature of the situation, the technology that you're betting on. Now, sometimes it's evolving so fast, like generative AI is right now, that you can't be sure.

Richard Rumelt (01:24:04):
... That you're going to take a position, where do you think things are going to be in a year? And that's very, very entrepreneurial, very edgy stuff, but it's not... Go back and read about the beginnings of the electrical industry or the beginnings of aviation or the beginnings of motorize this and beginnings of cars. People had to bet about what this industry would look like. The first cars were electric cars. The first car sold in quantity in the United States were electric delivery vehicles used downtown in cities, delivery [inaudible 01:24:49] produce. They were electric, ran on batteries. That was the bet.

(01:24:53):
All that changed with the First World War. The United States built thousands and thousands of gasoline powered trucks to go to Europe, wrestled through the mud, and people came back knowing how to fix those engines, and those trucks got sold off as wholesale to farmers, who used them on their fields, and we had the gasoline to take off like a rocket. So, you cannot predict the future. There's an Arab saying that I like that says, "He who forecasts the future lies, even if he tells the truth." We're making bets. That's what business is, we're making a bet. And if we're a rich company, we can make a bet and afford to be wrong. But if we're a startup, we have to be fast, we have to adapt as the information comes in, and that's the nature of the story. The action agenda has to be quick adaptation to changing conditions.

Lenny (01:26:06):
I feel like you have another book here where you could adapt a lot of this wisdom to startups. I'm looking at my notes from what we were talking about earlier, and you have this point of when you're trying to write out a... You call it an action agenda, not a strategy, you're basically on the hunt for a big problem and an important problem and an achievable problem. And essentially you can boil that down to that is the job of a founder to find an important problem and achievable problem and then solve it for a lot of people.

Richard Rumelt (01:26:34):
I like that. The other exercise I used to take my students through was what I called value denial. Now, what is it that you should be able to buy but you can't? And at the time I taught this stuff, I was upset because I would lose my baggage on a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Paris, so I'd like to buy baggage... Sure, so I'd like to buy... How do you get your baggage not to be lost? Now, with security systems in place, it's less, let's call it. Can I find someone to help me remodel my home that's going to be on time and I'll bet you not available. Can't buy it at any price. If I live in Hong Kong and I'm going to the airport, I can drop my luggage off downtown and it arrives at the airport checked in. I don't have to lug it. Why can't I do that in the US? Value denial.

(01:27:44):
And then engineering, thinking about how something ought to be, a channel, salesforce.com got started was, "Well, how should this be? It shouldn't be a computer, it should be a webpage. It should be like Amazon where it has books." And so, that was the beginning of salesforce.com. I asked a group of students once to think about the perfect window because it's physical, something we could think about in the classroom without doing a lot of research. Well, what's the perfect window? A perfect window should be transparent, should let the sun in. All right, so it's let in the light, but not all the time. Sometimes you want to watch the television. So, it should also darken, drapes for shades. It should let in the air, good, but not the bugs, a screen. It should let in the air, but not the noise. That's a little harder.

(01:28:57):
So, you go down a list of things that a window should do. It should let in light, but not light. It should let in air, but not the noise. It should not let in air when we don't want it. It should not let in the bugs. It should maybe have shutters or not shutters. And so I said, "How could you design the perfect window? What would it look like?" And there's some kids at MIT that had developed this thing that lets in air, but keeps out the noise, these little auditory filters keep out noises in certain frequencies. Well, we don't have a perfect window, but think about it, windows could be better than they are.

(01:29:39):
And that's a real simple device that we're all familiar with, and look around you, look at everything you've got and say, well, "How shouldn't it be?" And there's opportunities there. Now, a lot of the times, the opportunities are blocked by the lack of certain materials or regulation. Regulators have decided that you can't sell a car in the United States unless it goes through a dealer. So, that holds back innovation in that business. And so plumbing, how should plumbing actually work?

(01:30:20):
Well, there's a whole surge of rules about how plumbing works and electrical things work. You can't innovate there very easily because of the underwriter's labs and the unions, and a lot of the stuff that's done in home construction is there to create jobs, not to reduce costs. So, how do you get around that? So, you have to look at places where it's possible to innovate first of all, but the idea of how do you make something better? How do you make it perfect? What would the perfect light switch look like, and so on? These are real simple, silly questions, but they lead to new businesses and new firms if you pursue them.

Lenny (01:31:03):
I love how full of startup ideas you are. I also think we came up with at least two new books that you can write. I think you're going to have a lot of work to do after this conversation. Final question, is there anything you want to leave listeners with or take away? Is there a final nugget you just want to share for folks?

Richard Rumelt (01:31:19):
I want to share with you that strategy's not mysterious, that I've spent my life studying strategy, pursuing it, consulting on it, writing about it. It's not mysterious. It's about solving problems. It's about solving the most important problem you're facing that you actually do something about. You don't have to be Sun Tzu to come up with a strategy, but you need to be focused on something doable and be consistent about it. I have a long list of things not to do. There's a fourth book that I'm thinking about writing called Don't Do That.

Lenny (01:31:59):
I would read that. I love that title.

Richard Rumelt (01:32:02):
Can I tell you a story?

Lenny (01:32:03):
Absolutely.

Richard Rumelt (01:32:05):
My wife Kate took up skiing when we got married 24, 25 years ago, and she had this stance that she couldn't get rid of. When you make a turn, you don't turn like that, you put the ski out the step. I made her ski on one ski, I did all sorts of things to her back, she couldn't fix it. And finally we signed up with an illustrious ski teacher in Aspen, a three-day intense program, guaranteed that she would lose her stance, exceeded them all.

(01:32:45):
And so we went there... On the second day, I followed behind the instructor and her to see what was going on, and they had been through some exercises on day one, but in day two they were focusing on this and she would put out her ski like that and he'd yell at her. He'd say, "Don't do that," and after a day of being yelled at, "Don't do that," she didn't do it anymore, she was fixed. So, the secret technique that they had in this program for curing your stance was to yell at you telling you, "Don't do that." And so I'm thinking about a book called Don't Do That about business things where I'm not sure it makes sense, but you have to noodle these things for a while before they begin to gel.

Lenny (01:33:34):
I love this idea. It reminds me, one of my friends is a therapist, and there's this video by Bob Newhart where he's a therapist and someone comes to him and they've got all these problems like, "I get really sad when I think about my mom and I have this chronic pain," and his advice, "Just stop it, just stop."

Richard Rumelt (01:33:50):
Don't do that, just stop thinking about your mom.

Lenny (01:33:50):
"Just stop it," that's the advice. And so, I feel like there's a lot of synergy there. All right, well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Richard Rumelt (01:34:04):
I guess so.

Lenny (01:34:07):
First question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? I feel like this is going to be a challenging question, but what comes to mind?

Richard Rumelt (01:34:15):
It sort of is. The books that I'm... Clayton Christensen's stuff about The Innovator's Dilemma is always solid. Books on strategy that I recommend to other people on... There aren't that many. So, I like Playing to Win by Roger Martin. I really recommend other kinds of books, strategy books. It's easy to get a list of strategy books, but I think you should read biographies and histories. I think the book about Steve Jobs is brilliant. I like books about business leaders. I'd recommend Andy Grove's book Only the Paranoid Survive, and a few others, but I recommend that people read more broadly about people, Rockefeller's histories, it's fantastic.

(01:35:22):
The stuff about Rockefeller and how he put together... Rockefeller was a robber baron and he built an empire and all that, you learn that in school, but what you don't learn in school is he dropped the cost of a gallon of kerosene from $1 to 10 cents. That's the robber baron, and he made kerosene so inexpensive that he drove all the little mom and pop proprietors out of business, which is why they hated him. So, he was a vicious competitor, but he dropped the price of something by an order of magnitude, fascinating. So, it's important to understand stories, not just theories, but stories.

Lenny (01:36:22):
I love how this always comes back to just being steeped in history and this specific point about biographies is really interesting, and we'll link to all these books that you're mentioning in the show notes. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Richard Rumelt (01:36:36):
Oh yeah, sure. Well, I like Yellowstone, like everybody else. I'm fascinated by it. Recent movies other than Yellowstone? I'm not sure. We don't have a TV in the house right now, so I'm not connected.

Lenny (01:36:51):
That's amazing, that's the dream. I wish I could do that.

Richard Rumelt (01:36:57):
There will be a TV, but that room is being remodeled.

Lenny (01:37:02):
I see, just a matter of time. Is there a favorite interview question you'd like to ask people you interview, maybe specifically around helping you get a sense of are they good at strategic thinking?

Richard Rumelt (01:37:14):
I like to ask people about, what have you done that was hard that you're proud of? What have you done that was difficult? And what was it and why was it difficult and how did you get it done? I like to ask people about what they think was an interesting strategy from any time in the past they want to call out. Depending on the person's background, I might ask them about a particular company or situation, let's say, why do you think this worked or why didn't it work? So, I don't tend to ask questions about theory, I tend to ask questions about things that happened and part of me, I'm looking, does this person have any knowledge about the world or are they just know what the professor said last year. So, that kind of thing.

Lenny (01:38:28):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, whether it's an app, some you bought, some in the house, some on the road?

Richard Rumelt (01:38:36):
Well, we've got this new memory foam bed that we like, it's a pretty amazing innovation. I didn't think we'd like that, but we do. I really am fascinated by... I'm about to pull the trigger on buying one of these new smart telescopes.

Lenny (01:38:53):
Smart telescopes? I haven't heard of that. What makes them so smart?

Richard Rumelt (01:38:56):
It's a 12-inch reflected telescope, and it's too heavy to look around, it's too difficult to set up, but there are sort of new smart telescopes that run on a battery and you can put them outside. And the way they work is, first of all, they know where everything is in the sky, which has been around for a long time, but the new thing is, it's like astrophotography. They'll look at something for a minute, two minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, and form an image. You don't look through the telescope, you look at it on your phone or your computer, but you can see now the nebula that maybe the web telescope can see and you can see it now and you can see stuff out there that you couldn't before. And these are new things for $1,000 or $2,000 set that are remarkable in what they can do.

Lenny (01:39:56):
Excellent choice. Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, either in your work or in your life?

Richard Rumelt (01:40:05):
I used to have a final lecture I'd give to my MBA students about little pieces of wisdom, things not to do, things that offend people in other cultures. Don't do this if you're in Turkey, it means something else there. But I'd also say at some point your spouse or your partner will ask you, "Do you still love me?" And there's only one correct answer to that question, which is more than ever. And my wedding ring says that inside it, more than ever. So, I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but that's-

Lenny (01:40:57):
Absolutely.

Richard Rumelt (01:40:57):
... Getting a [inaudible 01:40:58] sense piece of wisdom.

Lenny (01:40:59):
That is really good advice, gave me tingles. I'm going to use that, 100%. Thank you for some marriage advice. Final question, your daughter Cassandra is a writer as well in fiction. She writes fiction. Is there anything that she taught you about writing that's helped you become a better writer?

Richard Rumelt (01:41:18):
Yeah, Cassandra is the... Oh my God, she's got like 25 books on the New York Times Bestseller list for teen fiction now. She started writing when she was 12 or 13. She had a talent for it. She's told me about the tension that you have to create and she writes novels and that it's not interesting unless there's... Well, we started talking about this when she was young, she was 14, and she asked me about, what is romance? I said, "Well, romance is a barrier. Romance is where there's a difficulty back to a couple, and there's some kind of..."

(01:42:12):
She said, "Oh, like he's rich and she's poor?" I said, "Yeah, like that." "Or he comes from the north side of town and she comes from the south." And I said, "Like that, yes." And she said, "Oh, like he's a vampire and she's not?" Okay, so she has alerted me and taught me about ways of creating that kind of tension in writing. It doesn't work as much in business writing as I'd like, but I try to create this sense of it's good strategy, bad strategy. It's a sense of there's a tension between the right way and a wrong way, or if not a right and wrong way, at least there's a tension between, should we go left or should we go right? It makes it interesting, otherwise it doesn't catch people's emotional court.

Lenny (01:43:14):
Amazing. Richard, thank you so much for being here. I think we're going to help a lot more people face bigger challenges and face them head-on and put together their action agendas and overcome this crux. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they ever want to try to reach out or learn more about the work you're doing these days? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Richard Rumelt (01:43:37):
I have a little website called thecruxbook.com that has information about me and about the books, so there. Don't write to me at UCLA. I don't pay attention to the UCLA website anymore, but if you go to thecruxbook.com, there's some email addresses where I can be reached. My little company's called General Imagination. It's like General Motors, but a lot smaller. It's just me, and you can reach me at richard@generalimagination.com. You can help me out... Oh, tell me stories. Tell me stories about your experiences, trying to create strategies, particularly inside organizations. How's it worked for you trying to get something done inside organizations? I'm happy to add more stories to my repertoire. Oh, and hire me.

Lenny (01:44:46):
Wait, say more on that. What is it that people would hire you for?

Richard Rumelt (01:44:51):
At this point in my life, I do public speaking. I speak on strategy and growth, and just got back from Korea doing it, I taught there. I do a little bit of teaching, not much. Maybe for the military people, if they want me to come in and do a day on strategy and I do foundries. A foundry is where you commit to a problem-oriented approach to strategy where the organizational leader, the CEO, usually plus another seven or eight people take two to three or four days off and we meet and we try to come up with, in the end, an action agenda and it's an interpersonal exercise.

(01:45:52):
I'm the facilitator. I don't tell them what to do, but I urge them to look more deeply and to understand what these problems actually are. It's interesting to do a foundry. You get quite focused on problems, as I do at the beginning. I'll often get 25, 50 problems up on the board or Post-It notes around, and when people look at that, they'll say, "I haven't ever done this before." When they see the 25 different problems or challenges, they realize you can't do them all. And so, they begin to get this sense of, "Oh geez, we better focus. We better focus on something. We better do something about some of these." And so, then we begin to go through this thing, "Well, which ones are really important and which ones are really addressable?" Well, sometimes we don't know if they're addressable or not. Oh, well, is there anybody in the organization who does know? Is there someone we could fly in here or have some perspective on this? So, we begin to try to identify the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed and what are we going to do about it? What are the coherent actions we're going to do to take these on? That's the exercise.

(01:47:16):
From time to time, after the foundries, they all say to me, "Well, where's the strategy? Where's the document with the mission, vision, all that?" No, that's not what we do. We're doing an action agenda and the foundry is time-consuming and a bit expensive to some extent, and most of the times we've had foundries, they really help the company gather its wits and its resources and do something, which I'm very pleased with how the foundries work. It's not so easy to figure out how to take the foundry concept and expand it. I've talked to a couple consulting firms about, "Well, the guys like learn how to do boundaries," and they say, "How does it work? It's one guy for three days? That's not what we do. We do 10 guys for three years." It's not a business model, but that's a nice symmetry for me because they're not going to compete with me.

Lenny (01:48:32):
I love that. I feel like you're about to get a flood of interest and requests. For everyone else, make sure to buy Richard's books, I got them right here, The Crux, Good Strategy Bad Strategy. Richard, again, thank you so much for being here.

Richard Rumelt (01:48:45):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
It feels like something has changed internally at Google. Just last week, Google Gemini hit the number one app in the App Store. I feel like nobody saw this coming.

Robby Stein (00:00:08):
Google's mission around have any information be universally accessible, this very enduring, very motivating thing, and it feels like with the AI moment, we can actually achieve that more than ever before. What I'm feeling now is just an incredible sense of focus and urgency. Things have hit a tipping point where these models are now truly able to deliver for consumers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
As ChatGPT emerged over the past couple of years, as Perplexity emerged, a lot of people were just like, "Google is dead. Nobody wants to sit through search results and click links."

Robby Stein (00:00:35):
The core Google search isn't really changing, in my opinion. We're not seeing that people come to search for just ridiculously wide set of things. They want a specific phone number, they want a price for something, they want to get directions. I think the vastness of that is underappreciated by many people. AI is expansionary. There's actually just more and more questions being asked and curiosity that can be fulfilled now with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
You've built a lot of very successful products. You used this phrase: embodying relentless improvement.

Robby Stein (00:00:59):
You need to be the physical manifestation of two pieces of things. One is just relentlessness, just complete effort that is always exerted in a direction of positive productivity. And then the second is make things better. You have to always make things better. You're never content.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
You build and launch Stories at Instagram back in the day is quite controversial because it basically took what Snapchat was doing really well and then like, "Hey, let's bring it to Instagram."

Robby Stein (00:01:21):
Not every great thing is going to be invented by you. Facebook probably created the modern feed, but there's a feed for every single product. At the end of the day, you're just robbing your user base of the opportunity to have a better product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today my guest is Robby Stein, Robby's VP of Product for Google Search and is responsible for essentially the entire Google search experience, including the new AI Overviews, AI Mode, multimodal AI experiences like Google Lens, the ranking algorithm, and a lot more. He's at the forefront of one of the biggest shifts in Google's history, and has already made a massive dent in Google's trajectory. He's also made a massive dent in the trajectory of Instagram where he was head of product, and led the launch of Instagram Stories and Reels and Close Friends, and through that, grew Instagram to half a billion daily active users. He's also on the founding team of Artifact with Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom. Started two companies of his own. Very few people have had this level of impact on two global consumer products at this scale. And Robby shares all of the biggest lessons that he's learned about building great and successful consumer products, along with a bunch of insights into where Google is headed in the world of AI.

(00:04:49):
Robby, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Robby Stein (00:04:53):
Thanks so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:54):
This is such a cool week to be recording this podcast. So just last week, Gemini, Google Gemini hit the number one app in the App Store. I have it right here, it's still number one in the App Store. It's above ChatGPT. I feel like nobody saw this coming. I feel like everyone's always like, "Google, what have you guys been doing? You guys build all this amazing tech and why didn't you have anything working in consumer? Why is ChatGPT doing? Why are all these amazing companies doing better than Google?"

(00:05:20):
So first of all, let me just say congrats on, I know this isn't all you. I imagine you had some part in this, so just congrats.

Robby Stein (00:05:26):
Many, many more people, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:28):
It feels like something has changed internally at Google. It feels like things are starting to really work, especially on the AI consumer side. So in terms of the growth, is Nano Banana the source of a lot of this recent growth or is there something else?

Robby Stein (00:05:40):
People are really excited about Nano Banana to be clear, very much so, but I think also people are recognizing that there's just so many cool things that you can do across the Google set of products and they've become quite powerful. I'm always shocked, even for things in search, people, we think they're very obvious. They sit right in the core search experience and then on X, I'll go look and like, "Oh, I just found out about this AI thing," and it seems very obvious, but I think a lot of people are just discovering quite how powerful these tools are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:07):
Now. So to go one level deeper, to your point, there's been all this incredible tech. You guys wrote the original transformers paper that have powered so much of the innovation and it's just like, "Where's Google been? And actually, why aren't they building the thing that's winning?"

(00:06:20):
What has changed? Is it just like, okay, has there been major reorgs? Has there been new leaders put in place? Is there just a new philosophy in the past couple of years that have led to this moment where Gemini is now the top app in the world?

Robby Stein (00:06:32):
Yeah, I mean, look, I've been to Google now, this is my second time at Google, so I started at Google in 2007, done a bunch of things in between, and I've been back at Google now, so I can't speak to that whole period for many, many years back to today. But what I can tell you about what I'm feeling now is just an incredible sense of focus and urgency to deliver great products quickly. I think that that is in part leadership for sure. I think the people who are, we work very closely with our partners at DeepMind and Google DeepMind. We work very closely obviously across the organization and there's just an incredible group of people and also an incredible group of researchers and technical thinkers who've been thinking about this for a while. When you have that energy, and I think the product teams and the tech, the research groups are working really closely together, we're able to move and we're getting a lot done.

(00:07:19):
I don't think there's any one thing that has happened. I think that a lot of times people ascribe a lot of momentum to a one time change or a single person. I find a lot of this is actually this compounding effect when you think about just every month ruthlessly improving the product or the models and just every day getting better, and then it just hits this tipping point where people just like it, they use it more, they enjoy it. And that's more of the feeling that I've had is just we've had, I think the right investment and focus and then it just hit a moment where people are seeing the effects of that now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:52):
As ChatGPT emerged over the past couple of years, as Perplexity emerged and all these other chatbots, a lot of people were just like, "Google is dead. Nobody wants to sit through search results and click links. Why not just get your answer right there?"

(00:08:06):
And it feels like that's not at all happening. It feels like you guys are doing just fine. What can you share about just the, I don't know, the state of Google search specifically, and then we'll talk about AI Mode. Just how is traffic going, how is search going considering all these things are out there, and just what are you seeing in the data since the launch of say ChatGPT?

Robby Stein (00:08:24):
Yeah. Well, what's interesting is people come to search for just ridiculously wide set of things, like all kinds of things. They want specific phone number, they want a price for something, they want to get directions, they want to find a payment web page for their taxes. Every possible thing you can imagine. I think the vastness of that is underappreciated by many people. And what we see is that it's not changing. AI hasn't really changed those foundational needs in many ways, and what we're finding is that AI is expansionary, and so there's actually just more and more questions being asked and curiosity that can be fulfilled now with AI. And so that's where you get the growth.

(00:09:00):
All the core Google search isn't really changing, in my opinion. We're not seeing that, but you're getting this expansion moment. What we're seeing is a few examples is you can now take a picture of something and ask about anything you see. And Google Lens, one of the fastest growing products out there, it's growing 70% year-over-year increase in visual searches, which is already at a massive scale. It's billions and billions and billions of searching in that way.

(00:09:24):
But you can take a picture of your shoes, say, "Where can I buy this?"

(00:09:27):
Or take a picture of your homework, say, "I'm stuck on question two."

(00:09:29):
And then just take a picture of your bookshelf and say, "What are the books I should get based on these books?" And AI can help you with those things now, just an example of I think why there's so much growth left and why we're so excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:41):
Okay, so you're not seeing the death of search.

Robby Stein (00:09:45):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:45):
And along the same lines, you guys recently launched AI Mode, which I don't think enough people are talking about. I think you get there at google.com/ai, is that the right URL?

Robby Stein (00:09:53):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):
Okay, cool. I've been playing with it as we were prepping for this conversation. It's really incredible. I asked it what is the best newsletter on product and growth and it's very smart. Said Lenny's Newsletter. So that's my eval.

Robby Stein (00:10:06):
Fantastic. Okay, one of one, perfect eval.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):
It's perfect. Also, just if you go to it, there's these recommendations for things to ask it that are just like, "Wait, how did you know I care about this stuff?" So it's like, "Help me switch to product management," just on the front page.

(00:10:21):
I'm like, "How did you know?" And it tells you that it's based on your Google activity. Talk about just what people should know about AI Mode, maybe what they don't really understand about the power of this thing.

Robby Stein (00:10:31):
I can tell you there's three big components to how we can think about AI search and the next generation of search experiences. One is obviously AI Overviews, which are the quick and fast AI you get at the top of the page many people have seen, and that's obviously been something growing very, very quickly. This is when you ask a natural question, you just put it into Google, you get this AI now, it's really helpful for people.

(00:10:51):
The second is around multimodal. This is visual search and lens. That's the other big piece. You go to the camera in the Google app and that's seeing a bunch of growth. And then really with AI Mode, it really brings it all together. It creates an end-to-end frontier search experience on state-of-the-art models to really truly let you ask anything of Google search. You can go back and forth, you can have a conversation and it taps into and is specially designed for search. What does that mean?

(00:11:16):
And one of the cool things that I think it does is it's able to understand all of this incredibly rich information that's within Google. There's 50 billion products in the Google shopping graph, for instance. They're updated 2 billion times an hour by merchants with live prices. You have 250 million places in maps. You have all of the finance information, and not to mention, you have the entire context of the web and how to connect to it so that you can get context but then go deeper. You put all of that into this brain that is effectively this way to talk to Google and get at this knowledge. And that's really what you can do now.

(00:11:52):
You can ask anything on your mind and it'll use all of this information to hopefully give you super high quality and informed information as best as we can, and you can use it directly at this google.com/ai. But it's also been integrated into our core experiences too. We announced you can get to it really easily if you can ask follow-up questions of AI Overviews right into AI Mode now. Same for the lens stuff. Take a picture takes you to AI Modes, you can have this back, you can ask follow-up questions and go there too. So it's increasingly integrated experience into the core part of the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
I imagine much of this is wait and see how people use it, but what's the vision of how all these things connect? Is the idea continue having this AI Mode on the side, AI Overviews at the top and then this multimodal experience, or is there a vision of somehow pushing these together even more over time?

Robby Stein (00:12:40):
I think there's an opportunity for these to come closer together. I think that's what AI Mode represents, at least for the core AI experiences, but I think of them is very complimentary to the core search product. You should be able to not have to think about where you're asking a question ultimately, you just go to Google. Today, if you put in whatever you want, we're actually starting to use much of the power behind AI Mode right in AI Overviews. So you can just ask really hard, you could put a five sentence question right into Google search. You can try it and then it should trigger AI at the top. It's a preview, and then you can go deeper into AI Mode and have this back and forth. So that's how these things connect.

(00:13:15):
Same for your camera. So if you take a picture of something, "What's this plant?" Or, "How do I buy these shoes?" It should take you to an AI little preview. And then if you go deeper, again, it's powered by AI Mode. You can have that back and forth, so you shouldn't have to think about that. It should feel like a consistent simple product experience ultimately, but obviously this is a new thing for us, and so we wanted to start it in a way that people could use and give us feedback with something like a direct entry point like google.com/ai.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:41):
I recently had Brian Balfour on the podcast and he showed this quote that's really stuck with me that I think about as you talk about all this, it was by Alex Rampell, this idea that startups is a game of getting distribution before incumbents can innovate fast enough.

(00:13:55):
And it feels like you guys are finally there where it's like, "Oh man, now here comes Google." I don't know if I have a question here, but it just feels like there's been all this time for people to find distribution, and now it's like, okay, now Google is coming.

Robby Stein (00:14:07):
What we found is that people are asking these questions in Google. They're trying to get this out of Google. And so if you can just have an AI that's powerful enough to answer a really hard calculation someone's trying to figure out, or take a picture of multiple choice homework question for a chemistry question, people are doing this. And so now that you have this really sophisticated AI that's based on our frontier models, we can just handle increasingly more and more stuff for people and so hopefully that's the more natural on ramp here. And then we just need to make it easy enough for people to use, because these are new products, and people are used to using Google in a specific way.

(00:14:38):
They type in keywords, we call it sometimes keyword ease, but you can actually use natural language in Google. That's the biggest shift. We're seeing people asking real long, hard, complex questions. You just don't think, "Oh, I can go to Google and type in what's a great place for a date night? I already went to these four restaurants. I'm looking for outdoor dining and my friend has this allergy." You could put that into Google. And I think that's the kind of thing that we're excited to continue to make easy for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:03):
It's interesting, and we've come around to back in the day there was Ask Jeeves, which was this whole just ask a question as if you're asking a human and then it'll give you a really good answer.

(00:15:12):
And then we moved into Google just, "No, no, just type the thing you want and figure out how Google likes it."

(00:15:17):
And now we're back to, "Okay, just ask your question and it'll give you a really good answer."

Robby Stein (00:15:20):
Yeah, Ask Jeeves was surprisingly prescient on that, huh? They had material, they had something way before its time that we think looks to rally around now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
Oh, man. What's your take on this whole rise of AEO, GEO, which is this evolution of SEO? I'm guessing your answer is going to be just create awesome stuff and don't worry about it, but there's a whole skill of getting to show up in these answers. Thoughts on what people should be thinking about here?

Robby Stein (00:15:47):
Sure. I mean, I can give you a little bit of under the hood how this stuff works because I do think that helps people understand what to do, but when our AI constructs a response, it's actually trying to, it does something called query fan-out where the model uses Google search as a tool to find to do other querying. Maybe you're asking about specific shoes, it'll add up and append all of these other queries like maybe dozens of queries and start searching basically in the background. And it'll make requests to our data back end, so if it needs real time information, it'll go do that. And so at the end of the day, actually something searching, it's not a person, but there's searches happening and then each search is paired with content. And so if for a given search your web page is designed to be extremely helpful and you can look up Google's human rater guidelines and read, it's a very long document that's been thoughtfully crafted for decades now around what makes great information.

(00:16:40):
This is something Google has studied more than anyone, and it's like, do you satisfy the user intent, what they're trying to get? Do you have sources? Do you cite your information? Is it original or is it repeating things that have been repeated 500 times? And there's these best practices that I think still do largely apply because it's going to ultimately come down to an AI is doing research and finding information. And a lot of the core signals, is this a good piece of information for the question? They're still valid, they're still extremely valid and extremely useful, and that will produce a response where you're more likely to show up in those experiences now.

(00:17:14):
I think the only thing I would give advice to would be think about what people are using AI for. I mentioned this as an expansionary moment. It seems to be that people are asking a lot more questions now, particularly around things like advice, or how to, or more complex needs versus maybe more simple things. And so if I were a creator, I would be thinking, what kind of content is someone using AI for? And then how could my content be the best for that given set of needs now? And I think that's a really tangible way of thinking about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
It's interesting your point about how it goes in searches. When you use it, it's searching a thousand pages or something like that. Is that just a different core mechanic to how other popular chatbots work because the others don't go search a bunch of websites as you're asking?

Robby Stein (00:18:00):
Yeah. This is something that we've done uniquely for our AI. It obviously has the ability to use parametric memory and thinking and reasoning and all the things a model does, but one of the things that makes it unique for designing it specifically for informational tasks, we wanted to be the best at informational needs, that's what's Google's all about, and so how does it find information? How does it know if information is right? How does it check its work? These are all things that we built into the model, and so there is a unique access to Google. Obviously, it's part of Google search, so it's Google search signals everything from spam, what's content that could be spam? And we don't want to probably use in a response all the way to, wow, this is the most authoritative helpful piece of information. We're going to link to it and we're going to explain, hey, according to this website, check out that information and then you're going to go probably go see that yourself. That's how we've thought about designing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:51):
You've worked on a lot of AI products at this point, and it's not just Google or Artifact and Instagram, you did a lot of AI stuff. What's something you've learned about building AI products that you find maybe people don't truly understand, maybe something that's surprised you by building successful AI products?

Robby Stein (00:19:07):
I think the most recent one, and this is true, something even within the last week or two, is that it's so obvious how human-like the interface is becoming with how you can communicate and steer AI. I think it used to be even just months back that you had to do a lot of work to get the AI to do the thing you're trying to get it to do, right? You had to do these incantations, you had to prompt in a really specific way. People would have all these hacks like, "Hey, act like you're a coach and you do these things," and you have to really push it, or to use a tool more on the technical side. You had to do post-training, you had to take this foundational model and you had to show it data, you had to train it and actually update its weights to do more sophisticated things.

(00:19:51):
Tell it, "Hey, here's documentation for an API. If you ever have a problem, ping this API. Here's the data," as if it's an engineer that you had that you could talk to and it would have no idea what to do with that, or it would have some idea and wouldn't really do it.

(00:20:05):
But increasingly, you can just use language. Almost if you were to write up an order, you could be like, "Wow, I'm a new startup. Here's my data internally. Here are the APIs to it. Here's the schema and the URL. Here's when to use it. By the way, make sure that if you get this kind of a question, you really make sure to get it right." And that'll end up doing a lot in the model.

(00:20:28):
The model's been now encoded to be able to say, "Okay, I'm going to use more reasoning or thinking budget for that kind of a question."

(00:20:35):
Or, "I'm going to use tools or code, use code execution in order to connect to this API I'm told about." That's a relatively new thing. So I think it's going to open up a lot of this democratization of accessing these models and building incredible things because you don't even need to do a lot. To get the most sophisticated outcomes increasingly, I don't think you need to do a lot of this heavy duty fine-tuning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:58):
It makes me think about, I had this recent guest, Nesrine Changuel, on the podcast. She was a PM at Google, she worked on Google Meet, she was a delight PM working on at making products more delightful. And she talked about the reason Google Meet did so well and is now feels like it's killing Zoom is they compared the experience of Google meet to a human meeting versus making it the best possible video conference, make this as good as a human experience. And that's interesting what you're talking about, how that's almost the goal here with AI is just make you feel like you're just talking to a person.

Robby Stein (00:21:27):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:28):
Might be obvious, but think about that. Okay, let me zoom out and talk about, and let's talk about just broader lessons you've learned over the course of your career. You've built a lot of very successful products, which I've shared in the intro at this point.

Robby Stein (00:21:44):
Many also on the other side of the spectrum, we got the whole portfolio.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
Okay, perfect. We'll talk about some of that. I asked you as we were getting ready for this conversation, what's one thing you wanted to get across in this conversation? What's something you think would be really helpful for product builders to hear to help them build more successful products? And you used this phrase: embodying relentless improvement. Can you just talk about that? What does that mean? Why is this so important?

Robby Stein (00:22:08):
Of course, I mean, I think that you need to be the physical manifestation of two pieces of things. One is just relentlessness, just complete effort, but is always exerted in a direction of positive productivity. And then the second is make things better. You have to always make things better, you're never content. And I think this actually came out of a story, a little bit of a funny story where I was at Instagram at the time doing a big all team meeting, one of my first, and they had this icebreaker, what's one word to describe yourself?

(00:22:35):
And so in the backstage area, I texted my wife really quick. I was like, "Hey, just one word to describe me, first thing that comes to your mind."

(00:22:42):
And she just wrote back, "Dissatisfied."

(00:22:45):
I was chuckling in the back room because I was first of all kind of offended because I was like, "It's not loving, caring, something good?" And then I saw her little bubble thing.

(00:22:56):
She's like, "Okay, there's more." And then she wrote me this really thoughtful thing that was like, "It's not that you're just unhappy. It's like you want the world to be better. You're driven out of a deep desire. It's that you feel this sense of dissatisfaction with what the world gives you. You want to make it better, and you're pushed and motivated to do that."

(00:23:17):
And I thought about that after. And it wasn't until we built a bunch of products, some that didn't do well, some that have had a lot of really large success now, billions of people use them, where it felt like one of the big differences, obviously a lot of it is just the conditions of the product and a little bit of luck here and there too. But for the things that went well, there was always this spirit of just we're going to get it eventually if we just make two more moves to make it better. And then eventually, as I talked about before earlier in our conversation, you get this tipping point where it just tips over into being net useful to people because of just that amount of compounding effort that you put into something because you're just always so... You're the harshest critic and the most dissatisfied person in the room about your own work basically.

(00:23:56):
And I think that's really meaningful. And there's this other incredible story that Tony Fadell told on a TED Talk 10 years ago. You can look it up. I think it's something around Think Younger as a title. And he talks about what it means that as we grow up in age and become grownups, I have two little kids so that's something I think about a lot. We habituate to everything. We accept and we tolerate what the world gives us everywhere, and we just go, "Oh, that kind of sucks. Oh, well," we shrug our shoulders and we move on.

(00:24:27):
But if you don't do that and you ask, "Why? This sucks, why am I tolerating this and how do I make it better?" He has this incredible story about going grocery shopping, and he goes on for 10 minutes about this story almost it felt like where he talks about getting a piece of fruit like a plum or a peach, and how it has that sticker on it and it's got that sticker and who put that sticker there?

(00:24:51):
And then when you get home, you take your fruit out of your bag, you're ready to eat it, you're all excited, you stick your thumb under the sticker, it punctures the flesh. He goes into just incredible detail about how it punctures the flesh of the fruit. The sticker comes off now, the fruit's bleeding, then you flick the sticker. The sticker misses the garbage, you bend over and pick it up, you put the sticker back in.

(00:25:17):
And I was like, "Wow, that is embodying this mentality of just why is this here? How can this be better?" And I think the best product people, the best thinkers in the space, that's how they think, in my opinion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
I imagine there are many examples of you doing this in the many products you worked on. Is there one that comes to mind as a good example of this inaction of this actually working really well and delivering something really huge?

Robby Stein (00:25:44):
I mean, honestly, a big thing is working on AI Mode. I think a lot of it was we saw in AI Overviews that people were trying to ask harder questions and we weren't able to answer a bunch of them, or AI Overviews just didn't show up. And so a bunch of us sat around and we're like, "Why can't you just do this for everything?"

(00:26:04):
Instead of saying, "Oh, we don't need to solve for that," or, "That's not something that's in the most addressable next thing."

(00:26:12):
It's like we actually saw people in the query stream putting the words AI at the end of their queries because they're trying to get the AI to do the thing. We would look at that and be like, "This is ridiculous. We need to build something here."

(00:26:27):
And that was one of the big motivations, was actually identifying that user problem, being very disgruntled on behalf of the user. We're just failing the user every day. We are not helping them actually get their thing better understood, and we're going to go build a whole thing because of it, because that's hard to do by the way, to build all of that. But it just was so obvious that that's what we needed to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:52):
There's two buckets of people. Let's say hypothetically, one bucket is just make things better, make amazing experiences, you're going to do great. There's another bucket that's like drive metrics, drive goals, hit our KPIs. I know what you're not saying is just work on things, just make things better, relentlessly, make things better. How do you just think about, I guess that overlap of okay, makes things better, but also here's what we really, here's the strategy, here's the vision. How do you think?

Robby Stein (00:27:18):
Yeah, I don't think of them as an or. I think they have to be intersected because basically the way I think about it is you actually start with a problem or the inverse of that, which is a vision, but they're connected. Most great companies, most great products come out of a problem, but out of the problem becomes like, "Here's a better way." What if instead of this crappy thing or way of living or thing that we all tolerate and accept, some entrepreneur comes up and says, "What if we did this other thing?" So it comes out of this dissatisfaction and this sense of better that you need to make things better, but then you're going to build, and at the end of the day, you need your instrumentation to know if you're on the right track.

(00:27:58):
And that's where you bring tools like, okay, you build your first version of the product, do people like it? And then each product goes through its journey. The way understand that people like it is you scrutinize. Typically, you talk to people, but you also add some analytical tools there. You might look at something like a J-curve. This is the retention, the percentage of people still using the product day seven, day 30, day 90, and does it flatten or do people just drip out of there? Over time, it's just not exciting people. And that would go to zero if on a long enough timeline, no one's going to use it. You don't get past that, you toast right then. Okay, some people are doing it, okay, great. We need more people to do it, and it needs to be good enough that people talk about it and then it grows. And so that's another gate.

(00:28:44):
And then there's another one which is, well, how big can this get actually, is it a small thing? Is it a medium thing? And I think most companies, you have an aspiration of being big, but you can't start big. Everyone's got to go through that journey. No product has started big. Even ones that get big really quickly, even a week quickly, they had something. And then even internally, they started small. They started small with a hundred to 100 people, and so you have to be metrics focused, I think in order to know if you're doing the right thing.

(00:29:09):
And then the other thing is, on the other side of the spectrum, you're running a big thing, and there, you need metrics to be your guide. If your product, let's say, let's say our core metrics down 5% this week, it's like, well, what's going on? And so you be really close to root cause analysis there and say, "Well, actually it turns out that it's an issue. Is it in a region? Is it on a device? Is it in a demographic? Is it in a use case? Where does my problem lie?"

(00:29:33):
And then when you get to it, you understand the problem and then this improvement thing comes back where it's like, "Okay, I'm going to fix that thing. What's the treatment for that disease?" And then you're back to growth again, and so you need this and you always are looking at what's the system that I'm working on and what are my instruments? I'm a pilot to know if this thing is going and flying correctly, but then it doesn't tell you exactly what to do, you have to thank for yourself how to make it better. I can just show you a little bit of the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I love that you just gave a master class on just how to prioritize and pick what to work on. I want to go on a quick tangent. Speaking of products that have done really well and become really big, Stories, you build and launched Stories at Instagram. It's quite an infamous product launch back in the day, it was quite controversial because it basically took what Snapchat was doing really well and then, "Hey, let's bring it to Instagram," and it was not great for Snapchat. Now that it was so long ago and just, it's so far in the past, I'm so curious just to hear about that time reflecting on just that decision, what you guys talked about, how you decided to go ahead with that and anything just, I don't know, you think about looking back at that.

Robby Stein (00:30:47):
I think there's a couple of really important lessons from that launch. And I mean we went on afterwards to launch Reels, a bunch of updates to direct messaging, we had feed rank game. There was just a huge era there when I was there between 2016 and 2021 or so where just so many new products got built. I think an interesting lesson in all of those, and particularly in Stories was you have to really understand why someone uses your product and know when something is actually an existential question because there's just a better format or a different way of doing something that has worked and works and you need to figure out what that might mean for you, because not every great thing is going to be invented by you. But I think that a lot of these things are, they can become formats that you can make your own and you need to learn from the world and what's happening out there in order for your product to always give the best thing to its users.

(00:31:41):
And so for Stories, we looked at Instagram like, what's the point of Instagram? It is sharing your life and connecting with people ultimately. And if there's a way to do that, that lowers the pressure because it doesn't have likes or it's just ephemeral format and it's optimized well for mobile because it's this full screen experience. It's a really great format and kudos to Snapchat for inventing it. We didn't think of that as a deterrent, that we had to go make Instagram photo clock. And actually, there were early versions of this idea where you try to take the core Instagram feed and make it ephemeral. And whenever you try to mix a core product that's very cemented in someone's mind and physically looks a specific way and you're trying to make, contort it to do something new, it's usually a bad recipe. And so we knew we needed to do something new and then it was so clearly was critical to the core essence of what the product could do, could fit in naturally.

(00:32:39):
But the question was how do we make it our own? And how do we build on this? And so if you think, there were a bunch of things that we did that made it Instagram. For example, it had different creative tools and it had things like neon drawing and these really sophisticated filters that people loved. We also looked at this talk about being dissatisfied. People took, a lot of times they want their main camera to take a picture of something and then they want to upload it to Instagram because they want to save it and they want it to be in a very high quality, high resolution photo, because it's a memory. And Snapchat at the time didn't allow you to upload photos, it was like you have to use the Snap camera. And so we made a bunch of decisions like that where why don't you just let people upload their photo? This is back to the dissatisfied point, that's frustrating.

(00:33:22):
Or there's another example where you couldn't pause if you were consuming a story. You couldn't pause it, it just would go through and be done because it was this ephemeral thing and you wanted to create safety. Why can't you just pause? It goes by too fast. So we added this pause, it's such a small thing, but you put your finger down to pause the story now. And so there were a whole set of those things that were shipped that made Stories feel Instagram. It wasn't like you just had some other thing. And then it turns out that worked incredibly well, and so much to the fact that someone on the team mentioned that they always felt like at the time, they didn't realize it, but it was almost like it was missing the story size holes at the top of the page and it completed the product in some weird way for them. And so that was, I think an important lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:05):
Instagram definitely got a lot of hate for that moment from a lot of founders. It was just like, "Hey, you guys just stole this idea and that sucks."

(00:34:13):
How did you guys just deal with that internally? It was just this is, "We got to do this. We got to focus on our shareholders and grow this thing," and that's how it goes sometimes?

Robby Stein (00:34:19):
I mean, I think it's more that we're focused on our users and the people who are loving Instagram and it's denying them the opportunity to have an easy way to just share a photo and have the thing go away. I mean, that's ultimately what we were trying to add. At the end of the day, that is a format that people adopt. In the same way that you think about feeds, I think we talked about this at the time too when we shipped it. Facebook probably created the modern feed, but there's a feed for every single product. There's a LinkedIn feed and there's a feed for DoorDash.

(00:34:53):
These things become core primitives quickly and formats, and then at the end of the day, you're just robbing your user base of the opportunity to have a better product if you're not making the best possible product for your use cases. And for Instagram, it's used differently. People use Instagram differently than they use other products. And it turns out that there were these experiences in WhatsApp and in Messenger and in many other social products over time, and they all were used differently actually, which is fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
Something else I want to talk about is you came into two products that were already doing really well, Instagram and Google. And on the Instagram side, a transformative growth and improvement. Google is happening, we're in the middle of the improvement and growth you're driving. Not a lot of people get to do this where they go into an existing product, make it grow significantly. A lot of people want to do this. They have a product that's been around for a long time. Hey, how do we make this grow and be more successful? Is there anything specifically that you've learned about just coming into an existing product, figuring out where the big opportunities are and then just hockey-sticking growth? Because this is what everyone wants to do.

Robby Stein (00:35:57):
There's a couple lessons here. And I think, by the way, the first lesson is to be humble always because it's extremely incredible to be able to work on products that have such impact on people. I view product like golf, you're always one stroke away from shanking. And as soon as you think you're good, you're not, you don't know anything. The world changes quickly. You have to always be a servant to your user base and the people that are out there and learn from them. The first thing I always do and think about is you get in touch in terms of why are people using this product, and where are the areas of growth? And so usually even in a big product or a mature in a complex system, there's a part of it that's growing. There's a part of it that's mature, there could be a part of it that's declining or isn't growing as much.

(00:36:42):
Certainly in Instagram, there's been a big shift over the years of sharing into public very large broadcast posts and feed into these more lightweight formats like Stories and DM actually private sharing as well. And so you have to observe that because every month, every year, the world changes, people's needs change. First thing you do is you get a sense of what do people want out of this product? What's its true essence? I think a lot about this job to be done framework, which is one of the things that I'm a big fan of and Clayton Christensen's book on Competing Against Luck is one of my favorite books on this topic where you have to really be a student of causation. Why is someone using this product? What are they doing with it and what are they trying to get done with it?

(00:37:26):
And that usually leads you to do bigger next stage ideas, and it removes this belief that you need to solve the problem with the current tools. In the Instagram version, it was like you have to make a square photo do more for people. That would be how you increment the product. Or in Google's example, there's something very specific with the core search experience that needs to change, it's a subtle tweak. You have to think, well, what's the big thing? Someone's trying to ask a really hard question out of Google? What's the best way to do that for them? And so it makes you think more first principled and that's the first basis of this.

(00:38:04):
And then once from first principles, you're like, "Oh, this newer thing." And it could be a shift, it could be a new form. In many ways, the AI version of Google and Stories and Reels, they're all similar in that they're new formats in the world that people are expecting and wanting more of.

(00:38:18):
And by adding them, it becomes complementary, not replacement. And in both cases, Stories didn't replace Instagram, it expanded in the same way we're seeing for AI. And so what's interesting is then you think, well, how do I bring that into my world? You have this big mature product. The best way I've seen is by making it complimentary, having it be a core part of the experience, but clearly defined as a distinctive thing that has its own attributes associated with it because people think spatially. So if you have a feed and you have holes with pictures, they expect those holes to do things. And so if you make one of those holes with a little clock and that one goes away the next day or you can't like it or it operates differently than the other parts of your feed, it's going to be super confusing for people. It sucks.

(00:38:59):
And so you have to add product carefully, but it needs to feel coherent but different. Stories, it has similar aesthetic. It obviously uses your camera roll in the same way it works that you can share it in DM, it works in the system, but it has a different primitive in the same way Google AI, it's a full page experience that you can pop out now. You can have follow up conversation with it. People have a set of expectations you need to snap to for those use cases. And then you are constantly learning how to best make these new products work within your world.

(00:39:31):
You never just want to snap in something that's working, you have to make it work for your users, your expectations, and what people are trying to do with your product. It's actually one of the things I see people fail on the most is they assume something working for one system will work in your world, but someone else's system is on totally the types of users they have with the consumer expectation of that product, that's totally different set of expectations. You have to respect that and say, "What can we learn from that," and bring it here. I guess if you were to talk about the method that I've seen now or twice, I guess that's how these products have developed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:09):
I love this topic. It makes me think about just this balance. People always try to find between optimizing something they've already got versus trying to take a big bet on something. You've had so many examples where you've taken a big bet on something totally new and it's worked out incredibly well. Do you have just a heuristic in how you structure teams and prioritize across, okay, we have amazing Google experience today, what percentage of resources go into improving that versus trying something totally new?

Robby Stein (00:40:35):
That's one where I actually do feel like the more analytical, systematic thinking helps a lot because you're trying to produce value in the world, you want to quantify it some way. And so if you're seeing this growth curve and you're trying to understand, wow, people are using it more and more to liken this product. And when products are young, they grow, and then eventually things mature. You can break out product suites and different features of products all along the same way. Certain features that are growing fast, other features that are not. You get to these points of just diminishing marginal return in every system where it feels like you could put 50 people on this project, it's just not going to dramatically move the needle. Part of it is this bottoms up thing with your own team being really thoughtful about what is the expected value of that investment, and knowing when it's starting to approach zero or diminishing marginal return.

(00:41:23):
And then when that happens, these are these moments that usually coincide with something fundamental changing. Either people's expectations, externally, market saturation, there's something happening where you need to adjust. You then find your next growth driver or set of drivers. That's where you need to go more first principled and try these new things more. Then when you land a new thing that creates this new little growth engine and then you put people on it and you optimize it because each change is like 10% win, 20% win, 4% win.

(00:41:57):
It's clearly still has so much value in headroom and to make it better for people, and you can see that in the data. And so that becoming, I talked about this instrumentation, it becomes your guide for knowing if you're making good calls. Otherwise, if you don't know where you're headed and you don't have a goal of what you're trying to do more quantitatively, it's really hard to know if the thing you're doing is mattering to anyone. I think I made the product better, but is anyone using it? Does anyone care? Or are we just congratulating ourselves? Ultimately you want to have impact on people and that's what matters.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:29):
So it says essentially tracking S-curves on every product and understanding if you're in the plateau and if it's time to invest heavily somewhere else.

Robby Stein (00:42:36):
Yes.

(00:43:39):
Maybe it would be helpful to talk about the journey of AI Mode, just how it emerged and the steps that you took to now it's just such a big part of the Google search experience. When did this start? How did you decide this is worth betting on? And then what are the steps to get it further and further rolled out?

Robby Stein (00:43:55):
I mean, I think it probably started earlier on with AI Overviews actually, which was the first way we brought generative AI to search. And in that world, we noticed that people were asking these questions and many people were actually trying to put natural language questions into search. And so how can you provide helpful context links to go deeper and make an AI that made sense for Google? That was our first version of these models that could do this for people. And then by building into that and seeing this observation around people wanting more of it, direct access to it, and then being able to ask follow-up questions. You need a new modality. It's going to be really hard to build all of that within the construct of the core search experience. And so that led us to have form a small team of folks, a few people that were technical leaders, a couple designers very small to just prove out what if there was on, almost blank screen, delete, make a little fresh doc with a blinker.

(00:44:53):
What if there's a new page and you can ask the question, you can ask whatever you want of it. You can tap right into the AI that was originally powering this top of the experience in search. But we invested in making it much more powerful in the ways I described before was in it could search for you. It had reasoning as a part of its model capability, it had multi turn context, so if you had a conversation with it could keep track of that context so it had some unique pieces to it. And what would happen if we tried that quickly. And we basically got, I mean, this was probably five to 10 people worth of people originally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:29):
And how long ago was this team formed?

Robby Stein (00:45:31):
This was probably over the last year, last summer basically, into the fall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:34):
Wow, so about a year ago.

Robby Stein (00:45:37):
Yeah, maybe about a year ago. It was where maybe it started. We were really plugging away on it, and then we saw this little version of it emerge that wasn't very good, but it had this moments of brilliance. It's actually, again, it's kind of like golf where you hit the perfect shot and you're like, "Oh my God." You get that feeling where it's just everything worked. And I asked it a question about, I forget, I was doing something with my daughter and I was planning an experience and it found all this incredibly useful information about park information. It had links to go to the site and confirm a bunch of things. It had Google Maps information that for my daughter, you could walk up, it was walkable. There was early examples like this where it just, it blew me away of what it could find and how helpful it was.

(00:46:27):
It gave us conviction that we should go and go further. And obviously there's lots of people involved in this type of a decision, tons of support from leaders across the organization. But it just says a little working team that initially, you got to build something and then you have to feel it yourself and it is very entrepreneurial in that way. And then when you see it tangibly, you're like, "What's a version of that? That's good and that could work?" And that gave you hope. And so then we basically built it out and built the first version that launched in Labs basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:01):
So the first big milestone was this is working. It was just a qualitative experience of, "Oh wow, this has really, there's magic here."

Robby Stein (00:47:09):
Yes, it's working. And then we did bring it before labs actually to trusted tester group. There were maybe 500 people externally that we added onto it, and we had pings with them. Some of them were, we actually had friends and family. We tried to treat it a little more like a startup where, because we feel like you got to have people test it to tell you the truth, and tell you when it sucks, because it probably does.

(00:47:27):
And then they'd message you. So I had a friend who was loving it, but also hating it for lots of good reasons and would just be messaging me all the time, screenshots, "This broke, this broke, this makes no sense."

(00:47:37):
We had that for a while, and then we got to a point where it was feeling good, the trusted testers were liking it, reporting good stuff, and then we it to this Labs moment where anyone could turn it on and then we used that to make it better with real query data. We could actually see what people were using it for at more scale and so that could tune it to make it better. And then we launched it out to everyone, or at least in the US, and then we've now been on this journey to expand it to all countries and languages and have more people be able to access it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:05):
It's incredible that Google went roughly in a year from idea to a significant change to the search experience that's AI powered. I think this is not what people imagine Google is like, and it feels like things are different and things have changed in how you guys operate. What has allowed this to happen so quickly? What's changed? Is it just top-down leadership, we need to get shit done, or is there something more?

Robby Stein (00:48:30):
No, I mean I think it's interesting how organizations change. I think when you feel like there is a moment in time that is clearly critical to deliver for people, people are trying to get information from Google. We are not able to answer certain things or help people in certain ways and there's this technology that can do it, that creates urgency, and obviously there's lots of people building lots of things and the market's crazy and there's lots of things shipping all the time.

(00:48:56):
There's a really exciting and healthy moment for us to build and build quickly and I think it's just exciting to be able to capture that opportunity because I think people believe, and I certainly believe that the next year or so of product is going to establish how people use the next wave of products for many years. And so at least I can only speak for myself, I feel this obligation to our users to give them the best version of Google that's powered by AI and that gives them the full knowledge of everything Google knows about the world and information to people and accessible with AI. That's driving a lot of the excitement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:34):
Yeah, it's such a good point that people are building their new habits. It's wild how many people just now rely on ChatGPT and how quickly that happened. And I could see Google being worried that, oh, shit, everyone's changing their habit from searching Google to searching ChatGPT. And the fact that now Gemini is number one. I was actually looking at the list of top, so in the top 15 apps, Google is I think five of them, a third. It's out of control, killing it. When people look at AI Mode versus ChatGPT or Claude or let's even say Perplexity, what's the way you think about the positioning of AI Mode versus these other tools? Is it trying to be a direct competitor or is it just like, "No, it's actually pretty different and here's what it's for?"

Robby Stein (00:50:15):
Yeah, I mean AI Mode's a way to ask search anything you want. It's designed and specially created for information. And so really, it should give incredible helpful responses for the things that people come to Google for. Think about you're planning a trip, you're trying to buy something, you're working through a question for your research project. It needs information and that's really, it's less focused on things like creativity, although there's things that can do that are nice there. It can help you. Just like any kind of core AI product, you can ask it to rewrite something for you, it'll do that. But we are less focused on creativity, productivity, upload a spreadsheet and output graphs for me, we're not focused on that.

(00:50:57):
We're really focused on what people use Google for, and making an AI for that so that you can come to Google, ask whatever you want and get effortless information about that and context and links to then also verify, dig in and go to the authoritative sources ultimately that people want, and we hear from people. So those ends up becoming the distinct qualities of this product versus more of a chatbot. Maybe you would talk to it like you maybe even have a bit of a, "Hey, how are you doing today," with that chatbot that we have some of that, we see that a little bit, but people are usually coming for information. They're trying to learn something and we focused our product on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:30):
Got it. Okay, AI Mode is not your therapist. Maybe zooming out again a little bit and reflecting on all the amazing products you've worked on, all the places you've worked, if you had to pick two or three just core product principles or philosophies that have helped you build such amazing and successful products, what would those be? What comes to mind?

Robby Stein (00:51:53):
I mean, there's typically three things I think about. If I were to write a book about how to build great products, there'd be three chapters. I mean there'd probably more than that, but three chapters.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:08):
I love that. I love how short that would be. That's the ideal book.

Robby Stein (00:52:08):
I've thought about these three areas now for a while and it's like they're always consistently the three things. The first is deeply understand people, and I think we talked about this a little bit with the jobs to be done point and Clayton Christensen's book, which I loved around Competing Against Luck. It really helps you be a student of why someone ends up, in his words, hiring a product. Don't think of users as using your product. Think of users as hiring you to do something for them.

(00:52:35):
There's this famous quote, I think it's Theodore Levitt had, "People don't want a quarter inch drill, they want a quarter inch hole." So what is someone trying to do? You have to understand that deeply and then you can build an amazing product. And also by the way, when you go back, why someone not using your product?

(00:52:57):
And so it focuses on these techniques to extract causation. So he actually talks a lot about this interview. He calls it an interrogation where you talk to a user like, "Hey, why do you use my product? Where were you? Were you in bed? Were you at work? What were you doing?"

(00:53:11):
"Oh, I was talking to my wife in the morning."

(00:53:13):
"Okay, well, what brought it up?"

(00:53:15):
"Well, I guess I was reading the newspaper."

(00:53:16):
"Okay, well why?"

(00:53:17):
And then you have this aha moment like that when they first decide to use your product, he calls it the big hire. That is information that you obtain ends up becoming the most critical because that is what caused someone to use your product. And if you can study that and understand it, you'll be much more on your way than just building things that sound cool. And so that's the first chapter is deeply understand people.

(00:53:37):
Second is really around analytical rigor and understanding your problems. You have to understand your problems. And this got is a little bit of what we were talking about about root cause analysis and understanding, okay, the metrics are dropping. Why? If someone's not using your product, why? And really being able to dissect that to get to true root causes. It's like, well, they went all the way to the end and then bailed, and then you understand what turns out that it was most, we actually learned about this and there's a story in Close Friends at Instagram where it just totally failed at first in a bunch just when we shipped it. And it turned out that we looked at the data and people were only adding one close friend to their list because it was mistranslated as best friend in many markets. So people just put one person and then the probability that person saw it and wrote back to you was zero. It's a product which is broken. So it's like you got to understand your problems.

(00:54:30):
And then the third one's around really designing for clarity instead of cleverness. A lot of people are like, "Oh, we're going to differentiate the design," and we talked about this a little bit with Stories. We're going to make a new version of something, but if something's a standard and people understand it, if you lean into it, you're going to get so much leverage than if you reinvent it, and you have to be really thoughtful around when you reinvent and where you don't.

(00:54:54):
And I think on this one, there's this great, Don Norman's book. Obviously, Design of Everyday Things is a big one, but he has this incredible chapter in there about doors, and why is it that after all of these years you walk up to a door, and based on how they're designed at times, people still don't know if you should pull or push that door because if you try to build the as beautiful symmetric two handles on each side on a glass door, it doesn't communicate in for any information to you.

(00:55:20):
And there's lots of, I've seen all the time we've designed new icons when we could have used global icons like, "Oh, wouldn't it be so cool if we used a camera that's kind of a camera but is mostly an AI looking thing and then is mostly, but then has this dots in it that connects it to this other product?"

(00:55:37):
And you're like, people just, it's a camera. Just put the camera in. Maybe you could add a little thing to it, and that's how you get people to use your products. And if you do those three things, I think you typically can do well.

(00:55:49):
And then, sorry, the fourth one would be more of the coda is be humble. Constantly and always question yourself. Listen to others, listen to users and be open to being wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:00):
I love these. On that third point, I feel like AI Mode as the name is such a good example of clarity. What is this? This is AI Mode.

Robby Stein (00:56:07):
We talked about it internally. If you look at it in the tab, it's like everyone know, it's like you see it and you'll know what it is or we could call it something random, but then what is that? And now you're working against yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
If I were to reflect back these three pieces of basically this is the book you would write to help people build more successful products, it's understand the problem you're solving for people deeply. What's the job they're hiring you to do? I love the, it's lowercase jobs to be done. It's not like the rigorous whole thing that everyone-

Robby Stein (00:56:41):
Exactly. Lowercase for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:41):
Okay. This is just like why are people hiring your product to solve a problem for them? What problem are they solving? So it's like basically figure out what problem they're having then very, through data, understand the problem and whether you are solving it. And then it's just keep it really simple. Clarity over cleverness essentially.

Robby Stein (00:57:02):
Exactly, yes. And be humble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):
And be humble. Yes. Okay, important. Is there an example that we haven't talked about that shows this in action of just, cool, here's the problem we found. Here's how we figured out this is the solution and if we're succeeding, and then here's a very simple way of solving it?

Robby Stein (00:57:19):
I mean honestly, this Close Friends example, I can give you more from Instagram days was really wild. It took two or three years to get Close Friends to work, and I think people, it totally failed originally. This is the product that lets you add a private list of people and then you can post to your story and then only those people see it. It's like this very exclusive private space so you can feel really comfortable sharing maybe more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Oh, green circle.

Robby Stein (00:57:40):
Green circles, yes. It's one of the most popular, at least when I was there, was one of the most popular features of Stories and did really well, but it totally failed. And I think what we found out was that you actually used a bunch of these techniques here. So one was we first thought about it as an overall system problem and you could add a Close Friends post for anything. So you could do a feed post or a Stories post, and you also had a close friend's profile. You could see, if Lenny went to Robby's page, we were Close Friends, you would just be like, "Oh, you get to see extra stuff from me on my profile too."

(00:58:18):
So we shipped it, we thought it would be great. This is the be humble part, wasn't great, had a bunch of, it was just super confusing. You would see this really beautiful photo and then in the feed right after it, this blurry, very vulnerable moment someone's trying to share with their friends, just felt so out of place and weird for the reason people use feed. And then it was just confusing because it had an extra little green thing on it, but it was like that got a green thing and the Stories one didn't. If you open the story, it had a green thing inside the story, and people were just so confused.

(00:58:49):
And it had this other issue with the list where you're like, "Okay, the list doesn't work because it's mistranslated and people don't get it." I think it was actually called originally favorites, I want to say, and that encouraged people to just do two people on it. But then the way that it worked was, so this gets to the framework, I guess. So deeply understand people. What are people trying to do with this?

(00:59:10):
What they're trying to do is share a vulnerable thing and be like, "Hey, I'm lonely. Hey, what's going on? Are people up?" And it feels very much like a friend group thing.

(00:59:18):
And if you only have two people on it, the job that we're doing is actually connecting you to your friends. And if you don't get a DM back, it's broken. And so really what we're doing is getting you a DM and we're getting you connection. We're getting you a sense of being connected to your Close Friends. That is the job.

(00:59:33):
It's actually everything Clayton Christensen talked about in the book is there are utility jobs and there are emotional jobs. People usually discount the emotional ones a lot. This was really an emotional thing as much as it was utility one, and so product's broken, right? And people don't even know that it's a close friend story, they just see the little head because you have to click on it to see the thing. And so it just, people stopped using it.

(00:59:56):
We went through and we did these revs where we would simplify it and we would update it and we would go through this change list. Okay, take this out, take this out, change the name, here. And then we saw it was that it was working really well for people who added 20 to 30 people to their list. Because what would happen is you put 30 people on your list and then two of them would write back to you on DM and now you have closed the loop and you feel connected to those people. It's a winning thing. And so we designed the whole system around that, and also only worked in Stories. We were looking at the data, we were trying to understand where it was working and where it was failing, and then we updated the name to Close Friends so it didn't feel like favorites. So it wasn't three people, it's 20.

(01:00:34):
In the list, we built this list builder where we recommended a set of people based on some cool algo that was created by an engineer. And then we updated the design to put the green ring on the outside of the story so that this was the design for clarity. We were being cute. We thought, I think at the time it was like, "Oh, it's a secret story or something, and if you open it, you see it."

(01:00:56):
It just was not clear to people. And so we put the green ring on the outside so that users would see it in the tray and be like, "Ooh, what's that little green guy?"

(01:01:04):
And then they'd click on it and be like, "Oh, this is a private story for me." That system worked and did incredibly well, and that was the process we followed from a total flop to something that was very successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
That is an awesome example. And this took two or three years, you said this process?

Robby Stein (01:01:19):
Yeah, it took a while. That was actually one of the longest projects we worked on, but that actually came, the reason we did it was when we asked people to understand people like, "Why aren't you posting to your story? What's preventing you from doing it?"

(01:01:32):
And everyone had some version of, "Well, my ex is on it. I have a teacher on it. Oh, a friend that kind of is judgy is on it."

(01:01:39):
It was like this commonality was audience problem. Someone had an issue with people watching them. And so that gave us conviction to go this hard at it for so long because we knew that that was a core problem with the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:51):
Was this connected to the Finsta, Rinsta trend also?

Robby Stein (01:01:55):
It was actually. I think that informed us. Everyone had a Finsta and there was a Binsta.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
Was is a Binsta?

Robby Stein (01:02:00):
Best friend Insta.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
I see.

Robby Stein (01:02:03):
Different, it's this layering of people 20 Finstas down to your partner, Pinsta, and then it's basically like, I made that up. I don't know if it's true, but I'm sure it was out there somewhere. We were like, "Wow. People clearly are trying to hack Instagram basically to create these private smaller group settings, and so we should just make a product."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
How did you actually do this testing? Was it rolled out to some percentage? Was it rolled out in New Zealand or whatever?

Robby Stein (01:02:27):
Yeah, we rolled it out in a few other countries, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
Okay,

Robby Stein (01:02:29):
Got it. We had a basket of countries that we tried it in and then we would do research. I think it was Australia was one of the first ones for that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):
Okay. I was going to ask if you can share the country. So Australia.

Robby Stein (01:02:40):
I think that was one of the earlier ones, yeah, but every time you ship something there's a slightly different reason why.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:46):
Oh, interesting. So it's not always Australia gets all the new stuff.

Robby Stein (01:02:49):
No, although it sometimes is. Australia and Canada get a lot of stuff just because easier for the teams to see feedback from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:57):
Yeah, speak English.

Robby Stein (01:02:59):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:00):
Awesome, okay, let me go in a different direction and talk about something that you have a hot take on. There's a lot of talk these days about lean teams, small teams, just creating limited resources, not hiring at all. You have an opposite perspective of you actually need a lot of resources to build really big breakthroughs. Talk about your experience there.

Robby Stein (01:03:19):
Yeah, I mean I think there's obviously, depends on what you're trying to build and there's been famously small teams building big impact products, but I think there's this cult of lean, scrappy, fast, throw away your product quickly, keep moving. And I think at some level it's true for internal conviction, but to build a product that works for a lot of people that is based on a technological breakthrough. A lot of times, I see teams just give up to early or under invest in the product, and obviously the space matters. And if you're building a single product that is a way to, I don't know, do something with a digital app that's fairly straightforward, that's going to be different than building a robotics company. So what you're building does change.

(01:04:02):
But even for software, I mean I think for really hard technical problems, think about the amount of time and effort it took for teams to build a foundational model, and how many years and hundreds and hundreds of people that were needed for that to happen. And you think about these large companies that have had huge impacts on people, and I think particularly for bigger companies internally, something I've seen is it's almost too scrappy because it never gets enough momentum. The product never gets good enough internally and then it just dies on the vine. Whereas if you put more people on it, you have to be careful not to put too many too soon. But I see the opposite more true where people hold on to small teams too long and then you, either takes forever to get to the thing you're looking for.

(01:04:46):
This Close Friends example I mentioned this actually was a small team. One of the reasons it took us forever was it kept the team so small and scrappy. That loop cycle was so short and by a startup age you'd be dead probably. So you can maybe do that in a bigger company, but as a startup, I don't know if you have that leisure. And so I think you need to actually think what is the group I need to build a version that's great. And from first principles, really think about it instead of just embracing blindly, okay, we're going to be the two of us until this thing has escaped velocity market fit, which it's not always true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
This is definitely counter to the narrative we see on Twitter. Anything you can share about just the heuristic you use to decide here's how long to keep it small? I know there's not going to be this step 1, 2, 3, but just like what I'm hearing is start small to prove out the concept designer PM engineer maybe. When do you find that makes sense to go big?

Robby Stein (01:05:40):
Yeah, I think that it's mostly when you've hit the conviction moment. I think there's two big milestones. There's internal conviction. For yourself, do you believe in it? And you believe in it because there's some external validation, your friends, you put 20 friends on it. And by the way, I found out very quickly building startups that if you put 20 friends on something, they're not going to do you that many favors. They're not going to use a product every single day because they're your friend 30 days in, 60 days in, 90 days in. They're not using your product unless you're doing something that's useful to them. And so you get all of this feedback and you're seeing people really enjoy it. You get to that moment.

(01:06:17):
And then I think that's not a product that would win externally because if you were to ship it, it's broken, doesn't work great. And then you need to, I think invest enough to make the best version of it or as good a version as you can to get it out the door and to ship it. And I think that that, it's like you want to build the right product eventually is the mentality and you can only really do that with the right group.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:39):
I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call AI Corner.

Robby Stein (01:06:43):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):
What's some way that you've found use for AI in your work, in your life that is really interesting, really helpful, maybe other people can be inspired by?

Robby Stein (01:06:53):
I think one of the coolest trends ever is how AI is affecting multimodal visual and inspirational needs for people. And we're early in this and I think this is something that I'm actually working on as a project as well, but right now if you think about what AI has done in large part, it was born and grew up in this text modality, it was chat. And so for a long time, if you were to ask it to help you, what's a cool way to redecorate your bookshelf behind you? It's going to describe that to you in text, because that's what it knows. But increasingly, AI is going to be liberated to help in every possible modality.

(01:07:29):
This is something that we've seen a lot with this explosive use of Google Lens and our image search and image features and with this deep understanding, and what I'm actually starting to use internally and some things that we're excited about more coming up that we actually announced at I/O that we're going to going to be building more of was how AI can help with inspiration, how AI can help with shopping and helping you really get things done that are more in the inspiring bucket of needs versus these core utilities like code, math, homework side of things.

(01:08:04):
And I'm really excited for things that are coming where you can ask it for inspirational tasks and it's starting to do really fascinating things in terms of what I'm seeing and hopefully we'll share more on that soon. But I think the one thing I can share is there's a visual version of AI Mode that basically we talked about at I/O, and so you can reference some of those keynotes, but that's in the process of being rolled out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):
Mysterious.

Robby Stein (01:08:34):
And so you're going to be able to now ask what's a mid-century modern beautiful office design with dark themes? It'll be able to produce this image board that's inspirational and you can do multi-turn with it. And so you'll be able to go and say, "Actually, I want more of a light theme, more creamy, more California, more coastal vibe." And it'll do that and it'll understand that and it'll actually see the images and be able to turn with you in the way that text works, which is going to be really cool. So I think that's going to be one of the more exciting things that will be new to AI soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:10):
What I'm hearing is Nano Banana integrated into AI Mode. Recipe for success.

Robby Stein (01:09:14):
Well, it's a little different than Nano Banana because Nano Banana is an image editor. This is more like helping you find images on the web, so it's a little bit more like AI inspiration, AI image search, and allowing you to then talk with two effectively visual responses with natural language. So that's going to I think, be a little bit different than edit this photo so that it changes it. Although potentially an interesting idea too, to have an ability to take a picture of your living room. And I think AI will help with that too ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:48):
Pinterest is in trouble, feels like this is what people use Pinterest for. Here's all the inspiration. Now it's just AI doing it all. By the way, Nano Banana, where does this name come from?

Robby Stein (01:09:58):
I don't actually, I forget that. There's a story somewhere. I forget it now honestly. But the team I think came from a scrappy, fun group of people building this and they wanted to go for something fun for folks to-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:13):
Yeah, it feels like that's a part of the reason things have started to work. There's just more fun and delight and random crazy stuff coming out.

Robby Stein (01:10:20):
It does. It feels a little more like when I was at Google the first time through right now where you just have so much stuff and this kind of fun curiosity happening where people want to try things and ship things and yeah, hopefully that continues.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:31):
Yeah, it feels like Veo 3 would be even more successful if it had a wacky name. And I like that this is the opposite of your advice of clarity. I don't know what Nano Banana is, but it worked.

Robby Stein (01:10:42):
Yeah, it's the other thing. No advice is right universally, right? But yeah, Nano Banana.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:49):
Robby, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with as a final nugget of wisdom before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Robby Stein (01:10:58):
This concept: be curious. I think of embodying everything as like it's really about curiosity. It's about wanting to know why everything is the way it is. Why is someone doing something? Why does someone have a different opinion than I do? Why might this not be working? And the people who really have that level of intense curiosity and they chase things down until they know, I think you're well served by that. That would be my only parting thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Let me follow that thread actually, because it's maybe the most trending term on the podcast over the past few months is curiosity. It comes up a lot when I ask people, what are you teaching your kids and embracing with the rise of AI and curiosity comes up all the time. Is there anything that helps you? Is it just like I am good at this and I am curious innately and I'm just, "This is valuable." Is there anything you can share that helps you or others around you embody that and actually be curious?

Robby Stein (01:11:48):
Well, I mean AI is obviously the ultimate curiosity engine, and that's what's so cool is you can now ask anything and just get information. And so I find that people just appreciate just how much they can learn about whatever they want. But also, I think that a lot of this also comes down to studying what you want to know about, and knowing where the branches of knowledge live there. A lot of times I'll read old papers and PDFs that are free online on a statistics thing if I want to learn about that and I think people under appreciate those. There's analog old school great learning and AI can help you discover them. I'm using AI, I'm particularly at Google to help discover all these cool links and things to read, but I find that that is an interesting hybrid where it's not just AI but really going to original sources more. I find that these books I mentioned on the chat here, I find that you need a blend of all of those things to ultimately really get to the bottom of things ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:46):
Actually reading the thing, not just reading the summary of the thing.

Robby Stein (01:12:48):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:49):
Let me actually ask you this question I've been asking all these people that are at the cutting edge of AI. You have kids, is there anything you're thinking about and leaning into helping them learn, develop as AI emerges and becomes a big part of the world?

Robby Stein (01:13:04):
The biggest thing I'm doing, I have younger kids, so the biggest thing I'm doing is they're using live versions of AI that they just talk to now much more. And so funny enough, we actually just launched search live actually out of Labs this week. And so you can talk to search in a live AI setting, which is conversational voice. Voice on when you're driving, you can just talk all the knowledge I talked about where you can do with Google, you can talk to it in a normal conversation with your voice. And I found that to be incredibly accessible for kids.

(01:13:31):
And I hear all my kids come home, they're like, "Can I talk to Google about something?"

(01:13:34):
"What do you need? What do you need to say?"

(01:13:36):
And then they go to my app, they hit the live button and they just start talking to it. They want to know about animals, they want to know about certain, I don't know, history things. They learn about something in school, and it's so natural to learn in that way that I think that that's helping them become much more AI native than any other thing I'm doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:56):
Life as a parent is going to be way too easy now whenever kids have questions, "Just go talk to the AI," but I don't think that's bad. So this is within the Google search app. There's a live, how do you access this?

Robby Stein (01:14:07):
Yeah, that's exactly right. You go to Google app, so there's one of the apps in the App Store you mentioned. You open Google and there's a button now that's live on it, right on the home screen. And if you tap on, it's a live version of AI Mode that you can just talk to. It's a full screen experience, and we'll say start talking.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):
In the show notes, I'm going to link to this project that somebody built, Eric Antonow, which I love. It basically shows you how to put a little speaker into a little stuffed animal and you connect the speaker to, it could be Google Live or it could be ChatGPT, whatever you like, in voice mode. And you put it on your shoulder, you get a little magnet that attaches, and your kids could talk to this parrot, for example, and you could tell it, "Talk in a pirate voice," and so they're talking to his pirate.

Robby Stein (01:14:49):
Oh, that's really funny. Okay, that's really cute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:51):
It takes 15 minutes. You could get an X-Acto knife and sew it and stuff and it's fun. I made one for my nephew and he was looking for treasure with this parrot.

Robby Stein (01:14:59):
That's really adorable, I'm definitely going to look into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:02):
Robby, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Robby Stein (01:15:07):
All right, I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:08):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Robby Stein (01:15:11):
I mean, definitely the two I mentioned here. Clayton Christensen, Competing Against Luck. Don Norman, Design of Everyday Things. But I also really love this for fiction, Aurora, which is this book David Koepp wrote. It's about electromagnetic pulse in the sun that knocks out, it's fiction for just fun. And it was a really fun beach read and apparently it was going to be made into a Netflix show, it didn't work out. I don't know. It was sad to see that fall apart, but so it's a really fun book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):
There's a book along those lines that I love, they're making a movie of it right now called Hail Mary.

Robby Stein (01:15:43):
Oh, I'm in the middle of reading that right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):
Okay, awesome.

Robby Stein (01:15:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):
Of the same mind.

Robby Stein (01:15:48):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
Yeah, they're making a movie of it. How about that?

Robby Stein (01:15:50):
In the middle of reading it. It's getting wacky where I am right now, but I'm excited to see where it goes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
It gets wackier. The ending especially wacky.

Robby Stein (01:15:55):
Oh, really? Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:56):
Just prepare yourself.

Robby Stein (01:15:57):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):
What is a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Robby Stein (01:16:02):
I love The Bear. I think that's just absolutely awesome show. Dune, of course. And I thought the new Top Gun is a little old now, but I think the new Top Gun was so fun and awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:13):
Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love? It cannot be AI Mode.

Robby Stein (01:16:17):
I'm going to use a non-digital product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:19):
Perfect.

Robby Stein (01:16:20):
I'm super into this new pillow that I got called Purple Pillow, and I've been recommending it to everyone at work. We're on a pillow chat now. It's a thing. It's like you talk about what pillows we're getting, but it's this really cool thing where it's got this new technology of this honeycomb polymer that's inside and so it supports you and it has these little micro holes so it doesn't get hot. It's really cool. Big fan. Strongly recommend Purple Pillow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:50):
I've never heard of this thing, I am excited. I recently got an avocado pillow, focusing on low toxins.

Robby Stein (01:16:57):
Oh, those are good. I've heard good things about those too, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:00):
Okay, I got to join this pillow. Pillow talk is a great name for it by the way.

Robby Stein (01:17:04):
You're into pillows too. That's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Huge.

Robby Stein (01:17:06):
I love bedding.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
No, I'm just joking.

Robby Stein (01:17:07):
Yeah, great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):
But I did upgrade my pillow. This is not Mr. Pillow, whatever that guy is, right? Is that guy that, there's like a controversial pillow guy. Okay.

Robby Stein (01:17:17):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:17):
Okay. Purple Pillow. I'm going to ask AI Mode.

Robby Stein (01:17:20):
Yeah, you should.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:20):
This.

Robby Stein (01:17:20):
Definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:22):
Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to in life?

Robby Stein (01:17:28):
This is be curious. I think I almost named a company Curious. I just think it's a really awesome, there's one thing in life. It's that in terms of getting things done, in terms of understanding the world, people, your kids, your family. You always just want to know more and question things outside yourself, not feel like you have all the answers. I think that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:49):
I love that. Final question, okay, so speaking of startups, you started a company called Stamped back in the day, it got acquired by Yahoo. I hear there's a story where you got Justin Bieber on your app and that was a big deal and a big inflection in the success of the app. Can you just tell that story?

Robby Stein (01:18:06):
Yeah, it's a wild story. Just to scene set a little bit. I was 25 right after Google being an IC PM in New York with some Google friends building this company. So very early on, and maybe in a good way and no idea what I was doing. But basically we decided that the concept of Stamped was to put your stamp on your favorite things, get recommendations from friends and from people that you trust. And so you think of a Twitter feed, but it's all stuff that people think is cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
Which products.

Robby Stein (01:18:35):
It's like books, restaurants, food. Products, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:37):
Pillows, possibly.

Robby Stein (01:18:37):
Pillows could be on there. I would totally stamp this pillow and then you could discover it. And one of the cold star problems was obviously you want a group of people that are on it that are already using it, that could have some tastemaker type folks. We had a bunch of people that were chefs and we had people who were literary folks. And then we wanted to get a couple people that were more musicians, artists, and these influential folks.

(01:19:00):
My co-founder and I just basically got the contact of Scooter Braun, who's Justin's manager, and we just sent out an email and we were like, "Hey, we're in New York. We're going to be in LA tomorrow." I think we said something, I don't remember all the details, but it was something like tomorrow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:15):
And you were not going to be in LA tomorrow.

Robby Stein (01:19:16):
No, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:17):
Okay.

Robby Stein (01:19:17):
"Do you happen to be there?"

(01:19:19):
And he just wrote back some one line thing like, "Meet me at this hotel for breakfast at something."

(01:19:25):
And we're like, "Oh, okay."

(01:19:28):
We literally went immediately to the airport. I just remember just basically going straight to the airport, flying to LA meeting with him. We gave him the whole pitch, we showed him the product, and then he was like, "Okay, I think this would be super cool. We can be involved and maybe you can help be an advisor."

(01:19:44):
And we ended up going back and meeting with Justin and showing him the product and even filming some little clips with him. It was actually really funny and it was a really fun moment. And obviously he was using it to stamp his favorite stuff. And so people would go, "Oh, Justin's into this song, or he is into this stuff," and would post that.

(01:20:02):
It was one of the ways that we got lots of people to try out and see what we were doing. That's a little extra scrappy moment in time, but I think it embodies a good lesson. Just do it now, be scrappy, be immediate. Intense urgency usually wins over thinking about it for a long time, and that's certainly proved to be true on that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:20):
Incredible story, thank you for sharing that. So many lessons to take away. Two final questions, where can folks find online if they want to reach out, maybe learn more about what you're doing and how can listeners be useful to you?

Robby Stein (01:20:31):
Yeah, I think on X @rmstein is probably the best single place. And then to be helpful, send me feedback. DM me, just mention me, ping me, let me know problems with Google products, with AI in general, but also just anything. As I said before, you have to always listen to people understand their experiences, so ping the ideas and feedback. That's the best way to be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:52):
Wow. What an onslaught you're about to receive of feedback on the search experience.

Robby Stein (01:20:56):
No problem. Yes, please do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:58):
"Robby, why is this link second? Why is my site not at the top?" I can only imagine the kind of stuff people complain about. Robby, thank you so much for being here.

Robby Stein (01:21:08):
Thank you, it was great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):
It was great. Bye, everyone.

Robby Stein (01:21:11):

# 5 essential questions to craft a winning strategy | Roger Martin (author, advisor, speaker)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Why are so many people bad at strategy?

Roger Martin (00:00:02):
What's taught now in business schools generally sucks. People aren't prepared educationally, and they sure don't get prepared for it in companies. It's intellectually challenging and it's emotionally intimidating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have something you call the strategy choice cascade.

Roger Martin (00:00:18):
You have to have answers to five questions. What's your winning aspiration? Where to play? How can you win? What capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't? And then, what enabling management systems do you have to put in place? For the most part, in the leading business schools, it's illegal to teach that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
Playing to win, you talked about, and there's kind of these two routes.

Roger Martin (00:00:38):
You have to be either differentiated or low cost, there's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
Is there anything else you wanted to just leave listeners with?

Roger Martin (00:00:46):
I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist. Great strategists have all one thing in common, they just practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Roger Martin. Roger is one of the world's most trusted strategy advisors. He's professor emeritus at the Rotman School of Management, at the University of Toronto, where he served as dean for five years. In 2013, he was named Global Dean of the Year, and in 2017 he was named the world's number one management thinker by Thinkers50. He's also the author of what many listeners consider their favorite book on strategy, called, Playing to Win. I've gotten a lot of requests to get Roger on this podcast, and I can now see why. This is the most tactical and fascinating conversation I've had on this podcast about developing a strategy, and that is a really high bar.

(00:01:38):
We delve into the five questions that you need to answer to help you craft your strategy. How Hamilton Helmer, Michael Porter, and Richard Rumelt's work fits into his framework and worldview, what people most often get wrong when they're developing their own strategy, the two options you have for how to win with your strategy, a very tactical and simple trick for getting started, thinking through your strategy, and so much more. This episode is for anyone who is trying to build their strategic thinking muscle. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app, or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Roger Martin.

(00:02:21):
Roger, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Roger Martin (00:02:24):
It's great to be here, Lenny, thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:27):
What I want to try to do with our time together is to help people that are on the ground at a company, say, like the product manager, designer, engineer, data scientists, folks that aren't necessarily the CO, or the founder or exec at company get better at product strategy. At crafting a strategy, evaluating strategy, developing a strategy. Because it feels like there's always tons of advice for the leaders of a company, but less for people on the ground doing the thing. And I feel like, luckily, your stuff applies to everyone. So, how does that sound as a lens for-

Roger Martin (00:02:55):
That sounds great, and can I tell us a little story to that end?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:58):
Please.

Roger Martin (00:02:58):
So, recently there was a newspaper article saying that, pointing out that 10% of the S&P 500 CEOs, 10% are ex Proctor and Gamble people. It's an amazing number, like a stunningly high, high number. Why would that possibly be? I believe it's because at Procter and Gamble there is a view that people way down the organization, like let's just say the head and shoulders brand franchise leader, who reports to the head of shampoos and conditioners, who reports to the head of beauty care, who reports to the CEO, so at least four levels down in the organization, in the guts of the organization, Proctor understands that that individual, not the CEO, not the global president of beauty care, not the head of haircare, not the head of shampoos and conditioners, the brand manager makes super important strategic choices, and if they don't make them well, the brand does terribly. And so, I believe... And not many companies have enough of that attitude.

(00:04:13):
So, I'm a big believer that people down organization have to make really important strategic choices or bad things are going to happen, if they make really great ones, good things are going to happen, and they get trained to be a CEO someday. So, I'm with your thesis. But yours is counter, what I would say is normal. What is most normal is people at the top do strategy, and people down below do something, and it's usually called execution, and I hate that, I hate that term of art, for what it's worth. And so, I think you and I are singing from a bit of the same songbook, even if it's a minority songbook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
I just want to ask this broad question about strategy, why is strategy so hard? Why are so many people bad at strategy?

Roger Martin (00:07:09):
Perhaps the thing that makes it intellectually hardest is that it is an integrative activity. It answers to a bunch of questions that have to fit together and reinforce one another. So, that just makes it a little more complicated, it's not like saying, Lenny, what do you want for lunch? It's saying, Lenny, what kind of diet do you want that'll keep you healthy? And that includes breakfast, lunch, dinners, snacks, a whole bunch of other things that you got to fit together. So, it makes that harder to do intellectually. Another aspect of it is, it is intimidating. Strategy involves making choices to do some things and not other things, and it is often intimidating to say, oh dear, I have to cut these things off, and not do them, and actually make a decision that I'll be held accountable for potentially, or I'll even hold myself accountable for.

(00:08:21):
So, that's a second thing. It's harder emotionally, not harder intellectually. And then, there's the training aspect of it, the knowledge aspect of it, which is, what's taught now in strategy in business schools generally sucks. It's gone on a crazy theoretical bend, the strategy academy as a whole has fallen in love with a theory called the resource-based theory of the firm, that silly and nobody uses it out in the world. And so, students are no longer trained on useful strategy. And the other feeder into people learning strategy were the strategy consulting firms, but the strategy consulting firms, the so-called strategy consulting firms, do almost no strategy anymore because it's a little business compared to post-merger integration, digital transformation, and a bunch of other things. So, people aren't prepared educationally for it, and if they're not prepared educationally for it, then they sure don't get prepared for it in companies. It's intellectually challenging and it's emotionally intimidating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:40):
On this point, you made about how schools are teaching strategy wrong, how do you describe what the wrong approach is?

Roger Martin (00:09:46):
It's a theory that's sort of taken over, called the resource-based view of the firm, that was... In the world of academics, there's a weird place where the number one emotion is jealousy, and people were massively jealous of Mike Porter, who created many of the most important concepts of strategy when he wrote a book, Competitive Strategy, in 1980. And so, they needed to counter him because they just didn't like the fact that he was so prominent, and they decided they would say he was about positioning. So, they called his the positioning school, and they caricatured what he said, which he never did, but they said he said it's all about finding a place that is structurally attractive, and then milking it for everything you can.

(00:10:43):
We at the resource-based view of the firm think that strategy is all about building resources. And if you build resources, it's almost like if you build it, they will come. And that's what you should pay attention to. Now, the problem is, any resource that may be useful somewhere is not necessarily useful elsewhere. So, it begs the question, how would you think through what resources to invest in building? What would be a way of doing that, investing here, versus here, versus here? It's silent on that because it's a dumb theory, and it doesn't have anything useful to say, in my view, about that.

(00:11:33):
And so, when the students go out and say to their company, I'm going to do a VRIO analysis, or a VRIN, some people just roll their eyes at them, and so it doesn't get used. I've only seen it used, I've been in consulting companies for 42 years, and I've seen it used once. And the trust, as is usually the case, is that it's both. And that's why the model I use for strategies says a lot about where you play is important, that's one of the key questions, and your capabilities are important, and you've got to link those things together. But that's, for the most part in the leading business schools, it's illegal to teach that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:20):
Illegal to teach your approach.

Roger Martin (00:12:23):
Yes. I couldn't teach my approach at my own business school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):
What?

Roger Martin (00:12:26):
But when I was dean, the most powerful person, the departments, or areas as we call it, like strategic management is an area, they have 100% control over what's taught in strategic management, in finance, et cetera. The dean may be the most powerful person in the school, and I happened to be a super successful dean, so if anything, I was a super powerful dean, and students would beg me, they'd say, "Roger, you have 20 years of experience, you're sort of a famous consultant in strategy, and you've got these theories, please teach a course in it." Nope. I did do extracurricular stuff, where I had practice of one Saturday a year, teaching everything I knew to anybody who wanted to show up. But for credit, I was not allowed. And if you try to get a job at any business... The only exception might be Harvard Business School, maybe. But if you took the 49 other top business schools in America, and if asked the question, do you swear allegiance to the resource-based view of the firm? If you don't answer an enthusiastic yes, you have no chance of being hired, zero.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):
Wow. This academia drama, I had no idea.

Roger Martin (00:13:54):
A loyalty test.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):
This is unreal. Makes me even more excited to dive into your world, and your ways of seeing things. Before we do that, just we've had a few other strategy people on the podcast, it might be helpful to frame where they fit in the spectrum that you're describing. So-

Roger Martin (00:14:09):
Oh, okay. I may not know all of them, but you give me-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:12):
I imagine you do. So, we've had a Hamilton Helmer on the podcast, and then Richard Rumelt on the podcast. How do they relate, just for people to get into your stuff versus this dogma?

Roger Martin (00:14:25):
So, one of them is an academic, and one of them is a quasi-academic, or non-academic, like me. I was a tenured professor for many years, but don't consider myself an academic guy. I don't think Hamilton does, though I've never asked him-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:41):
He's an investor now.

Roger Martin (00:14:41):
... that question. Yeah. So, he's written a very, I think, useful book that would in some sense fit into my how to win box, right? I say strategies about how to win, and he has a, what I call, a categorical model. Here are categories of things that you should think about. If you're trying to win, here are seven ways of winning, and I categorize him as a non-academic practical strategy guy. Richard Rumelt is a now retired Tuck professor, and he is this hyper competition thing that he does. He also is of the, I'm jealous of Mike Porter kind of thing. So, I've got to say, Mike Porter is wrong, and here's how I am so right, and the competition doesn't take place in the way Mike says, where it's really stable, and whatever, it's really hyper competition, Mike Porter never in his entire life has said competition is stable, he's repeatedly said the opposite.

(00:15:54):
But in order to say I'm not like Mike Porter, and in fact, I distinguish myself by saying he's wrong, and I'm right, and so... I don't know. He seemed like a fine guy. I don't think that he, like most business academics, he doesn't know much about business. He hasn't gone out and practiced a lot. He came to our school, and gave a lecture because people loved hyper competition because he would blast Mike Porter, and he gave a example of Proctor and Gamble, I've been consulting at Proctor and Gamble, and know everything about Procter and Gamble, basically.

(00:16:42):
And what he said about Proctor and Gamble had zero to do with reality, like zero. It was just completely, utterly, absolutely wrong. And I asked him afterwards, just sort of like, "Why do you say that?" And he said, "Well, I think that's the way it worked." Are you kidding me? So, I'm not a fan of that piece of work. I would say it doesn't fit nicely into research-based view of the firm versus Mike Porter, it's sort of like, here's another lens to take on the world, and I'm going to take that lens, everything's hyper-competitive, and here's how you think about hyper-competition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):
This is fascinating. I love that we're spending some time on this, this is really helpful to hear the landscape of strategy minds. Okay, let's dive into your worldview, and maybe the simplest way is just, how do you define strategy? What is a strategy?

Roger Martin (00:17:48):
Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action. So, the way I think about it is, there's a whole bunch of things a company controls, how many factories to build, how much R&D to do, in what areas, and how much advertising to do, how many people to hire, what to pay them, blah, blah, blah... Those are all the things under our control. What, Lenny, is the thing we have almost no control over? What, if we're a company?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):
What customers do.

Roger Martin (00:18:21):
Yeah. We would like them to take some of these out of their pocket and give them to us, can we make them? No, we can't. So, essentially, the job of strategy is to make decisions on the things we do control that will compel, we can't force, but it'll compel them. They'll say, gosh, I should take my hard-earned cash, and whether it's a company or an individual, I should take my hard-earned cash and give it to you, rather than give it to nobody, if there's no product now, or give it to a competitive product. So, the important pieces of it is integrated, it's the whole set of choices that has that one outcome, that it compels desired customer action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:11):
Amazing. Okay. And to help people define their strategy, you have something you call the strategy choice cascade, which is basically five questions that you need to answer to help you think trough strategy. Can you talk through this?

Roger Martin (00:19:23):
Yeah. And this is the fruits of many, many years of doing strategy work, and trying to figure out, how do you do this thing? Because the fun thing was, I was in the era, I started in strategy in 1981, and that was early in the era, strategy was born in 1963 with the founding of Boston Consulting Group by Bruce Henderson, who was the father of strategy in my view, of practical commercial strategy. So, it was still in the early days, and Bruce Henderson had a theory of how strategy should... What result it should produce for you. Mike Porter then came along in 1980, so '63 Bruce Anderson, and '80 Porter, the two most important figures in the history of strategy, came along and said, a strategy has to look like this. It has to have this as its output. But neither of them was very good on, because again, it was early, they can't do everything right away, of, well, how would you get one of those?

(00:20:34):
So, Mike Porter says you have to be either differentiated or low cost. Good. And if you look through competitive strategy as landmark seminal book, to say, how would you do that? There is no answer. And because Monitor Company, the firm I was one of the leaders of for a decade and a half, was founded essentially to commercialize Mike Porter's work, customers would ask us, they'd say, well, we like Mike Porter, and we'd like to have one of those. We can look at ourselves under his framework, and we can say we're stuck in the middle, and he said, that's bad, and he said, good is this or this. How do we think through creating one of those? We didn't actually have an answer.

(00:21:22):
And it turned out, because I was the most, I don't know, intellectually engaged on this, and didn't mind the hard work of product development from about 1987, when we discovered we really didn't know that, and clients really wanted us to tell them that. Between 1987 and 1995, I did all this work on, well, how could you develop a process for getting yourself one of those, one of those excellent strategies? And I came to the view that you have to have answers to five questions. You have to have an answer to the question of, what's your winning aspiration? What are you trying to accomplish? Because it'll help contextualize the kinds of choices you could make. Then there's a where to play, on what playing field, or if you're like military stuff, battlefield, are you going to plop yourself down on? You're not going to play everywhere, in every product, at every vertical stage around the world, you're going to pick someplace, and in that place, how can you be either better than competitors, in terms of creating customer value, or lower cost than those competitors?

(00:22:38):
To win there, where you've chosen to play to meet your winning aspirations, what capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't, that would enable you to win that way? And then, what management systems, enabling management systems, do you have to put in place to make sure you build and maintain those must have capabilities to win, where you've chosen to play, to meet your winning aspiration? And so, I came to the conclusion, actually it was in 1995, the end of an eight-year journey, I came to the conclusion those were the five, and you had to do them together, and that is the essence of producing a strategy that compels desired customer action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:21):
I want to go through an example of a company, but before we do that, something I think that's important to talk about is, if your book is called Playing to Win, you talked about this idea of you need to play to win, and you argue that a lot of people are just playing to play, they're playing to play the game. I'm guessing most people listening, and most people developing a strategy, don't think they're doing that, they don't think they're just playing to play the game. They think they're playing to win. I'm curious what are signs that you're not actually playing to win?

Roger Martin (00:23:49):
It would be mainly signs given to you by customers. So, if you say, we're the most innovative company in our industry, and customers... And let's say the industry distributes through a given channel, and customers come into that channel and they look at the two products and say, I could flip a coin on this one, you are not effectively playing to win. Maybe you thought you were winning, but customers don't think you are better. Or if your competitor lowers their price compared to your price, and you say to yourself, oh my God, if we lowered our price, we would make no money, but your competitor keeps on pricing there, you may think you have the low cost position, but they do, and you have to give them whatever share they desire at that lower price because you can't compete there.

(00:24:56):
So, you'll know you're playing to play if you're not aiming to, and accomplishing, having either an offer where Lenny walks into the store, whatever kind of store it is, and says to the person in the store, I want that brand. An example, Lego, one of the companies I've worked with for a long time, great company. It turns out that if you do market research on kids, a store that purports to be a toy store but that doesn't have Lego is not a toy store. They would define it as not a toy. Mom, why are we here? I wanted to go to a toy store. And she said, but it says toys on here. And the kids said, uh-huh. That's an insane brand. That's an insane, insane, insane brand.

(00:25:54):
And it has a price premium for anything, over any of its competitors by a long shot. It keeps growing, it actually for most years in the last decade it has had 80 or 90% of the entire category growth is Lego. And so, they're playing to win, to be distinctive in the minds of consumers. But Vanguard has got $9 trillion of assets under management last time I checked. Does it do anything distinctive? Not really. The customer bought, do they have the lowest cost position so they can charge the lowest AUMs? Absolutely. And so, there's different kinds of ways, but you'd know by the actions that customers take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):
So, essentially, to mirror back what you're saying, to win, there's kind of these two routes you talk about. One is you're the lowest cost option, the second is you're differentiated. You have a differentiated brand, where it's not a coin flip, it's like, oh, I really need that for this reason.

Roger Martin (00:27:02):
Yes. Yeah, you got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
And if you can't do that, then the advice you share is go find a different playing field.

Roger Martin (00:27:11):
Well, or get out of business, whatever... It's only a matter of time until you're dead, is the sad truth of the matter, which is the competitors in your industry, who are either low cost or differentiated, can essentially jerk you around as much as they want. It's like Southwest Airlines, right? Southwest Airlines was just a tiny little airline that flew Austin, Houston, Dallas, and now it's number one in passenger seat miles in America, and the only airline that's earned its cost of capital over the last half century, all the rest are losing money for their shareholders over time. They have good cycles and bad cycles. How did that happen? Well, it's just the other airlines had to step aside whenever Southwest came into a route, the other airlines just had to say, well, I guess you're going to get your 30 share, or 35 share of passengers on this route, welcome to town. That's all they can do.

(00:28:15):
They just have to seed position. And that's what happens, if you play to play, you'll end up just being... It's literally like having a bully who can just shove you, and you take one step back, then they shove you, and you take another step back, and they shove you, and you take another step back. There's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two. You cannot bully Vanguard, you cannot bully Southwest, you cannot bully Proctor and Gamble, you cannot bully Lego. That's the way the business world works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
And in the case of Southwest, the reason they couldn't be bullied is they were the low cost provider and the other airlines couldn't meet their prices. So, they're like, all right, there's nothing we can do.

Roger Martin (00:29:04):
Yep, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:04):
Awesome.

Roger Martin (00:29:06):
So, while I was living in Boston, they entered the Boston to Chicago route, which was a duopoly of American and United at the time, and the price was about, in those days, a $1000 for a round trip because it was a nice duopoly. When Southwest come in, they say, we're going to fly Providence to Midway, not Logan to O'Hare, and it's going to be $200. And they had great advertising, I always loved the advertising that they had when they entered the, they did maps of Boston, and said, if you live in any of these places, kind of the south, the west of Boston, it takes you less time to get from your house to the gate than it does to go to Logan.

(00:29:56):
Because at Logan, you park in a parking garage, and then walk a half an hour, and then when you get through security, you still have to walk 20 minutes... Blah, blah, blah. And at Providence, if you've ever flown out of Providence, you can park about 100 yards from the gates. And so, they just had to say, we can't stop that, not everybody's going to do it, but a whole bunch of people are, and there's nothing we can do to stop that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):
What I love is we're already diving into these five questions. So we've been mostly talking about how we will win, basically, here's your options to win. Low cost provider, or be differentiated, or find a different place to win. Let me summarize the five again. What is our winning aspiration? Where will we play? How will we win? What capabilities must we have in place to win? And what management systems are required to make sure the capabilities are in place?

Roger Martin (00:30:44):
Right. You've got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Okay, cool.

Roger Martin (00:30:46):
You're a very quick study my friend.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):
I got some notes here. So, coming back to the how will we win? Because I think everyone's listening to this, okay, cool, we got two ways to win, we're going to be the cheapest or we're going to differentiate, okay. Okay, how do we differentiate? Is there a taxonomy of options that you think about or tell people, what are the ways and options for exploring, here's how we will be different?

Roger Martin (00:31:04):
It is mainly understanding customers, as well as you can, and then saying, is there a way to be distinctive against that? And there are lots of ways to do it, but it's tied very closely to the capabilities, which is, if you have a way of winning, you say, my where to play is I'm going to sell pet food on the internet, and my how to win is I'm going to be the best. But it turns out that anybody who can build a website can sell pet food on the internet, and in fact, 20 of them do it almost immediately, and they all go bust. You don't have the capability, so you've got to ask yourself the question, can I serve a particular customer need with a set of capabilities that are going to be hard to replicate by my competitors? They either can't do it, or they won't do it. And both are important questions because sometimes it won't.

(00:32:20):
Do you really think Walmart couldn't have built as good a website as Amazon, and at massive scale? I think they could have, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:30):
Yeah, probably. I don't know.

Roger Martin (00:32:33):
Did they? They didn't. They said, I hope this online thing doesn't really take off because that would be a pisser because we've got 5,000 stores across America, and we've got all that, and that would be a bummer. And so, they don't do anything for 10 years, giving Amazon the scale, so that Amazon then has this huge scale advantage on this, and network effects, and voila, you've got a competitive advantage that you didn't necessarily completely deserve. You needed the help of the player who stood to lose the most to hope that it wasn't going to happen. Same with Tesla, Tesla got a 10 year headstart, not because the OEMs couldn't, they could have, and of course GM did many, many years ago, create a fully functioning electric vehicle. But they couldn't figure out how the hell you make a buck on it, and so they didn't do it, giving Tesla the ability to establish a brand that people associate with that, electric vehicle equals Tesla, and allow them to jump way ahead, and then have the scale that is hard to hard for others to match.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:54):
You said something that's really interesting that I think is also really important, which is, you said that just being the best or better is not a solution. You can have a better pet food, you implied that's not going to get you there. Can you talk a bit about that?

Roger Martin (00:34:06):
Yeah. You have to answer a second question I guess, which is, here's the way I'm going to be better, and here's the way somebody else isn't going to be able to simply replicate that quickly. One of my favorite businesses, because I was on the board of Thomson Reuters for 14 years, it was Thomson first and then they bought Reuters, so Thomson Reuters. Best business is a business called Westlaw, and it's the dominant provider of online legal searches. So, if you're a litigator, and you're trying to, you're getting ready for a case, and you need to know what are the important precedents for this case, you go on to Westlaw, and put in some search terms using a Westlaw keyword system to help with it, and you get the five cases that really matter. You can Google it, and do the same thing, and you'll get the 500 cases that might matter.

(00:35:11):
How does Westlaw do that? Well, for now over 100 years, they've taken every case that's come out of the US legal system, had a lawyer, a Westlaw lawyer, write a head note that summarizes what's in the case, using these keywords so that they were searchable, and today, to do 2024, takes 1500 full-time lawyers. So, if somebody else said, this Westlaw business is incredibly profitable, and it keeps growing, and it's awesome, I'd like to be in that business... All they'd have to do is hire 150,000 lawyers full time, and you'd have to create a numbering system and a keyword system that's different than Westlaw's, and then you'd have to do what Westlaw has done for the past 50 years, which is give it free to law schools so that they teach their students before they even get out how to use Westlaw, and all...

(00:36:14):
No probs. That'll be easy, right? Nobody's even tried. Why bother? Life's too short. And that's the kind of capabilities you need to be able to say we'll win by having the searches that make the lawyer's job the most effective. And if it saves them time, it saves them money. And you don't need a huge law library. Law firms used to have these huge law libraries, you don't need one, you need a terminal, or actually, now it's on everybody's PC. And you don't need a bunch of librarians to go and find the cases that you need, they pop up on your screen. That's a great case of competitive advantage.

So, essentially, we're talking about moats. What are some moat that you can create where people can't just copy what you're doing?

Roger Martin (00:38:18):
And Warren Buffett likes that terminology, right? That's what he says, he invests in moats.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
Yeah.

Roger Martin (00:38:25):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
I'll find the quote we used in a recent podcast episode, but he's like, castles with moats. And maybe along those lines, is there a way you think about types of barriers to recreate capabilities? It's like, here's the options we have, is it like... Essentially, the seven powers I think talks about this.

Roger Martin (00:38:43):
Yeah. Yeah. That's why I like Helmer, because he categorizes them. And I've got to look into it some more because I haven't studied it to say whether I would concur that there are just seven, or there are more. My suspicion might be that there are more, but there may not be. They may be all clustered, there may be variants that cluster behind those. But I don't, myself, have a categorization scheme that says, here's how you search for the moat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:20):
Great. That would be nice. So, here's the quote from Buffet, by the way, "I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."

Roger Martin (00:39:27):
Yes, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):
There we go.

Roger Martin (00:39:30):
I like that. And he's smart, he's consistent. Though, everybody makes mistakes, right? And he did too. Solomon Brothers, US Air... Anybody who thinks they can be perfect on strategy is delusional. And so, even the very, very best, like a Warren Buffet, who's outstanding, arguable genius, is going to sort of think, I think this is a moat, and it's going to be ephemeral. But any of us should be pleased to have a track record that would be anywhere close to that, on really identifying moats, because he has.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:11):
We talked about that with Hamilton Helmer, that every startup deck has, here's our moats, here's how we're going to have barriers to entry, and they're all delusional, rarely is there ever an actual moat, especially in the early stages.

Roger Martin (00:40:22):
Yes. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
Let's go back to the five questions again, because that's so core to the way you think about strategy. What do you think about using, say this FigJam as an example, as a hypothetical, just to think through questions that they might ask to think about strategy, and I can describe what FigJam is so you [inaudible 00:40:38]-

Roger Martin (00:40:38):
Sure, sure. I do not know that product-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):
Okay. It's basically a visual whiteboard collaboration tool, where people can put in sticky notes, and put little mocks, and kind of play around with all the cursors.

Roger Martin (00:40:46):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:47):
And so, it's for brainstorming, and ideation, and things like that, and laying out concept.

Roger Martin (00:40:52):
Gotcha. Okay, that would make sense for Figma.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):
Figma. Yeah, exactly.

Roger Martin (00:40:55):
Right. Okay. So, you'd asked the question, what are we trying to accomplish? Are we attempting to create something where nothing digital exists, people do this in pen and paper, and so we're trying to invent a category and then be transformative by making the user experience better? Is that what we're trying to do? Or are there players already doing this and they're just not doing it very well? You'd want to say, well, what are we trying to accomplish? And I don't spend a whole lot of time on that because you got to toggle back and forth between those five questions, but you have to have a reason for searching in a given space for where to play, how to win. What do you think their reason for thinking FigJam is worth investing in is? What do you think it is? Is it white space, or is it crummy offerings in the market currently?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:03):
If I had to get to it, I think they're trying to expand their market and they have a stronghold in design tooling, and there's this adjacent market for product teams broadly to be using Figma more. And there are existing tools similar to that, that are good.

Roger Martin (00:42:21):
Okay. So, I don't love it to start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:25):
Say more.

Roger Martin (00:42:26):
So, there's a big market over there, we'd like to get some, is a terrible reason in my view. The reason should be, customers are bereft, customers are lacking something that we can provide. This is why I hate... And most entries by foreign companies into China, they get their faces shot off. And the reason is the rationale is, it's big, we could get some of that. So, I don't love it, for starters. And I'm not saying that that'll guarantee failure, but if somebody gave me a review of a pitch deck for that, I would not invest [inaudible 00:43:14].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):
Well, I imagine you can also frame it in other terms, like our customers are demanding more ways to work within Figma with their teams, and there's these-

Roger Martin (00:43:22):
Yeah. So, that would be a better one. And you're speculating, I've asked you to speculate, so we don't know. But I like that one better, which is, what's our aspiration? It's to satisfied core customers, who love what we do, but think it's too narrow, that if we could broaden that for them, into this market, our customers would be very happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:47):
That is really cool. And so, you want to frame it in the words of how customers would benefit, essentially.

Roger Martin (00:43:52):
I just think those tend to be stronger, strongest, if there's a link. Because remember, what is strategy about? Compelling desired customer action. So, everything ties back to that. So, then the where to play would be, you just want to say, okay, what customers are we talking about, or what parts of our current customers that we don't serve are we attempting to serve with that? And with what product? Is it a finished product? Is it a component of a product? Through what distribution channel would we sell this? This is another self-serve type product. I think Figma is mainly self-serve, right? And so, you choose that where, and then say, how can we solve the problem?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:42):
Before we get to that, before we get to that real quick-

Roger Martin (00:44:44):
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, please. Please.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:45):
So, the things you mentioned there is who specifically are the customers? So, in this case it'd be like product managers, engineers, and other functions, and then there's the distribution channels, how we'd actually get to them?

Roger Martin (00:44:56):
Get to them, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
And then, what other questions are there within this where we will play?

Roger Martin (00:45:02):
To what extent is it a finished product or a component? Because sometimes it could be, we'd like to supply this component that could be integrated into other people's products. That's what Apple apps are, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:16):
Got it.

Roger Martin (00:45:16):
We don't sell them an iPhone, we sell them a component within the iPhone, a customer's iPhone, is that what we're doing here? Because then you have to ask questions about, well, how does it fit in with the rest?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
So, the where also implies where in the product it lives? Where-

Roger Martin (00:45:37):
At what vertical stage? Is it an integrated product, where it's the whole thing from soup to nuts? Is it some upstream pieces that some people downstream? Do we take pieces from other people and assemble them? So, we're the integrator? Those are all important where to play choices, from my view, because those make a big difference. Like Four Seasons chose... Four Seasons the hotel company, luxury hotel, chose a completely different choice on the vertical stage where to play, back in the 80s, they said we're going to get out of real estate development... So buying land and getting it zoned for hotels. We're going to get out of construction, building hotels. We're even going to get out of the business of owning the land or the hotel, so that we can be awesome at hotel management.

(00:46:35):
Rich people, like Michael Dell, and David Thompson, and Bill Gates will own the hotels, as an investment, and they will be happy to have Four Seasons brand on their hotel, and we will charge a management fee. That is a where to play choice. Even though somebody could say, well, you're a luxury hotel, you're like the other luxury hotels who serve luxury customers at a high price. Oh no, no, no, no, no, they do it with a stack this thick, we do it with a stack this thin.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):
So, it's like a value chain question. Where in the value chain are you going to play?

Roger Martin (00:47:13):
Value chain. Yeah. Where in the value chain? That's exactly right. And everybody has value chain questions. They often complain, after the fact, like all the apps complain about what cut Apple is taking, but they made a choice, a value chain choice. We are going to design something that will appear on an iPhone, or an Android device, if it's that case, and then good luck to you. You can complain like crazy that they're taking so much of it, and this is unfair, and they've got to duopoly... Yeah, but you guys cooperated 100% in building that. 100%, never complained about it, until you wanted a bigger piece of the pie. That was a vertical stage, a value chain stage, that you chose, willingly. Nobody forced you to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:05):
And Apple's not playing ball, giving it back too easily.

Roger Martin (00:48:10):
No. No. And do I love just how controlling and everything Apple is? Do I? No, but would I say, oh, those poor apps, right? Yeah, no, get your own distribution channel, buddy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:26):
Cold blooded.

Roger Martin (00:48:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:28):
Okay, so we've talked about the winning aspirations, so for FigJam, it would be satisfy customers that are trying to work with their team in these different ways, and make sure they're staying, make sure they get what they need out of Figma, versus go maybe to other tools. And then, where will we play? Let's say, engineers, product managers is trying to target them, distribution through the existing product, and so it's like a feature of the existing product. And then, it's how will we win? How do you think about that?

Roger Martin (00:48:57):
Yeah, yeah. Well, you ask the question, how can we solve... Well, how can we either solve that problem at a much lower cost, so we can always be a sharper price point than them? So, if there are solutions, but they cost 50,000 a user because their costs are 30,000 a user, we can do this for $15 a user, and so we can charge $100 per seat, and absolutely annihilate the competitor by figuring out a less costly way to do it. Or there are other selections, but they make the user do all these things, and it's ponderous, and it takes a long time... We have shortcuts, we use AI to, you just say a few words into it, and they say, oh yeah, I know what you mean, and here it goes in the workflow.

(00:49:54):
Or we're more integrated, like Thomson Reuters, the company I was on the board of, our advantage was we were better integrated into the workflow. You didn't have to get out of your workflow to go use this product, and then you get back in, we just said, what's your workflow? Oh, well, integrated. Is it better integrated into their workflow that makes their life easier? It would be questions, possibilities like that that I would be asking. Essentially, you've got to have a theory there, of how are you going to be better or lower cost.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
On the lower cost front, I think generally the advice is you don't want to go that route, that's a very difficult route. What's your thinking of just when to go that route that you might actually win at lower costs?

Roger Martin (00:50:45):
That's not advice I give. I think they're both completely legitimate strategies. They have implications. So, if you want to be the cost leader, it is rare that you can be the cost leader without having dominant scale in the territory in which you're operating. So, if you want to be a niche cost leader, good luck to you, that's almost never going to happen. So, Vanguard had to make a race to, we're going to do index mutual funds, and it doesn't exist now, we're going to do it and we're going to get gigantic, and we can't let anybody get close to us in size because we want to have the lowest cost position. And so, they are the world's biggest mutual fund company, and you have to do that, and same with Southwest, to really make that model work, they had to keep expanding and expanding to get bigger.

(00:51:45):
M&M Mars... It takes an enormous amount of commitment to say, we're going to go, and we're just going to keep charging ahead on this. Whereas, in differentiation, I think you can differentiate sometimes at lower scale, and build yourself slowly towards higher scale. But the business world is just getting so much more scale sensitive. When you think about the costs of differentiation, it's often spending on branding, spending on R&D, R&D innovation. Those two are of the most scale sensitive elements of anybody's cost structure. And so, being a niche-y differentiator is getting harder and harder in my view.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:35):
I think it's also important to say, either path is very hard, it's very hard to build a business that makes money and is profitable and survives just broadly.

Roger Martin (00:52:43):
Yes, yes, I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:44):
And you're not going to have this formula of how to win, okay, we got it. We got a big business.

Roger Martin (00:52:49):
I agree. I agree. And that's why, if I looked at 100 strategies of major companies, I'd say I didn't like 90 of them very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):
And then, the other nine out of 10 probably look good, but also don't work out.

Roger Martin (00:53:06):
Yes. Yeah, no, that's true. There's lots of spaghetti thrown at lots of walls in the world of business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):
Yeah, capitalism.

Roger Martin (00:53:16):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):
Okay. So, now we're at the capability step of trying to figure out what capabilities you need to win. Can you talk about, say with FigJam, what are the sorts of things you think about here?

Roger Martin (00:53:26):
Well, I guess I'd ask myself questions, like, is there a learning curve to this, where we could have better capabilities because we started earlier than anybody else, and have more essentially cumulative experience? Is there a way that we've figured out how to serve customers that make them feel tended to better by us? So, we've got helpline... We figured out how to do the helpline, because if it's self-serve and that's how they get the product, and then they've got issues with how to use it, they feel that we're just better. We're the best of all their providers at that. How to win is a theory of how customers are going to perceive us better, if we're differentiated. And then, it's what capabilities would we have to have to make that theory come true, rather than just be a wish. So, if we want them to feel like we're the easiest to deal with, we have to have capabilities to do that.

(00:54:47):
It's just like again, Four Seasons said the reason they're by far and away the most successful, profitable, best in all fronts, luxury hotel chain in the world... Biggest, best, most profitable, best employee rankings, best guest rankings, all of those. Well, their how to win was they said, people, if you talk to people who are in luxury hotels, they'd rather not be there. You'd say, wow, they're in the lap of luxury, why would that be? Where do you think they'd prefer to be, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
At home.

Roger Martin (00:55:21):
Yeah. Dominantly at home, for their segment, which was high-end business travelers. They've traveled, they've stayed in one luxury hotel too many 20 years ago. And so, we're going to have luxury defined as not grand architecture and decor and [inaudible 00:55:38] service, but rather, we're going to define it as a service that makes up for what you left at home or at the office.

(00:55:44):
Because people would rather be, if they have to not be at home, they'd rather be at the office than in a hotel because they can be more productive. So, we need capabilities, we need staff that can deliver on that capability. What's the problem, for that? The problem is turnover in the hotel industry globally is 80% a year, which means that the average person you meet, the average staff person you meet in the average hotel, is on their way to a 16-month career at that hotel chain. So, how do you deliver that really cool special kind of service with that? The answer is... And now I'm skipping ahead to enabling management systems.

(00:56:26):
You have to have a different way of recruiting, a different way of onboarding, a different way of career development. And if you do all of those things, you end up with a 10% turnover rate, so that your people are there 10 years on average, and you can then get them trained up to deliver that kind of service. So, that's the capability that you build, and the people, to be able to take more decision-making at a lower level, and treat the guests in a customized way that makes them feel that this wasn't by the book, some rule book, that this person just said, no, this is a good solution for my guest.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:01):
It's interesting that these capabilities and even the management systems, which is step five, relate to your moat. Which is the thing you need to achieve, also, ideally is the thing that other people, it'll make it hard for them to do.

Roger Martin (00:57:14):
Yep. So, you're exactly right. You can call if you want, how to win, moat, right? Definition of your moat. And so, capabilities and management systems are what both build and maintain the moat, and the maintaining is an important part because if you are the most successful, people are going to say, I want to do that too. But here's where there's this modern, unfortunately, bull shitty thing that says, oh, competitive advantage is fleeting in this modern hyper-competitive world, and you can't have long-term advantage anymore. And I just say, oh, I see. So, Four Seasons, I guess that isn't very long-term, that has only been 45 years now, since they... No, 35 years I should say. Don't exaggerate. Since they went to that strategy. Oh, and Tide. So, 77 years isn't a long time, I guess either, because they've been the number one detergent for 77 consecutive years. I guess you're right, it's fleeting.

(00:58:16):
It's not. But what makes it fleeting is when you have one thing, and one thing only. So, let's say you build the biggest polyethylene plant in the world, near a good feedstock source, and you have the low cost position, what's somebody else going to do when they see how much money you make doing that? Build a polyethylene plant beside yours, twice the size, and then you're toast. Why? Because the competitive advantage was too simple. But at Four Seasons, you got to sell off all your hotels, you got to fire all the people involved in hotel development and everything, and actually, the people in the business like doing that, you have to essentially get rid of your entire staff, start from scratch, paying them more than you do now by far, giving them more career security, giving them more training, giving them better uniforms, whatever, spending 10 times as much hiring them, with the hopes that maybe someday you'll be able to produce the kind of services Four Seasons does.

(00:59:24):
The competitors basically say, life's too short. Do they give up and die? No, there are other great chains, Mandarin Oriental, my wife loves staying in Mandarin Oriental, even more than Four Seasons often. But they've not said, we will replicate Four Seasons, they've said, we'll pick a different where, and a different how, and that's, in the end, what you want. Is rather than complete overlap, where you've got concentric circles of people picking the same where, you convince people to pick different wheres. That's why people sort of say, Roger, how to win, that's so impolitic, because you're producing losers, and then there's victims, and all that. There's oppressor and oppressive. It fits in the modern dialogue. And I say, no, what I want to do is encourage them to find someplace else to prosper, rather than smash on top of us.

(01:00:27):
And so, if you have completely different capabilities and management systems, it'll encourage people to choose a different where to play, how to win. If your capabilities and management systems are very similar to your competitors, and you're succeeding with your chosen where to play, how to win, what are they going to do? They're going to drive straight to your where to play and try to win exactly the same place and wreck your market for both of you. That's what you don't want. And the more complicated, in some sense... I shouldn't use complicated. The more nuanced and multifaceted your capabilities and management systems are, the more likely they're going to say life's too short. That's what everybody says about Southwest. So, if you're the only airline in the United States that's earning its cost of capital for 50 years, wouldn't you say, gee, I'd love to be like that? But what does it mean?

(01:01:29):
Well, it means selling off most of your aircraft, so that you can have only one kind of aircraft, 737. Tearing up your entire root structure, your entire hub and spoke structure, and make it point to point. Changing your complete labor relations strategy, from fighting the unions to paying them a lot, as long as they're highly flexible. People think Southwest is non-union, it's not unionized [inaudible 01:01:55], but they do different... You have to essentially fire all your travel agents, and convince your customers to book online, by themselves, to save more money. Life's too short, it's just too short. So, they try things like Continental Light, or Ted, that do half the things that Southwest does, and then you're what? A crappy Southwest. So, to me, that's the ultimate. The ultimate is, it's like the ultimate weapon is the one you never use. The ultimate way to compete to win is to never actually be forced to compete.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:38):
Wow, that's a great quote. This story about Southwest makes me think about Hamilton Helmer's counter-positioning, I don't know if you've heard that term, but basically, you position yourself in a way where the competitor can't do the thing that you're doing because of the way their business is already structured.

Roger Martin (01:02:57):
Ah, that's sounds right. The can't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:00):
Yeah, can't.

Roger Martin (01:03:00):
The can't thing. Awesome. Yeah, and Mike Porter, and he may quote Mike on that, Mike was very big on that. He said, it's fault lines. You're trying to find fault line, where it is so painful for your competitor to come across that fault line, into your side. And so, a great example of that would be Olay, at P&G, and it's in the book, when we did the repositioning of that. The competitor that could have killed us, absolutely killed us, was Estée Lauder with Clinique. If they would've brought Clinique into the mass channels... Because we were doing a Clinique kind of thing, in the mass channels, rather than the prestige. Prestige is like the first four of the department stores, which [inaudible 01:03:51] or Sephora, or Ulta. If Estée Lauder would've taken their Clinique brand and brought it into mass, they would've killed what we were doing. Simple as that.

(01:04:05):
And in fact, Clinique was the biggest brand in all of skincare, we became the biggest brand in all of skincare, and they didn't do it. Why? Are they idiots? No, they're not, Estée Lauder's super smart. But Estée Lauder also has Bobby Brown, and Mac, and the Estée Lauder, its own brand, and a half a dozen more, all in prestige, and the prestige channel, if they'd have taken Clinique, and taken it over into mass, would've done what? Shot them in the face. Killed them, right? They would've been just apoplectic. And so, Estée Lauder had to stay... If that's counter-positioning by Helmer's terms. They had to stay there. Was that stupid? No, they're still, with all of their brands combined, the biggest in skincare. But Clinique has lost leadership to our brand that they would've considered kind of nothing. Oil of Olay became Olay Olay ProV, Regenerist, all of these higher priced products than they could ever imagine being sold in the mass channel. But our biggest friend was, in some sense, their distribution channel, which would've killed them if we... Literally. They would've just punished them so, so, so bad that they didn't do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):
I love that I'm learning all this strategic thinking about makeup and skincare, I also love just the idea of you leading strategy for skincare and makeup brands.

Roger Martin (01:05:46):
Yeah, no, I got Proctor & Gamble into color cosmetics.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
So funny. [inaudible 01:05:51] love that. I don't know if you're following the AI Google stuff that's happening, where there's search engines competing with Google by just answering the question versus giving you a bunch of blue links?

Roger Martin (01:06:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):
And there's this question of, we'll Google Shift because people seem to really like it, versus they're making trillions of dollars running ads when they share blue links, and it's this super innovator's dilemma position they're in.

Roger Martin (01:06:14):
Yeah, no, no, I am very interested in what's going on in AI, and I'm writing some stuff on that. But it's hard. I've seen the inside of this for many of my clients, it is super hard when the guts of how you make money is under threat, and you just don't want that thing to go away. The big auto OEMs make money selling cars with ice engines, it's simple as that. And there's no surprise, they've been doing it for 100 years, they're way down the learning curve, they have scale, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so, these damn electric vehicles are kind of no fun. And so, the Google situation you've described, I think it's similar. But my general advice is always the same, which is, it can take a while, but in the end the customers will triumph. And A.G. Lafley, my friend who I co-wrote the book with, great CEO, was very good on this. And one of his big customers, big [inaudible 01:07:27] customers came to him and said, if you don't stop cooperating with Amazon, we're going to de-list all your products.

(01:07:35):
Big threat. Big threat. And A.G. just said, "If customers want to shop there, we just can't not be where our customers want to shop. And so, if you feel you need to do that, you're going to have to, because customers want to shop there, and we are not doing that. But what are you offended by, that we're doing there?" And they said, "Well, you are allowing them to ship products to their customers from your distribution centers." And A.G. just said, "Yeah? Do you want to too?" And they were like... And he just said, "We don't do anything special for them that we wouldn't do for you, they ask for things that you don't ask for because of their business model. But if you come to us with ideas of how we can help you serve our joint customers better, we're all in. But we're not boycotting a place that customers have shown they want to shop," as long as it's an honest, if Amazon was sleazy and dishonest or whatever, but an honest, upstanding place where customers can get our products.

(01:09:06):
And so, that's where I'm at, which is, you may have to scramble like hell, you may have to suffer from economic downturn, but if you think you can... I always think of it, I don't know if you did this as a kid, Lenny, but when we went to the beach on family trips, we would, I have four brothers, we would build... Plus then a baby girl later. But we would build sand castles and try to hold back the tide, this would be in Florida or California, and we'd try and hold back the tide, and we'd come the next morning to see if our castle... And it was always gone. It's gone. But we'd keep trying doing it, and it's sort of like, you can't hold back the tide. Maybe you can for a while, but you can't forever. So, you just have to figure out where are the customers going. And if they're going someplace...

(01:10:07):
And Vanguard did this, Jack Bogle, the late Jack Bogle, he died now, a couple of years ago now, he did not like ETFs. He said ETFs are not as good for customers as mutual funds. And he had all sorts of good reasons for that, but the index ETF business started to grow like crazy, and Jack had to relent and say, I don't think it's good for them, but they want it, and so they went whole hog into it, and are the leading index ETF provider, as well as the index mutual fund provider. But for a while they weren't, but he realized it was the tide, and he was attempting to hold back the tide. So, good luck. Good luck to you on that. So, to me, if Google thinks they can, because of their power and the fact they've got a multi-trillion dollar market cap, and they've got a near monopoly position on something, they can hold back the tide.

(01:11:09):
You see, the water finds a way to flow. Think about Microsoft and its monopoly on PC operating systems, or it's near monopoly on PC operating systems. And I would argue that they abuse that kind of monopoly. I often asked people, when's the last Windows update that got you as a customer excited?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:38):
Yeah, Windows 95.

Roger Martin (01:11:39):
The answer, I think is really clear, Windows 95, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:43):
Yeah.

Roger Martin (01:11:44):
Because that's when he took the graphical user interface that he bought rights to from Steve Jobs and put it on, so you didn't have to do backslash backslash... You could actually point and click. That's a long time ago, last time I checked, that's now almost 30 years. And so, they just abused their customer. Is their share of PC operating systems much lower than it was then? No. But that's not the right measure of share. The right measure of share in my view in that industry is your share of minutes spent staring at a smart screen. That's what the share of operating systems that you should care about. And so, what kind of smart screens do people now stare at most? Most? And what other one do a lot of people stare at who really like them? Pads. And so, if you added up all those and said, what do you think... So, what's their share of smartphone operating systems? Microsoft?

(01:12:55):
Last time I checked it was 0.4 of 1%. Yeah, so effectively zero. How about pads? Apparently it's 4% there. So, their share of people staring at a smart screen has plummeted. Plummeted. Why? Because water finds its own level. People said, there are these other ways of getting around this, and I'm going to take those ways. And I think the degree to which people use their smartphone for more things, as the function of that smartphone is advanced so much faster than your PC operating system, because more people are using it. So, that's what I'd say to Google. I don't care how painful it is, water flows downhill, the tide comes in, and you cannot stop that, even if you're one of the most powerful three firms on the face of the planet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
And it may take time, but eventually the customer tide pulls, that's a, I think that's really important.

Roger Martin (01:14:04):
But yeah, start now. If you don't start now, it's too late.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:11):
Yeah. I want to end with one very tactical question for people, that may feel overwhelmed, they're just like, oh my God, I don't know what we're going to do, this is so hard, all strategy stuff. You have this really cool idea called betterment, I think you wrote a media post about it, thinking betterment over perfection. And it gives you a first step of like, okay, here's a way to move forward. Can you just talk about that approach?

Roger Martin (01:14:32):
So, for me, strategy, this thing called strategy, with people, oh my God, oh my God, how am I going to do strategy? Whatever. I just think of it as a problem solving tool. And what problem should you attempt to solve? You should attempt to solve something where your current outcomes that you're getting are lower than the outcomes you wish you were getting. That's what I call a gap. There's a gap between those two. And you should just conceptualize it as, your current outcomes are a natural result of all the choices you've made interacting with the competitive environment. And so, you should reasonably assume that probably those outcomes aren't going to get a whole lot better, because they are the way they are for a good reason. So, you're going to need to make a different set of choices to make that gap go away. That's what I would work on.

(01:15:31):
I would just ask the question, what is the single most painful gap currently that I'm facing? Customers used to do this, and they're doing this, I can't find this kind of resources, our distribution channel has abandoned us... Whatever is the most painful thing, and then just tackle that. And say, what different choices could I make? And I'd say, use my cascade. Could I change where I'm playing? Could I change how I'm winning? Could I change my capabilities? Could I change my manage systems, in order to achieve a different aspiration? And so, don't try to solve the problems of the world, or even all the problems of your company, that's perfection. Betterment is making that gap go away. And guess what happens if you make that gap go away? You can turn your attention to the next gap, and the next gap, and the next gap.

(01:16:28):
And if you do that all the time, you're always working on the next gap, the next... They'll get smaller and smaller over time. I don't know if this is a great analogy, but I was dean of a business school for 15 years, the guy who won the professor of the year award more times than anybody else, and did it sort of teaching tough courses, often executive MBA courses, and the like, had a simple formula for doing it. Which is, he taught second-year courses, and second-year courses happened to be 13 two hour lectures, or sessions, [inaudible 01:17:10] or another. He just polled the students on what they thought of each session as they went along, and regardless of the reason, regardless of anything else, simply chopped number 13 every year.

(01:17:26):
Because in some sense, it's the biggest gap, the gap between what the customers, students, wished for, and were getting. And he would just replace it with something. He would try something else, and replace it with that. And you'd say, and that gets you professor of the year every year? And the answer is yes, betterment. Because if you're teaching for 25 years and you just keep doing that every year, every year, the course keeps getting better and better and better and better and better and better. So, betterment, it doesn't make purists feel awesome, but I'm not here to make purists feel awesome, I'm here to help people get better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):
This makes me think about your water metaphor too, of just water eventually finding a way through. [inaudible 01:18:26] iterating, [inaudible 01:18:27] things better.

Roger Martin (01:18:27):
Yeah, lots of what I think about in strategy is natural, if you will. I try to ask, how does the world generally operate, and is what we're doing consistent with the way the world generally operates or not?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:42):
Roger, this was so much fun, we covered everything I was hoping we'd get through. I think we're going to help a lot of people with the way they think about strategy. Is there anything else you wanted to just leave listeners with, or say before we wrap up and let you go? We covered a lot, so there may not be anything left.

Roger Martin (01:18:58):
Well, on strategy, there's one piece of advice I'd say. People often ask me about people who are natural strategists, or they say, I'm not naturally good at that, I'm more of an operational guy or gal. And what I tell them is, I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist. And they often throw back in my face, Lafley. They say, look, Lafley, he was known as a strategy genius. And I say, yeah, but when I interviewed him in depth about his background, for a paper I was writing, what I discovered was when he was in the Navy, as a whatever, I don't know, probably 25-year-old in the Navy, he had a job where he had to think about strategy, and was testing things out, and doing things, and the like. And then, I realized that he had been practicing strategy for decades before he became the CEO, decades.

(01:20:04):
And so, he just had more reps when he became CEO than almost anybody else that I've ever met. There's another guy, [inaudible 01:20:15], ex-CEO, now he's gone on to a higher level of Lego brand group, would be similar. So, great strategists that I have met have all one thing in common. They just practice. And anybody, there's no such thing as a person who is willing to practice strategy, who will end up saying, I'm operational, I don't do strategy well. Which links to our last thing about betterment. Just work on making different choices to solve problems. Not problems that I say, I'm not going to define your gap, it's one that you feel in your heart, I wish this were better. Work on it, if you do that, you'll be a great strategist. So, be encouraged, don't be discouraged. And the worst thing to do is to wait. People say, well, I've got all these operational concerns right now, and then I'll get to strategy later. You'll never amount to anything. Nobody who says that ever amounts to anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:22):
Wow. I love this, I love how empowering it is, I love the real talk. Roger, you're awesome. Thank you so much for being here.

Roger Martin (01:21:29):
You're most welcome. Thank you for making it a fun journey for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):
I learned a ton, and that's always a good sign, and it was a lot of fun.

Roger Martin (01:21:35):
Well-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:35):
Thanks, Roger.

Roger Martin (01:21:36):
Good.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Ryan: I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling, but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry. Um, being a CEO or founder makes it slightly harder, uh, in some ways, because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this space of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You also don't want to subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be a 100% transparent. 
[00:00:28] Lenny: Ryan Hoover is the founder of Product Hunt, which you already know. He's also former product manager, which I did not know. Currently, he's a full-time investor with his fund, the Weekend Fund. He's also an author of a bunch of great block posts and an actual book, called Hooked. He's also really good on Twitter and in my opinion, a very special human being. Ryan Hoover, welcome to the podcast.
[00:00:52] Ryan: Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I've been reading a lot of your blog posts over, I don't know, past two or three years now, and I'm glad to- to see you do the podcast now. It's cool.
[00:01:01] Lenny: Thank you, man. That compliment will go straight to my heart. And I will think about it often. I appreciate that. 
[00:01:07] Ryan: Cut- cut that and put it on Twitter. There you go. Yeah. [laughs]
[00:01:09] Lenny: [That's the clip, we're done. [laughs]
[00:01:10] Ryan: Yeah. Done, over. [laughs]

[00:02:12] Hey Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSB files from their customers?
[00:02:22] Ashley: At least 40%.
[00:02:23] Lenny: And how many of them screw that up? And what happens when they do?
[00:02:26] Ashley: Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CMC importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.
[00:02:43] Lenny: I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both sign-up conversion and increasing longterm retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.
[00:03:01] Ashley: Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and ZORA are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.
[00:03:17] Lenny: If you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.
[00:03:23] Lenny: You're such a tech celebrity; everybody knows Product Hunt. Everybody knows Ryan Hoover, at least in tech. And I'm curious, how often are you recognized walking around the street, in life, and has there ever been like a super awkward or super hilarious moment of that?
[00:03:37] Ryan: Yeah, so t- Product Hunt started in late 2013 and quickly got a lot of traction in- in the tech- tech sphere. So, yeah, people in tech, um, might recognize me. People outside of tech, doubt- doubt they recognized me. Um, I actually do wonder subconsciously if I grew my hair out to avoid being recognized. 
Um, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but anyway, it's been a couple years or so growing my hair out and I'm like, ah, I just kinda wanna like disappear sometimes. But, you know, in San Francisco, where everybody's in tech, um, there was a lot of that. And probably the- the, the moment where I was like, "Oh, this is- this is like a thing," uh, it was probably early Product Hunt, uh, I was at- do you remember... I don't know if you know this. Do you know a club, um, called DNA Lounge, and they did something-
[00:04:19] Lenny: Mm-hmm.
[00:04:20] Ryan: ... Called Bootie every Saturday-
[00:04:20] Lenny: Mm-hmm.
[00:04:21] Ryan: ... It was like a mash-up dance party.
[00:04:22] Lenny: Yeah.
[00:04:23] Ryan: Yeah. Super well known in the Bay Area. Really fun, fun, uh, kind of experience. Anyway, I remember being with friends and drinking, like- like one does and somebody turns around and says, “Is that the Product Hunt guy?” 
[00:04:33] Lenny: [laughs]
[00:04:33] Ryan: And that was the first time that sort of happened in that setting where I was like, oh gosh, now I have to like, think about my actions. And I can't just like, be entirely like loose and, you know, relax with my friends. And, um, so anyway, there- there's always pros and cons to those types of things. Um, but you know, it- it definitely is makes me more aware of, I'm already a very, like sometimes anxious and like self-aware person in terms of like my surroundings.
And so when you combine that with, “Oh, these strangers might be watching me,” is not the best thing in the world, but it's okay.
[00:05:04] Lenny: I've actually gone a little bit through that same experience recently in my, like a much smaller sense where I- with this newsletter and the growth of this thing, there’s been like meetups happening all over the world. And so I've been going to the SF meetups here and there, and it feels very strange to be like, known and people get- they’re like taken pictures with me, like what the- what the hell's going on.
‘Cause I started this thing as, uh, COVID hit and it was like- everyone's at home, I was just typing on my computer, didn’t have to go anywhere. And as the world has emerged, it's become a new- a new thing I'm dealing with, on a much smaller scale.
[00:05:35] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Events are events are fun. Um, we threw a bunch of them at- at Product Hunt. Uh, yeah, you- you do a lot of selfies and a lot of like, handshakes and it’s- there's, there's some energy there. I'm an introvert though. So by hour, like three or four, I'm just like, ugh… uh… I need to use the restroom cause I haven't been able to escape and I'm socially exhausted, so, but they are fun.
[00:05:55] Lenny: I know, uh, exactly what you mean. I am also an introvert and I get so drained doing things like that. I was gonna ask you about that. So yeah. Um, along the same lines, you’re- you're a very public person. You tweet a lot, you share a lot, you do a lot of podcasts and things like that. What's something that people don't know about you?
[00:06:12] Ryan: Yeah. Um, you're right. I- I probably sh- maybe overshare, uh, on Twitter and other things…
[00:06:17] Lenny: No, that, that is not what-
[00:06:18] Ryan: Um, there is a list of [laughs] no, no, I know. I know what you're saying. Um, but there's also a whole series of things that I don't talk about. Um, some of them- well, anyway, I won't, I won't talk about the things I can't talk about.
Uh, but one thing that, um, one thing that most people don't know about- I know there- there's certain juicy things, uh, like everybody has in their life. Um, I recently moved to- well, I guess it's been a year. Um, I moved to Miami about a year ago and, uh, I haven't been talking about it publicly, primarily because I just didn't want to be lumped into, oh, another person moving to Miami.
Like, I, I don't know. I just, there's no benefit or like, reason for me to do so. Uh, I want my friends there in Miami to know I'm there, but otherwise I don't need the world to know. I guess now they will. Um, that said in Miami, you know, we’re- we're there about two thirds of the year, so I'm actually in California right now.
Um, as you know, the summer humidity come- comes through Miami and hurricane season. We’re- we're planning to do more of, um- I wouldn't call it nomadic and I wouldn't call it bicoastal per se, but something like that. Where two thirds of the year we’re Miami and then maybe a third were in New York, or LA, or someplace else.
Um, and I love that. Um, fortunately we have the flexibility, uh, when I say we, my girlfriend, Susie, and I, to just carry our laptops and work anywhere. So it's been- it's been a nice lifestyle kinda shift.
[00:07:33] Lenny: I did not know that, that is very interesting. Why did you get pulled into Miami? What pulls you there?
[00:07:39] Ryan: Yeah. You know? Um, so the way I describe ci- cities are kinda like a product. So if you're in the supermarket or- supermarket, I sound like an, old- old person. Ha, if- if you're at a store, you're looking at different products, or if you're online, you're evaluating different products, and they each have like a cost and they have some benefits, um, or values or whatever you- you want to use to describe it.
And for me, each city is kind of like that. And so, you know, in terms of costs, there's cost of living in terms of housing, uh, food, taxes, a bunch of things that go into the cost of living in the city. And then the city provides a lot of benefits and- and things like that. And so in LA- so I was in bay area for ten years, LA for two Miami for one.
Now, they each have their own pros and cons. They each cost effectively different prices. And so we visited Miami a year and a half ago and we just fell in love with lot- lots of it. Um, we also- it's just cheaper. It's cheaper than the Bay Area. It's cheaper than LA. Um, when- when you kind of count, kinda like all in costs, um, and we had a bunch of friends move there, so we enjoyed the city.
We're like, this is good., strong ROI. Uh, this is a good product. Let’s- let's move there. Um, but at the same time, as I mentioned, like- we are traveling and, and exploring other cities. So it’s- it's kind of the best of both worlds for us.
[00:08:53] Lenny: Very cool. Um, curious how long you last there and how you like it over time. I love Miami. I always have a good time when I go there. And I have many friends living there. Changing topics, a little bit, something that I've noticed you do recently, which is super cool is you offer people the chance to DM you questions that they have about their startup or their journey as a founder.
And you just offer to give 'em free advice. And then sometimes you, tweet the DMs to share that with more folks. I'm curious just how many people have DM’d you because this is such a cool offer, and what have you learned going through this and kind of hearing people's questions?
[00:09:26] Ryan: I first opened up my DMs- I had 'em closed, which is like traditionally the default on Twitter for a long time. ‘Cause I was like, “Oh, if I open them up, I'll just get a bunch of spam and I don't need another inbox to- to call through.” I opened it up quietly and, um, actually didn't get a lot of spam, uh, surprisingly. Like yeah, people would shill something or promote something, but it wasn't too bad.
So I- I left it open and then I forget, one day I was maybe I was like- on the elliptical, bike or the recumbent bike or something. And I was just… I- I tend to get on the bike and just hold my phone up and just do emails and work. And so, um, I just said, “Hey, DM me if you have any questions, any founders, and I'll try and like answer as many as I can.”
And, um, part of my motivation for that was… I don't know, I was just killing time. And the other was, I used to blog a lot. I used to write a lot, um, I don't know, I've written hundreds of blog posts, but not so much anymore. I rarely write anymore. And part of it's because it just takes so long to write.
And sometimes I don't feel like inspired by any topic. It’s- it's sort of like a writer's block. And so I found this also kind of as a means to like, do micro- almost like micro blog posts in a way, uh, where the prompt is the question from somebody else. I don't have to think about the pr- prompt. And then the answer is- is in some ways, a way for me to actually think about that- that topic, almost like refine my own thinking in, in some sense.
And so I started doing that and then I realized, “Well, maybe other people have similar questions, and maybe other people have other answers and other ideas too,” so I would just take a screenshot of my answer and kind of summarize their answer, of course, keeping it anonymous, not sharing anything that would be sensitive. Um, and just put it on Twitter and- you know, it's been fun.
I do that maybe once every three or four days, I share a new question and answer and, sort of like a… It's like micro blogging in a way, I guess that’s what Twitter is, but like it's a kind of like a real micro-blogging kind of like, uh, um, activity for me.
[00:11:15] Lenny: Is there anything that's kind of surprised you, or that you've learned from founders? What they ask you about? Like, “Wow, I didn't expect this was gonna be such a common problem or question.”
[00:11:24] Ryan: I wouldn't say anything like super surprising. However, a lot of people… So, you could do the same thing on Twitter and say, “Hey, AMA, ask me anything in public,” the thing is people are not gonna ask certain things, um, for a lot of reasons. And maybe the biggest surprise was a lot of people are pretty vulnerable.
These are strangers, founders who DM me saying, “Hey, I’m- we have three months runway left. We’re running out of money. Here's a situation. What advice do you have?” Or just things that, you know, everyone has to wear this unfortunate mask is kind of the way I- what I used to describe it. This mask in life, in business, where everything is going great.
And you know, you're super confident, there are no problems. You got it all under control. And so the reality is that's not the case. Like [laughs] if you peered inside of almost every single company, it probably looks chaotic in- in different ways. And so I guess- I guess maybe the biggest surprise or thing that I value the most is the authenticity of people willing to share some of these, um, vulnerable moments and questions.
[00:12:17] Lenny: Awesome. What's interesting about your format is as you were talking, I kind of realized it's very similar to my newsletter format, which I- which I think is part of the reason it worked is it's based on people asking me a question, and then I answer the question, and then-
[00:12:28] Ryan: It's true. 
[00:12:29] Lenny: … And that ends up forcing you to have like concrete, actionable advice.
So you've kind of developed even more interesting way of doing it on Twitter, where it's more focused. So, very smart.
[00:12:39] Ryan: I've always liked your format by the way, in that you are, um- you're a curator in many sense. Like- yeah, you have a lot of experience and good ideas, but you're not trying to answer all the questions in that you are really pulling in experts in their domain expertise to like find answers or inspiration.
And I've always liked that format because one; it, I think leads to a better- better results, better content, better answers, but also it's arguably easier. Um, like imagine if- if you tried to like write, well, you you're shaking your head almost like it’s-
[00:13:10] Lenny: Like if I had the answers, I'd be like, “Oh, here you go. I'm done.” You know, the research takes a lot of work and time, but- but I do agree. It ends up being a lot more useful and, and- and valuable. And the reason I did that, just to kind of explain that briefly, is when I left Airbnb, people kept coming to me and asking me like, “Hey, how did Airbnb do this thing?
How'd they do that thing.” And I was just like- like, they, they don't know what they're doing. They just did this thing, and who knows if that was the thing that helped them, or if that was the right way of approaching it. So I wanted to do this, like, “What does everyone do? And what seems to be the pattern of the things that work?” And that kind of led to this approach.
And it takes a lot of time. Especially this new series that we're gonna chat a bit about that I worked on where it's just like endless interviews and chats and researchers and watching interviews. But yeah, it works out.
[00:13:54] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. You- you, how many hours actually, do you put into like a typical essay?
[00:13:59] Lenny: Oh, a reverse question. Uh, I would say the- 
[00:14:02] Ryan: Yeah, I don’t know if I'm supposed to ask you questions, [laughs] but I'm curious.
[00:14:04] Lenny: This is banned. [laughs] No, it's cool. I say- I'd say the, uh, median post is about 10 hours. It's like, maybe I kind of work on it through the week. So maybe, like a few days through the week, but the most epic posts take hundreds and hundreds of hours that I kind of work on behind the scenes as I work on the weekly posts.
So there's a wide range. Some posts take like three hours and sometimes those do very well, much better than expected.
[00:14:30] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. I- that's exactly going back to my, my point about like- it takes a long time to write content that you're proud of. Um, I’m also just very particular about words, uh, for better or worse. And so I- the first draft actually is maybe like 20 or 30% of the time. And then the rest is refining it and getting feedback and everything else.
[00:14:48] Lenny: That's exactly how I find it. The question I wanted to ask is, startups are so freaking hard… they almost always fail. It's always just like, “Oh my God, this is… Why am I doing this to myself?? My general advice to founders is like, don't start a company, unless you just like, can't not start a company because it's so hard.
What's your take there? What do you think? What do you advise founders for when they're thinking about, should I start a company? Should I not start a company? Which- how should I approach this?
[00:15:15] Ryan: I do- I do spend time, ironically, like. challenging founders sometimes when they're thinking about raising or thinking about an idea to- to not raise. Um, people who are in tech, uh, especially, are certain bubbles [laughs] of tech, that’s the default. It's like, “The first thing I do, I have an idea, now let's go raise money.” 
And we've gone through some like pretty massive bull cycles where that- that was possible for a lot of people. But it's a huge decision. So with- with Product Hunt, it was a side project in the beginning. It wasn't actually intended to be a startup at all, but in the beginning, you know, it was a newsletter, then it was a website and it was about four to five months before we even incorporated.And we got a lot of traction. 
So, it was during that time, I was really just thoughtful around, "Should we raise? Do I wanna work on this for many, many years? What's the opportunity? Is this even a venture backable like idea?" Like all those questions were circulating in my mind for a while. And this is also in a time when the market was pretty, was similarly bullish. This is, uh, end of 2013, early 2014. And investors were- were using Product Hunt to reach out to me, and they were sort courting- courting me, and um, kinda doing that whole song and dance to invest, but I- I just wasn't sure if I wanted to. And so, I don't know, I think a lot of the- those decisions, they're very personal and contextual. However, I think it's super important that founders see a line of sight to work on this for ... I think my rule of thumb is a decade, just do you see yourself working on this for a decade?
And maybe it's not a decade that you actually work on it. It probably won’t, it either, it'll probably fail before then as most startups do, but I think it's a good litmus test for yourself to be like, “Do I actually care about this enough? Am I, am I really stoked to work on this for many, many years?” But then, you know, the other thing is, I think a lot of people also think “I need to start a company. I need to start a startup.” 
And they skip to that step without just tinkering and building and, you know, Product Hunt, we called it, not even a side project, we called it an experiment. And that framing I think, is for me, has always been helpful because it's an experiment is really not about success. Of course you want it to be successful, but the goal is not success.
I put that in quotes, it's really to learn and, you know, see if people want this thing and then kind of adapt. And so like an experimental mindset is helpful and I think a valuable way to start. It even goes back to like, why I named the fund Weekend Fund. It's like, what are you tinkering with on the weekends?
You know? And how can you be more curious and experimental and kind of your exploration of new startup ideas?
[00:17:43] Lenny: I didn't know that's why it was called the Weekend Fund. I thought it's because you worked on it on the weekends, or is it both?
[00:17:48] Ryan: [laughs] It had like multiple meetings. Yeah, it was- three meanings: One was- was that I started Weekend Fund when I was building Product Hunt. So it took a lot of pitch- pitches and calls with founders on the weekends. Two, I think a lot of great ideas start by like metaphorically speaking, nights and weekends, um, kind of side projects or ideation.
And then the third reason was it was like more friendly. I don't know, I didn't wanna name it. Hoover capital or something like sterile, wanted it to be -
[00:18:14] Lenny: Wait, that's an awesome name. Hoover capital. Wow. 
[00:18:18] Ryan: …Capital. Uh I don't know. I, I feel well.
[00:18:23] Lenny: Yeah, it's not on brand,
[00:18:24] Ryan: Yeah. 
[00:18:25] Lenny: But it’s powerful- 
[00:18:25] Ryan: Um, yeah. [laughs] 
[00:18:28] Lenny: As you know, I asked people on Twitter what questions they would want to ask you. And so I'm gonna inter splice these questions as we go through this. And, you just touched on Product Hunt and fundraising, and I'm curious if you were to go back and- and do it again.
Would you raise money for Product Hunt, or would you not?
[00:18:44] Ryan: Great question. So at the time, this is also the thing I ask [laughs] founders is why do you need to raise money? Like, what is it for? Surprisingly, some people like- I don't know, like they don't have a clear answer. For me, It was pretty obvious. Like we needed- we needed to hire, we needed people. Like, I- I didn't have personal capital to- to pay people.
There was an alternative, uh, reality where we actually built an open source. I was thinking like, “Is that possible?” Like we're building something for the tech community. I'm sure a lot of people would love to work on this. Could we build it in an open source way, but that like- that's really hard to do.
And when you're building a company, you probably don't want to innovate on too many things, um, including like essentially how to build a product and build a team. Anyway, to answer your question, if I- I don't, I don't know what the right at the time raising money was the right decision because I- I wanted to hire and I didn't have personal capital.
There really weren't any other realistic options. I don't think. Today I could get further with my own- I'm not super wealthy and I'm super illiquid, but I have at least enough money where I could have funded, you know, maybe a year of development with this very small team. So today it might be a little bit different in which I might not raise venture capital because Product Hunt isn't the type of company that needs to raise a ton of money.
It's also one which is not, um, doesn't have like direct competitors in the sense of like an Uber and Lyft situation where raising is actually like kind of mandatory and you sort of have to build a massive war chest to compete. So there- there is a scenario where if I had more money, then maybe I wouldn't have raised venture capital. But yeah… there- there's a lot of other like decisions and other things that probably, uh, bigger mistakes I think I made. Um, not that raising money was a mistake by any means. It was, I think the right decision then, but yeah- there's a lot of learnings in hindsight's 2020.
[00:20:31] Lenny: The point you made about like, you just needed money to like run the thing. I think that's so, so overlooked when people bash the idea of fundraising for a startup that maybe didn't need it. Like you just need money. Like you don't have just money to burn and go into debt. That makes sense to raise some money and see where this thing goes without really knowing where it's gonna go.
[00:20:49] Ryan: Mm-hmm .Yeah, especially if it’s… I mean, I think it's very important to raise- raise from people who are aligned with you too. Meaning like, “Why does this person want to, whether it's an angel or a fund, invest in your fund?” Um, sorry, not fund… your company. When you go down a certain path, when you raise a series A, B, C, like you have different expectations and when you raise your proceed or seed round. So I think also understanding like, you know, what you're signing up for is super important.
[00:21:16] Lenny: What kind of treadmill you’re- you're getting on.
[00:21:18] Ryan: Yes. Yeah. ‘Cause you can't get off. I mean you can, but it's not like a company… I always say like when you're at a company, you can put in two weeks, notice one month notice. You can move on. As- as a founder or CEO, you can’t. Like, you really can't. Um, now you technically can… But you can’t, it- it's really, hard, um, to, to exit. 
[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. I look at the Airbnb founders. Who've been doing this for 15 years. Like, you know, they're doing well in life, but they also… it's very hard to leave.
[00:21:46] Ryan: Mm-hmm.
[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. Coming back to Product Hunt, people launch their product on Product Hunt, that's the thing, and I'm curious; founders are always so obsessed with launching and the power of a launch, and "We gotta launch.” Do you think launches are worth it for a company? Is that something founders should be spending time on or is it often better just to not even spend time on that and just build slowly?
[00:22:07] Ryan: Yeah, I- I always kinda ... Whenever I share like my perspective on stuff, I- I always enforce it always like it kinda depends, which is kinda like it sounds like a cop-out answer. So, it's- it's more ... My answers are usually more nuanced, and the thing about launching is- is going back to why are you raising money. What's the goal? Same thing. Why are you launching? And the the- a lot of people default to things like customer acquisition, "Oh, I wanna acquire customers." But sometimes that's actually not- it's not useful. Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch.
So, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership. So, as you launch, you might also encounter more partnerships, more opportunities. I think there's a serendipitous effect of launching. So, I think understanding like what are the priorities of the business. Like if you- it might not be customer acquisition at all, it might be, "We need to recruit and hire. Let's launch, so we can get the word out. Hopefully that will help land, you know, our next, you know, engineers, designers, or whoever." 
And then I also see there's like these little ti- side benefits too of launching that we see a lot through Product Hunt. One of them is team morale. And this- this might- I think this is overlooked. And I- I would also encourage [laughs] founders not to get their team too, um, I would say- you- you shouldn't be motivated to launch a product just to get like the likes on Twitter and the upvotes on Product Hunt, but there is a gr- like a powerful team morale and kinda building moment there where you can all celebrate what you've accomplished and what you built and put it out to the world. And, you know, somebody on the team can share, you know, the- the- the Product Hunt launch or, you know, some Tech Crunch article with their- their mom. And, you know, like that seems like a trivial kind of meaningless thing, but it actually matters for a lot of people. And then the other thing is SEO. So, if SEO's like a part of your strategy, having articles, positive articles, having a- a positive Product Hunt launch, things like that can also be helpful.
[00:24:21] Lenny: That's awesome. I love that last point about morale. I- I hadn't thought about that. You've seen probably more launches than other person out there. How many launches of startups would you estimate you've kind of like seen or been [laughs], I don't know, an observer of? If that makes any sense. 
[00:24:38] Ryan: Um, I should look at our database on Product Hunt and see how many launches we've had 'cause it's gonna be a subset of that. I mean by seen, I- I- some of it's very high-level, but tens of thousands over the years.
[00:24:48] Lenny: Okay, so when you think about that, do you have any sense of what correlates with a great launch versus just like an okay launch? What- what do founders miss with how they launch?
[00:25:01] Ryan: Yeah, I mean the- this goes back to college and- and the a- you know, I won't go on my own rant about education, but in, uh, you know, English class and writing class, a lot of teachers teach people to write with big words and fill pages of content and basically not speak like a human. And so, one- one thing I've noticed among founders and just people in general is they tend to write like a- a PR person and not like a human and not like, you know, the- the way that I kind of describe kind of a frame of- of writing, maybe your tagline for Product Hunt, um, or for your launch in general is like how- how do your customers or your users describe your product to other people? Or another frame is how do you describe it to your friends? Like when you're just, you know, hanging out, like how do you describe what you do, what you built, what it's for? And that language, I think, resonates with people because it feels way more authentic.
And the people that use buzzwords and- and vague language, it just doesn't click. People see right- people are sick of the PR [laughs] speech. And so, I think the language and the microcopy, copyrighting matters so much. And then there's a lot of other things around like we should go more to the product and less about the launch. Like do you really understand who you're building for? And do you understand how to communicate the value prop- like what is it in the mind of user? There's sort of a lot of, I guess, more strategic kinda like decisions that go into that- that, uh, before the launch.
[00:26:22] Lenny: Imagine each of those, uh, points can be its own podcast and block post. [laughs] One of the questions that people asked me on Twitter was the classic, "How do I get to number one on Product Hunt?" So, my question to you is I know that's like ... There's not gonna be a silver bullet. Is there like a guide that you point people to that's like, "Here, just follow this advice," and/or, I don't know, two or three key things that you just gotta get right.
[00:26:44] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, so in the posts below, there's actually a link- links to a bunch of guides and FAQs and things like that. So, it's really easy to find like sort of the best practices there. The team also has like this checklist. So, once you launch, there's like a checklist of things, recommendations or tips. And I'm actually forgetting like what each of them are specifically right now, but some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief. Some people write essays, which might be interesting, but the reality is most consumers, especially people on Product Hunt, you know, they're- they're flipping through a bunch of ideas. They're looking for things that spark their curiosity and interest.
And they probably not particularly interested in reading like an [laughs] essay, you know, from- from the makers. So, keeping that short, I think, is helpful. And then another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort. It could be like, "Here's the before and after with our product," or "Here's the evolution of what this product can do." There's many different ways to approach it, but like a really clean, you know, visually interesting story, um, can also be a great way to like capture people's interest in what you built.
[00:28:21] Lenny: Awesome. That was very tactical and helpful. If you were to launch something on Product Hunt yourself, and it wasn't like hunted by Ryan Hoover, do you think you would get to the top?
[00:28:30] Ryan: [laughs] I- I mean I don't know. It's- it's funny because if you ... We should do some like historical analysis on Product Hunt 'cause I'd be curious to know the actual numbers, but it varies all over the board. So, some people, they ask me, "Hey, like I don't know, is Product Hunt like ... Do B2B companies do well there?" And I'm like, "Yeah, like a lo- m- probably more B2B companies than B2C companies actually," and so you see, you know, seemingly boring companies that tap into something that- that- that people find useful or resonate- resonates with them, um, can go to the top. And then you also see the weird, wacky stuff, you know, the- the silly apps also hit the top. So, I don't know, it really varies.
And sometimes it's also driven by like the almost like the zeitgeist, like what do people find interesting right now? Like what's sparking people's interest? Because Product Hunt, on one side, you are potentially attracting people who might be future users and customers, partners, and so on, but it's also just a general kind of like zeitgeist of the early adopter tech community. Like what are they interested in? What do they find compelling in general?
[00:29:34] Lenny: Got it. Okay, so I have a bunch of questions from Twitter that people [laughs] wanted to ask you. And so, let me ask you a few of those, and they're kind of a little bit all over the place, but we'll see- we'll see where this goes. Jessica Toye, who's a- she's a PM at Angel List, she's actually a friend. We were together at Airbnb. She asked a great question.
[00:29:53] Ryan: Yeah. Jess- Jess is awesome. She- shout-out to Jess, she's like been super helpful on the Angel List side, so she's awesome.
[00:29:59] Lenny: Amazing. Okay, she's the best. She asked what you learned as a PM that has helped you in your venture career.
[00:30:06] Ryan: Yeah, um, yeah, so my- my background is, uh, marketing and then product management. Pretty quickly, uh, used to work in the gaming industry, which is like, I think, an- an awesome industry. Really hard to make it in that industry, but like amazing place to learn, and no, no, uh, I have so many biases, so I have to like be cautious of that, but I- I- having a product background, I think, is one of the most important aspects of early stage startup investing, meaning oftentimes, when you're building a new company, there are a lot of risks and there's a lot of important things to- to nail, but it all ultimately comes down to the product that you're building. And so, I think having a product management or a product background is helpful. And one, having more, I guess, perspective in evaluating different ideas and- and arguably more important, uh, how the founder thinks about things. So, it might be less about me evaluating the- the- the market need for this particular idea, but it's what's the thought process and how did this founder come to these product ideas and these insights. And so, I think having a product management background is helpful for that, and I don't know, I also just find it really fun to jam on product with founders. And when it's early, early days, there- there's more opportunity to create some sort of impact or, you know, help shape the product in- in a slight way.[00:31:20] 
Lenny: Awesome. Basically if you're a PM, you've got a lot of the skills that you need to be a founder.
[00:31:24] Ryan: Founder and- and arguably, investor, um, as well.
[00:31:27] Lenny: Oh, and that's right. Okay. So, uh, Leo of Sousa Ventures, who's also an awesome dude, uh, he asked if you could go back and-
[00:31:35] Ryan: I saw Leo in, uh, Miami, uh, not long ago.
[00:31:39] Lenny: Oh yeah. He moved to Miami too. Oh my God. Everyone's over there. Okay, so [laughs], uh, he asked if you could go back and build Product Hunt again, what would you do differently? We talked a bit about this, but anything else?
[00:31:50] Ryan: Yeah. Um, I've been thinking a lot about this actually lately. And, um, yeah, I mean there's a few things. Uh, one, Product Hunt, in the very beginning, and still today, is very much focused on tech, and there was, at one point, ambition to expand beyond tech into all different types of, you know, categories of products. So, you know, we experimented with podcasts actually, podcast discovery.
We experimented in video game discovery, we experimented with book discovery, and the thesis there was, "Okay, this could be actually discovery platform for all of these communities to discover all these different products," and I think there was a lot of good ideas in that. However, I severely underestimated how difficult it would be to do two things: one, the product experience on Product Hunt is very different than how you would wanna discover video games or maybe, in the future, fashion and a bunch of other types of products out there.
And two, it's really difficult to translate a community and expand into other communities. Like some- some have done it. Like Reddit is maybe a great example, where Reddit has this massive [laughs] long tail of, you know, every kinda community you can imagine, but very few companies and platforms can actually do that. So, that's one- one regret is we should not have tried to expand horizontally. We should've just focused entirely vertically and- and served the tech community, you know, better and- and with more things, which is effectively what we're doing now. Another regret, another thing I would've changed is I would've- I would've actually tried to monetize and generated revenue sooner. We- we raised a seed in a series A and we had capital to grow, and we didn't actually try to make money until after we required Angel List.
And my thinking at the time was, and to some extent, there's some truth to this, is like everything you prioritize is at the cost of something else. You know, you- you're essentially taking focus from one thing and directing it to something else. And what mattered most was growth and to grow the community, but what I really should've done is dedicated maybe 10% of our focus on revenue generation because, you know, it was- once we started generating revenue, we- we did so very quickly, and we go to cashflow, break even, I wanna say a year, maybe 12 months after we started generating revenue. So, if we would've started in 2014 to make some money, we coulda been cashflow, break even, you know, maybe 2015, 2016, which would've just given us a lot of flexibility in kind of owning your own destiny and proving out some of the business model itself. 
And then like the last thing, uh, I've been thinking about this lately is- is delegation is- is a classic founder challenge. You know, I- I'm just generally a controlling person. That's something I'm working on. And it's really hard sometimes when I have such strong opinions, and I'm very particular about certain things, uh, fully delegate and fully trust everybody. Not necessarily- we have an amazing team. Like I worked with some amazing people, still people that are Product Hunt today like six, seven years later. It wasn't anything about the skills of the team. It was just my own trust and my own delegation, and what I should've done is, you know, up until shortly before I left, I was editing the newsletter every morning, for example, like every morning. I was waking up, you know, 5 a.m., 5:30 a.m., editing the newsletter. I mean that's just kinda silly, you know, to be doing that so many years later after starting.
[00:35:02] Lenny: I totally get that drive to just make sure everything you're putting out and that your company's putting out is topnotch. I- I have the same feeling, and it is hard to [laughs] let go and just like, "That's not perfect, but I'm gonna- I'm gonna be okay with that, a few other things."
[00:35:16] Ryan: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's- it's really hard, and I think it's a tendency that is, uh, in some ways, it's- it's good in that you care so much about the product as a founder. You care so much about what you're building. You care so much about the details, uh, and you need that kind of like almost OCD-like, uh, behavior, however, you also just can't scale yourself nor are you the best person at everything. So, I- I don't know. With hindsight I'm like, "All right, I should've delegated more. I should've trusted people more." And yeah, they'll- there will be more mistakes. I make mistakes all the time, but at the end, it's gonna be way net positive because you kind of have to [inaudible 00:31:30] your company anyway.
[00:35:54] Lenny: It’s a good segue to a question Harry Stubbings asked that he finds interesting always. What's the most painful lesson that you've learned and, but that you're also happy about to have gone through?
[00:36:05] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there's ... I actually- I recently in the past couple weeks, wrote a blog post, that I'm not really able to publish 'cause it's- it's basically when you- there's certain things I wanna share that it- it- it can make things challenging and complicated for others. So, I didn't wanna put anyone else in- in a pickle. So, someday maybe I'll publish this post, but to speak more vaguely about it, like there's some hard- really hard times in Product Hunt, like we- we have all faced in- in different ways as founders, not even just as founders [laughs], just as people. Oh, yeah, there's some times where I felt physically ill, many different moments in- in Product Hunt. And um, it was just really tough, and you know, you- I don't know if- I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry.
Being a CEO or a founder makes it slightly harder in some ways because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this face of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You- you also don't wanna subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be 100% transparent. So, it's- it's a struggle because, I think, I h- I don't know, I value authenticity so much, and I- I kinda like thrive around people who are authentic, however, there's this like tension with- with being a founder or CEO where you can necessarily share everything. So, anyway, everyone's gone through hardship building a company. You know, the positive aspect of that is like if- I- I think, hopefully growing some empathy for founders who are going through hard situations. I think it's made me a little bit stronger, maybe thicker-skinned for certain things. It just provided more- more perspective, you know, into the company kind of like building journey.

[00:38:29] Lenny: We talked about how hard startups are and how many people should not start a company, but at the same time, part of this question, which I think you would agree with, is you're probably very happy you went through all that and- and wouldn't change, wouldn't like undo that, right?
[00:38:43] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of y- y- like a lot of things, you know, uh, what doesn't break you makes you stronger to some extent. So, it didn't break me, uh, it just scarred me a little bit but didn't break me. [laughs]
[00:38:52] Lenny: And turned you into the Ryan Hoover that we- that we have today.
[00:38:55] Ryan: Yeah. For better or worse.
[00:38:57] Lenny: [laughs] Maybe one last question from- from Twitter, Twitteratis. From Sandeep. He just wanted to know what- what have you found matters most to you or mattered most to you in life and in business versus what you thought would matter most?
[00:39:09] Ryan: Yeah, um, still figuring it out. I'm- I'm- I'm still asking the- the old stereotypical questions like, "What- what the heck is the meaning of life? Like what am I here for?" [laughs] All those things.
[00:39:19] Lenny: Let me know when you figured it out. 
[00:39:20] Ryan: Yeah. And maybe, maybe there is no answer. Maybe the question is, is actually, um, doesn't matter. So I mean, if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out.
Yeah. And maybe- maybe there is no answer. Um, maybe the question is- is actually it doesn't matter. Um, so I mean if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out. I mean I think in- in life, some of the things that I've reflected on is, uh, so damn cliché, but sometimes when cliches are true is like friends and authentic relationships have been, I don't know, they just matter so much, I think. And the older I get too, it's less about, I don't know, I care less about having a lot of friends and more about a few deep, close relationships. And I don't know, I feel like that's very different than like middle school Ryan or like, you know, when you're in- on the playground metaphorically speaking, like where everyone's tryin' to be popular and, you know, meet a lot of people. And even- even joining and- and being, you know, uh, in San Francisco in the tech community, you wanna meet a lot of people and network and all- do all those things, that- that's less interesting to me and less important.
And then, more on the business side, the thing I've been thinking about is like, and I think this is obvious to a lot of people, but I think there's some nuances to it, which is momentum matters so much. And momentum is reflexive in that, you know, high momentum leads to more high momentum. Low momentum leads to more low momentum because there's this energy that- that kinda goes through companies where, when there is momentum, when people are shipping, when things are going well, other people feel that energy, and they wanna do the same, but in the reverse, someone who might be slowing things down, not shipping, not really performing very well, that actually does the reverse too. It- it might lead other people to- to feel less motivated or care less. And so, I don't know, momentum is- is this weird thing that, you know, you- arguably, it's one of the most important things in early-stage startups. And of course, it's an- an input to a lot of things, uh, but it's just so important to nail.
[00:41:00] Lenny: Mark Andreessen talks about that- that last point that ... There's like a word for it that I forget, that a company is either becoming a gravity and pulling in all resources and funding and attention or losing it. And it's really important as a company to know which one of those are you, and as an investor, you often wanna bet on the company that's just like they're just becoming the center of gravity here, and there's not a lot you can do to change that once they reach a certain point.
[00:41:24] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean the- it also mirrors with like the power law of investing where it's- it's, in most people's situation, it's one company is returning ... You can invest in 100 companies, and one of those companies is probably gonna return three to five X in the returns of all the others, maybe combined in some cases. So, it's- it's wild.
[00:41:45] Lenny: On the first point that you made earlier about cliches and platitudes, it reminds me, Michael Pollan has this point that he makes that like cliches and platitudes are cliches and platitudes because we've heard 'em so many times but that- because they're true. People just say 'em because they're so true. And as much as we don't wanna hear them, like there's a reason that we hear them again and again. Uh, I had a similar recognition when I was on a little psychedelic journey where I'm just like, "Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need, man.”
[00:42:15] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah.
[00:42:16] Lenny: Okay, people have figured that out. But I was like, I feel that, I feel that right now. But it's true. That's why people- that's why f- [laughs] we're like, "Okay, shut up. I heard that. That's in a song."
[00:42:25] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah, it's- I was listening to- to a podcast, uh, about someone who was basically describing like psychedelics as a gateway into like meditation and- and everything and how it can be one of those things that makes people ... It- it- a lot of people who take psychedelics come across as another hippie cliché like person who like repeats the same things we've all heard many, many times, but there's a reason why there's a pattern there. And, you know, he describes like psychedelics as- as one way to feel that and learn that- that feeling that you can't achieve with- with meditation, you know, with experience.
[00:42:56] Lenny: Yeah, I think Sam Harris talks about this where you could either meditate for five, 10 years to work your way up the mountain towards, you know, enlightenment, or you could just take some psychedelics, visit it for a little moment, see what it's like, and then [laughs]- and then-
[00:43:09] Ryan: Mm-hmm.
[00:43:09] Lenny: be motivated to, to work on getting there more naturally
[00:43:12] Ryan: Yeah.
[00:43:13] Lenny: This is a good time to play a little game that I invented just for you. Okay, so you're the founder of Product Hunt. Okay. And, on Product Hunt, people up vote ideas that they like best. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you two options and you tell me which you'd rather— which you'd up vote and it'll make sense once we get going. [laughs]
That sound good.
[00:43:33] Ryan: Okay, cool. Let's do it.
[00:43:35] Lenny: Okay. TikTok or Instagram Reels?
[00:43:38] Ryan: And, and is context setting, are these within the context of products? I, I like and know, or
[00:43:43] Lenny: Products you would choose to use that you like better... yeah. Not like which will do business— better business. Yeah. 
[00:43:50] Ryan: Okay. Okay. Got it. TikTok's for me. It's funny, reels, I kind of joke with, with Susie, my girlfriend, I joke that it's like, reels is like, TikTok, but like two weeks late.
Uh, it's not entirely true, but I feel like I see a lot of TikTok videos on Instagram reels. Like after, you know, weeks after they've been published.
[00:44:08] Lenny: We'll see, I have some friends that work on reels and I'm excited to see where they go. Okay, next- LaCroix or Topo Chico.
[00:44:15] Ryan: Ooh, this is a tough because I- I- I'm generally a La Croix kinda person, but Topo Chico, I like the bottle. So, when Topo Chico's available, I'll go Topo Chico. I'm sorry, La Croix.
[00:44:26] Lenny: [laughs] I- I totally get that. My wife's a huge Topo Chico fan. We have many, many [laughs] bottles. They're beautiful. They've- kind of changed a bit. They're like super clear now, they used to have a little, a little tint.
[00:44:36] Ryan: Hmm. 
[00:44:37] Lenny: Very important topics. Yeah. Okay. Next, next up, Bay Area or Los Angeles?
[00:44:43] Ryan: Uh, Los Angeles. Although, it depends on the- the, so here's my goals, if- if I was, you know, a new college grad or someone young and- and new in kind of the tech industry, definitely San Francisco. You'll create a lot of serendipity. You'll- you'll meet a lot of people, but from a lifestyle perspective, LA. Um, LA, I just find more enjoyable, weather's better, there's hiking, housing is cheaper. So, LA today, San Francisco, 10 years ago.
[00:45:09] Lenny: Very nuanced dancer. I knew you were gonna say LA, and so, next is East Side LA or West Side LA?
[00:45:16] Ryan: I don't know. We- we lived in Hollywood up in the hills for a while. So, I don't know if that's East or West, but wherever that is, big fan.
[00:45:24] Lenny: I guess that's West, right? It's not near the water. That's a really good question. Hollywood Hills, all right, that'll be a third [laughs] option. Okay, electric bike or regular bike.
[00:45:34] Ryan: Nothing against electric bikes, but I feel like if- if your goal is to get exercise, then just get a regular bike, but I don't have either. I have a- a, um, recumbent bike at home that I use for exercise. The reason why it's recumbent and not like a Peloton where you sit up is 'cause I can do emails and work [laughs] because while I'm exercising.
[00:45:53] Lenny: Wow. Very productive. Okay. Next, dark mode or light mode?
[00:45:58] Ryan: Light mode, I've never used dark mode like ever. Actually I take that back. Tweet Deck is the only dark mode kind of app that I use. But- 
[00:46:06] Lenny: Wow. 
[00:46:07] Ryan: I don't know. If- if a founder is prioritizing dark mode before they have product market fit too, it's like a big red flag for me. That's a little bit of a hot take. Some people are gonna hate me for that, but I don't know. I don't think dark mode matters for like 99% of people.
[00:46:22] Lenny: Wow. Big, big, hot take. What if they just go dark [laughs] and there's no light mode. Does that count against them?
[00:46:28] Ryan: Uh, Yeah, that's fine. As long as it's just one mode, um, it's the teams that prioritize all these, like small things that don't matter before the product is actually like useful for people or, or that that's, that is where I like my product manager hat comes in and I'm like, is this like the highest on your priority list?
I don't know. Now big asterisks, it's all contextual. Sometimes. Like the audience you're building for really cares about dark mode. Like if you're building for developers, maybe you need dark mode, or, or some version of it, but, but yeah, I'm, I'm light mode.
[00:46:57] Lenny: Awesome. Okay. [laughs] Did not expect that, love it. Okay, two more. Wash the dish right away or let it soak in the sink?
[00:47:04] Ryan: [laughs] Um, I'm looking at the sink over here. There might be dishes in there, so that'll be my answer. I got a bad habit.
[00:47:11] Lenny: No, I think there's- there's power in letting it soak. I get it. I respect that.
[00:47:15] Ryan: [laughs] That’s what I'll tell Susie next time. There's power. Lenny said there's power in soaked dishes.
[00:47:20] Lenny: There's physics. It's soaking. Okay. Last one, Web3 or Web5?
[00:47:25] Ryan: Mm, uh, I don't know what happened to Web4, so I don't know, maybe- maybe we'll split the difference, so I'm gonna go Web4.
[00:47:31] Lenny: Okay. We did it. [laughs] That was the inaugural addition of which would you rather up vote? Amazing. You killed it.
[00:47:38] Ryan: There you go go. I like this. All right. It's kind of a fun, this could, this could be a fun little segment, I think for a lot of things.
[00:47:45] Lenny: Yeah. It'll plug Product Hunt. It'll be great. We'll see [laughs] where this goes. This replaced my lightning round, which I experiment with. Okay. But actually I have other questions I want to get through before we, before I let you go. If that's cool.
There's kinda two topics. One is around consumer startups and just a few things that I've been learning there and then angel investing and then- and then we wrap.
So around consumer. By the time this post comes out, I'll have released some portions of the series that I'm working on, on kickstarting and scaling consumer business. And there's a few things I've learned there that I just wanted to get your take on. One is that, and we talked a bit about this just like 99% of consumer apps seem to just like, not work, especially if they're venture scale, if they raise money, just like just a reminder of how hard consumer is like, when is the last consumer app that really took off.
And so I just wanted to get your thoughts— is what's your take there? What should founders do that are starting a consumer company?
[00:48:40] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's tough. I mean there's- there's obviously consumer is pretty broad, so there's like different levels of difficulty, I think. Um, the consumer social or gaming, like games, building games, is probably like the- the- the hardest and the one filled with the most failures. And I think a lot of that is because, I think a few things, I think one monetization is generally harder than like a B2B company. Historically, a lot of it's been like advertising driven, and to do that, you have to first get to massive scale for advertisers to really care. And then you have to, you know, double it and double it and double it [laughs] again. So, monetization is super tough, versus a B2B company, it's like people have a problem, they have a need, they are willing to give you money, you know, on day- day one.
The other thing about consumer that's tough is you're- you're always fighting different, essentially you're fighting for attention. And so, you might be some consumer social company, but you're- you're kind of like competing with Netflix too, which isn't in your direct domain, but like people could be watching Netflix, or they could be using your product or- or your social app, let's say. So, now you're competing with so many different things. Many of those are incumbents where the consumer also has like built-in habits, routines. Like this is a big- big part about consumers too is eventually you wanna be like an internal trigger in someone's mind where they- they just, without even thinking, they go and use your product or services for some reason. Usually, you don't start that way. You need like external triggers to like pull people in, but eventually you have to get to that point. So, how do you overcome those internal triggers they have for other services, other products? It's really, really hard. 
And- and then I think a lot of it is, um, like B2B companies, usually you- you have a clear like problem that you're solving. And you could talk to customers, you could understand what are their current behaviors, what- what solutions are they using now, what do they like about them, what do they not like about them whereas, consumer, there's a little bit of that, but it's- it's fuzzier. You know, if you take, um, like Twitter and you kind of even ask someone like, "Why do you use Twitter and like w-" people will have different answers that are all kind of like fuzzy. And they ultimately tend to come down to some sort of like innate human desire. Like it could be, uh, for Twitter, it could be about like, "I wanna be informed with what's happening in the world," or it could be, "I want to feel less lonely or connected to more people," or something like that whereas, if you go to, let's say DocuSign, I think is a great example, of a B2B company, it's like super simple. [laughs] 
It's like a- a way to get legal docs signed online. That's- that's what it does. It's a thing that people have to do. It's very clear like what it solves. And so, B2B's just like easier to navigate that idea maze. And so, with consumer, you- your- your first blog post on this topic touches a lot on the idea side. And I- I, a lot of it resonated with me, especially the- the insight piece. Like what is- what is the insight that you, as a founder, have to build this thing? Because I think it's really hard to build a consumer company without some sort of unique insight, maybe impossible. And you can get that in many different ways. It could be through your own experiences. I used to write like a problem journal. Like just when things annoyed me or when things were like less efficient, I would write it down as like a note. And I didn't try to solve it. I didn't- didn't say, "Oh, here's the solution." I was just like, "This is annoying." 
Like, in San Francisco, one example is a lot of people don't have laundry like in their unit. So, I'm like, "That's kind of annoying. Like that's a problem. Maybe there's a solution out there." So, things like that. And I know, there's- there's- there's a bunch of different ways, like, uh, y- your- your blog post does a better summary, I think, of like the different ways different companies like ideated and came up with their ideas, but yeah, many different ways to navigate it but needs an insight of some sort.
[00:52:09] Lenny: Awesome. I hadn't heard that, u- u- uh, that pr- problem journal idea. I was gonna ask you if you have any suggestions for how to come up with a startup idea, and that's a really interesting one. Is there- yeah, so I guess it'd be cool to hear where that came from and what that led to? Or if there's anything else you found to be useful around that?
[00:52:23] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, the problem journal is one. And again, like I think it's helpful, not to try to come up with the solution, but just write- just simply write down the problem you- you observed or experienced. Another one I think's interesting is just to like immerse yourself in different communities. Ideally, like maybe like seemingly niche or weird long tail communities. It doesn't have to be that necessarily, but that might be where you'll see more unique insights or- or gather more insights, and you could do that through, I don't know, I'm just thinking subreddits, meeting a lot of people who are like really excited some other thing. It could be like some weird robotics like niche, hobbyist community, for example. And a lot of that, I think, will- will hone or just like create serendipity for ideas. You might see patterns, or you might see, you know, if problem statements emerge from many people in that community that are facing similar things.
And then there's like the other- other component too, which is really about like observing trends and- and changes, whether it's like a consumer behavior shift. Let's take an obvious one. Today is like distributed working. So, five- five years ago when the Weekend Fund started, that was one of our themes. It was like I- I- I think distributed working will be on the rise for a number of reasons. One, you know, i- it's harder and harder to recruit. Two, there's a subset of people who really valuable that flexibility and autonomy. And then fast forward, we had COVID, so like we had remote working, and- and now, that's a huge consumer behavior shift. Not just in how people work but also, like going to your Airbnb like world, like Airbnb has shifted their entire product to support more of this remote working kind of lifestyle, just the way that the- the homepage is now more of a catalog of places that you could explore at different times of the year versus Airbnb before was more like, "I have a very specific vacation trip that I wanna take during these days in these areas."
It's like a very different like browsing kind of experience. So, that's just one example. Consumer behavior shifts is one thing to observe. The other is technology shifts. So, what- what new thing can you build today that couldn't be built yesterday? And so, there's- there's a bunch of categories around there, like Web3, AI, you know. The biggest shift that we've seen is- is mobile in like early 2010s, um, 'ish, that unlocked a whole- whole bunch of things. So, so, yeah, I think it's observing those shifts and those changes. Last thing I'll say on that is like I think startups, since there are more and more people building companies and technology, there's essentially more efficiency. It's certainly not a- an efficient, super efficient market, but there is more efficiency in problem discovery and- and- and solution exploration. And so, for that reason, you need even more reasons for things to- sort of answers to the, "Why now?"
Like what's changed? What insight do you have? Why doesn't this exist already? 'Cause a bunch of people are trying to build something in the space most likely. Just a lot of what we think about, especially on the investing side, when we talk to founders.
[00:55:14] Lenny: Wow. There's s- way too much good advice there. Have you written this down anywhere? Is there a Tweet thread people can find like your kind of approach to coming up with an idea?
[00:55:22] Ryan: I have not, I don't think so. 
[00:55:24] Lenny: Cool. All right. Now we have to-
[00:55:26] Ryan: Blog post for the future.
[00:55:27] Lenny: Yeah. Or this is the, uh, this is the- the- the content for people to save and use. Thanks for sharing all that. That was really helpful. One other question I wanted to ask you along these lines is around the target audience and, uh, something ... A- an insight that we both share is that it's really important to get really narrow, whatever you focus on initially, as a start up, and it's, for founders, it's often so counterintuitive, they're like, you know, it's like, "Oh my god, why should I focus on the 1000 people? Or 10000 type people-
... Versus the millions that might wanna use this thing?" What's your sense, and where have you kind of seen that become important? Just the idea of getting very narrow of how you're going after.
[00:56:05] Ryan: Yeah, it's, effectively, the more narrow you're- you're generally, and this is where I throw in the big asterisks, like not for everything, there's always contextual differences, but generally, the easier it is to build a great solution for those people, because now you can actually hone in the product experience, the messaging, and everything to serve exactly those people. And it can help with the product side, it can help with the marketing and go-to market where you- you're messaging ... When people land on your homepage, you don't need to create kind of a broader kind of like value prop to everybody, but really, you can focus on like what is the- the problem this particular audience or community is- is facing. And so, generally, it's just easier.
Now there is always that challenge of like, "Well, is this too small? Is it too- too much of a niche if- if my goal is to build like a massive company?" My bias is not to worry too much about that because what you probably find is, over time, opportunities to expand beyond that. You'll see parallels, maybe to other communities or to other problems. And a lot of companies, you know, eventually expand well beyond that. Like I'll go back to Airbnb, you know the story way better than I do, but you know, initially, it was just like, you know, basically couches and extra rooms in houses. And like a lot of people, most people in the US would not do that. Like my parents, not- not in a million years. Even me, like I don't wanna like stay in some stranger's like room. I want my own space, my own house. So, that- that probably at the time seemed really niche and like small, but obviously, they extended- extended well beyond that.
Now- now I view Airbnb as like housing in generally speaking. Like their- their TM is housing in- in my mind, which they haven't yet exp- expanded into like real estate sales or like longterm rentals, per se, but like that- that's a possibility.
[00:57:51] Lenny: This is a good segue to the last topic I wanted to touch on, investing, which I believe you do full-time. Would you say that it's- your full-time gig now?
[00:57:59] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, I'm spending all my time there, and yeah.
[00:58:02] Lenny: Cool. So, from what I can tell, the Weekend Fund is killin' it. I'm not an LP, but it feels like it's kind of this underrated juggernaut that's just doing very well. And so, I wanted to ask you a couple questions along these lines. One is what have you learned about investing, angel investing? Especially what's most surprised you?
[00:58:20] Ryan: I mean I feel like there's a lot ... A lot we've learned. So, there's- there's things on the operational side. Like running a fund, there's a bunch of things that go into it, from LP communications, LP fundraising. There's also like ... Vedika who works with me on the fund side, she, um, she describes it as like hygiene. There's also good hygiene when it comes to running a fund. For example, you know, when you meet a founder, you- you- you should get back to them. [laughs] Like if it's a pass, you should let them know. And then there's a lot of different ways that you can do that. Some people, you know, might just say like "pass," and that's not very encouraging to a founder if they gave you no context, no details. There's also an element of hygiene, which is you always follow up with the person that introduced us to that company. And we just feel it's kinda like that's what we appreciate.

Like we like to kinda know what happened, like s- have them close the loop. And so, there's like good hygiene, operational things that we've learned and kinda honed over- over the years. I mean the biggest surprise, the biggest surprise has probably been ... I gotta be careful of how this is interpreted in some ways, but it's ... There are cases when I didn't think the company would make it. I- uh, either the product wasn't working, and you know, many months had passed, and it was very clear that they're- they- well, to me, I thought it was clear that, okay, that this probably isn't gonna work out. In my head I kinda wrote it off. And then that company either pivoted or- or some m- like massive partnership or MMA event came through out of nowhere, and so I- I guess the learning is like never count a portfolio company out until it's over.
And, you know, uh, that relies on, of course, backing founders that are very resilient and creative and- and, you know, driven to- to create momentum, you know, out of nothing, but- but that's been surprising to me. And it makes me kind of excited because, you know, we invested in over 110 companies now and it's- it's fun to be able to kinda see behind-the-scenes a little bit how all these things kind of play out, both the good and the bad.
[01:00:13] Lenny: That's such an inspiring takeaway. Does that change how you invest? Like to me, that's like, "All right, I guess I should just take more bets on founders that are awesome." Although, I find just founder bets, it's like a very expensive hobby/approach because there's so there's so many great founders. How is that informed how you invest seeing that happen?
[01:00:33] Ryan: I would say we don't, we don't have like, um, it's again, my cop out it's contextual kind of answer. Like, you know, some people are like, "We are a team first only." Some are, "We're market first." Some are, "We're product first." And we- we look at everything kind of holistically, and I think the evaluation of the product is- is sort of a reflection on the team. So, our- our assessment of the thinking behind the product that they built today and maybe some of the traction is a reflection on like the team's abilities and like the thought processes.
So, we try to look at it holistically in, um, I mean, yeah, I mean every investor would say like, "Yeah, we wanna back, you know, resilient founders that are very driven, insightful, and all those things," of course. But it's also sometimes hard to like fully evaluate that, unless you really know that person. So, so, we try to- to- to take as much data around like how the product is working and how they made those decisions leading up to this to- to evaluate the team sort of indirectly.
[01:01:26] Lenny: That's kinda what I've started to do is I- I try not to invest as a founder bet unless I just know them because it's just so hard otherwise.
[01:01:35] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there- there's a few founder bets that- that we've made. One, going back to the consumer social kind of thing, he's somebody I've known for many, many years. One of the most talented like designers, engineers, product builders. And I've just been waiting for him to start a company and- and so, that was- that was one of those, "I'm gonna bet on you because I believe in you. I'm not sure about this first idea, uh, you know, who am I to judge? But I don't know if that's gonna be it," but [laughs] he's probably gonna launch 10 apps, and the 11th is gonna be a massive success. And so, that's sort of the- the way I think about those consumer social founder first bets.
[01:02:10] Lenny: I love that. Last question along these lines, for someone that's hoping to get into investing or angel investing in the near future, do you have any advice for folks around that?
[01:02:20] Ryan: Yeah, actually, I wrote a tweet storm and like converted it to a blog post on this 'cause we've get- gotten a lot of ... You probably as well, get a lot of emails or people saying, "Hey, I'm thinking about raising a fund. Like how should I do that?" or "I wanna get into- to venture. I wanna start investing. Like what advice do you have?" So, yeah, I wrote a blog post on this, and there's many different ways to invest. There's, you know, angel investing is one. So, great thing about that is if you have the capital to angel invest, you can do it today, tomorrow. Like you- there- there's no- no sign-offs required. You have maximum flexibility, but of course, you need to have disposable income. You need to be able to- [laughs] be willing to lose all of it and then hopefully you, you know, you'll ma- you'll be on the other side of that and make some money in 10 years. 
 It takes a long time. There's scouting; that's another option. And there are more and more scout funds probably than ever before right now, in different flavors. Some of them are like dedicated kind of scout programs where you have capital to deploy on your own, some are more like you still need approval, but you send the deals, and you get carry on those deals in many cases. Those have pros and cons too. Like they're easier to start and get into than raising a fund typically for most people, but you also are sort of reliant on that- that program or that fund. Um, you might have less autonomy in what you can invest in and what you can't. And then there's a few others; there's SPVs is- is one angle, which works really well for a lot of people. So, um, for those that maybe don't know and- and listening to this right now, SPVs are essentially like a single vehicle, um, investment into one company.
So, you raise money from LPs, from other investors, to invest in this specific company. And there are a few great things about that. Like one, you get deal-by-deal carry, meaning like the- the outcome of that company is- is you get paid when they exit essentially, assuming there's a positive outcome versus a fund, like you have to return the entire fund first. Two, it allows you to also bring in maybe very strategic, helpful people into that particular round for that company, which can actually be a- a strong value add for that founder. The biggest trade-off is it's a lot of work sometimes. You- you have to basically do a fundraiser [laughs] every couple you invest in, and that's super time-consuming for a lot of people. And then the last thing is like r- rai- raising a fund.
So, that's the decision that I decided back in 2017 is I wanted to raise a fund. It's a lot more work to raise the capital and- and- and there's a lot more responsibility in managing funds and so on and so forth, but it provided me with the most flexibility and- and a way to deploy many checks into many companies, especially when I didn't and still don't have like a ton of money to angel invest. So, yeah, those are like different options. Like I think my blog post goes into more like pros and cons for each of those things, but the last thing I'll say actually is, let's say, none of those are really an option. You- you- you don't wanna start a fund. You don't have enough relationships to do SPVs. You- for whatever reason, you can't do a scout. You don't have any money to angel invest. One thing you can also do is just like pretend angel invest. [laughs] And that doesn't mean that you're meeting the founder and like writing a check, but you can write memos, or you can like almost create a fantasy portfolio.
And this is what Vedika, before she joined- joined me, was doing to some extent. She was writing memos about companies she was excited about. And in some ways, she was like doing the job before getting the job, and anyone can do that today. And that can be helpful too if you're applying or trying to prove your- your- your abilities. You could say, "Hey, here are the memos. Here are the companies that I would have invested in, you know, if I had the opportunity, and, you know, here's my thought process behind that."
[01:05:49] Lenny: I love that. I'm curious about the logistics of knowing the prices of all these startups, but anyway, we don't have to get into all of [laughs] that. That's an awesome idea. I've seen people on Twitter do that too. What's- where do you think this all goes for you? Are you thinking of increasing the fund? That's basically the last question. Just, yeah, what's- what’s- the future of Ryan- Ryan Hoover at this point, as far as [laughs] you know?

[01:06:08] Ryan: Yeah, still- still figuring out the meaning of life, as we established earlier.
[01:06:12] Lenny: I thought we cracked that one. 
[01:06:13] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. I'll let you know when I figure it out.
[01:06:15] Lenny: Okay.
[01:06:16] Ryan: Um, uh, [laughs], um, yeah, we're on our third fund right now. We're actually about 30, 35% deployed, so we have plenty of- of capital, and we're not gonna be raising any time soon. Yeah, we're just investing in early stage companies right now, but yeah, when I fast forward like longer term, I don't know. I will always be investing. I'm also more of a fan of maintaining a smaller fund. Our latest fund is 21 million, and that might ... I might change my mind on this, but that might be the biggest fund we ever raise. I might keep it around that same size for the next one because it really allows us to be f- really collaborative. We can write smaller checks. We can fit into competitive deals. I think it's a better product for founders. Like we're not tryin' to take the entire round. We can, you know, try to bring on the Lennys of the world as co-investors, things like that. 
And so, investing will always be a part of my future, but I also love building. Building is- is the most fun, so creating something is- whether it's a company ... I don't know- I don't know what it is. I'm not even gonna call it a company, but building something is hopefully in my future. I just gotta figure out the right idea. And maybe, maybe reflect on your blog post too on the idea generation stuff that you shared 'cause that- that is helpful.
[01:07:22] Lenny: As long as you let me invest all is good. 
[01:07:27] Ryan: [laughs] I don't know- I don't know if I'll- part of me is like, "Do I ever wanna raise from venture?" Now it depends on the idea. If- if I need it, if it's required strategically, then yes, but to be quite honest, maybe I shouldn't say this, like I'm kind of really interested in just owning something 100% and you can always raise venture later. Like it- it's a one-way door, so I kinda wanna delay that door, you know, for whatever I build next, if I can.
[01:07:53] Lenny: I 100% get that. That's how life is with this newsletter operation and I highly recommend it.
[01:07:59] Ryan: Yeah. 
[01:07:59] Lenny: If you can pull it off. Okay. Um, that's it. Just a couple- just where can people find you online? It's kind of a dumb question 'cause you're very easy to find, but where do people go to learn more if they wanna reach out? And then- and then how can listeners be useful to you?
[01:08:14] Ryan: Yeah, I'm just, uh, easy to find. R- Rhoover on Twitter, Ryanhoover.me, simple website. I have a bunch of old blog posts on there, probably with a bunch of broken links and broken images, but it's there. The content's there. I don't know. We're- we're investing- we're investing in the early stage companies, B2B, B2C. If you're building something weird, I don't know, DM me, email me, I'm around.
[01:08:35] Lenny: Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. It's kind of a surreal experience interviewing you. And I'm really honored that you came, and I can't wait for people to hear this. I'm really happy about all the nuggets that [laughs] I was able to extract out of your head, and thank you for sharing them. Thanks for being here.
[01:08:52] Ryan: Yeah, thanks, Lenny. Yeah, these- these conversations are- are helpful and like reflecting on what do I actually believe anyway. So, it's- it's just like writing, it's helpful.
[01:09:00] Lenny: Yeah, and it is just as helpful to everybody else. So thank you again.
[01:09:04] Ryan: Cool. Thanks Lenny.

# A better way to plan, build, and ship products | Ryan Singer (creator of “Shape Up")

## Transcript

Ryan Singer (00:00:00):
I often use this analogy of if you're doing a home renovation, you can have the most beautiful rendering of the new bedroom and we're going to have these lamps on the side of the bed that are coming out from the wall. But if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything.

(00:00:16):
What we need to do in a shaping session is we come out with some kind of diagram where engineers, product and design, they're saying, "We understand that." So the first thing is we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We're not going to take a big concept and then say, "What's the estimate for this thing?"

(00:00:37):
We're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, what is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something? How do we come up with a idea that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Ryan Singer. Ryan was one of the first few hires at 37signals, and through his experience of building Basecamp and 17 years of building product at 37signals, he wrote a book called Shape Up, which shares a very different approach to building software.

(00:01:10):
Appetites instead of deadlines. A big focus on bringing design engine product together into a room to shape the plan versus writing long PRDs or trying to finalize designs before you start building.

(00:01:22):
I've noticed more and more teams adopting the Shape Up method, and especially with AI starting to change how we work and build product, there's this shift coming in how product teams will operate. And so I thought this was the perfect time to do a deep dive into the Shape Up method.

(00:01:37):
This episode is basically going to give you everything you need to give Shape Up a shot on your team or at your company to see if it fixes the problems that you're having shipping great products.

(00:01:46):
A big thank you to Des Trainer, Bob Moesta and Chris Speck for suggesting questions and topics for this conversation. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

(00:02:14):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.

(00:02:31):
Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant. The fine-grain authorization service.

(00:02:51):
Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

(00:03:09):
If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos. com.

(00:03:33):
This episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place?

(00:03:48):
Lucky for you the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS.

(00:04:02):
Organizations like RAMP, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for the customer's employees.

(00:04:18):
And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So, want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.

(00:04:42):
Ryan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Ryan Singer (00:04:46):
I am really happy to be here. Thanks a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
I think this is going to be a legendary episode. There's a lot of interest these days in different ways of working, especially ways that are Agile and SAFe and Scrum and all these ways that people hear about working. Especially in this world of AI where everything's just changing. It feels like there's just an increased interest in exploring different ways of working and specifically it feels like there's been a rise in interest in Shape Up the stuff that you talk about.

(00:05:14):
So, I am really excited to basically help people understand what is this way of working, is it right for them? What are ways to start implementing it? What are maybe some pitfalls you may run into? And as much as possible get into a lot of real talk about how things are actually going on product teams that people often don't like to hear.

(00:05:31):
So, first of all, have you also seen this increased interest in Shape Up?

Ryan Singer (00:05:38):
Yeah, I think it's interesting that we're talking now. I mean, the book came out in 2019 and it's, I've been hearing more and more like, "Oh, we know somebody who's trying it or we're hearing it when we go talk to other companies." So, I think, it's a wave that's slowly building.

(00:05:57):
And it's funny, when it came out, I even tried to have an online forum to get everyone who's interested to talk together and what I started to learn pretty early on is that people don't like to talk about their struggles shipping.

(00:06:13):
Especially CPOs and CTOs don't like to go on a public forum and say, "Our company isn't shipping or our engineering team is stuck, or our team is always lost in the weeds." That's not an easy community topic on an online forum.

(00:06:28):
So, I think, there's also some reasons why it's been word of mouth slowly gathering steam.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's something I struggle with on this podcast. As you said, it's a product and product teams don't want to be sharing when things aren't going great. That's why I introduced Failure Corner on the podcast where it's like, "Okay, but tell me a time things didn't go well."

Ryan Singer (00:06:46):
Oh yeah, that's great. Yeah, because it's so hard to get to that, right? And it's not all just this golden path, rosy, where we're all shipping beautiful, meaningful things all day.

(00:06:55):
It's a hard business and there's no perfect school either that produces expert product managers and CPOs and CTOs and stuff like that. So we're all trying to figure this out and we don't have a lot of sources, so there is a lot of struggle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:12):
And there aren't many options for how to build product. All people really read about is Scrum/Agile/SAFe as they scale and then there's Waterfall, which, "No, I never do Waterfall." Then there's the start up way of just ship and maybe one or two week cycles and then there's Shape Up, so it feels like it's one of the rare other options that exists. And so-

Ryan Singer (00:07:33):
That's one of the things I've been hearing. It's, I hear like, "Oh, we thought there was only Scrum or Kanban, and then we heard there was this Shape Up thing. What's that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:42):
And I think it's always been connected to Basecamp. We're going to talk about that. Just, it works for companies that are nothing like Basecamp. Maybe just touch on that briefly.

Ryan Singer (00:07:53):
Well, I mean, that came as a surprise to me. I mean, when I wrote the book, I had been in Basecamp at that time, I think 15 years, and I actually didn't even know the outside world. I mean, it was Jason's idea to even write the book. Because he said, "Look, a lot of people are going to want to know about this. A lot of people are struggling." And I'm like, "Well, okay."

(00:08:16):
I knew our inside story of we had some growing pains and we had to be able to formalize the way that we were working and shipping so that as we brought new people in that they could participate in that and we could stay fast. So, I knew our internal struggles, but I honestly didn't know anything about the outside world.

(00:08:33):
And it was only after the book came out that it gave me this excuse to start talking to people from all kinds of different companies, and it's been really interesting. There are some really amazing cases of companies of very different characteristics from Basecamp, like VC funded, significantly bigger, very different pressures, different team structure, different skills who are doing it.

(00:08:58):
At the same time, there is also a lot of questions that are coming in my way because honestly, there are so few teams that are structured just like Basecamp, that there are a lot of gaps in the book of like, "Well, what about this, and what about that, and how do we do that in our situation?"

(00:09:11):
So, a lot of my focus today is actually closing those gaps and helping people figure out how can I make this work for me or for our team?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:19):
And you specifically told me, you just now call it instead of Shape Up it's Shape Up In Real Life or Shape Up For Real Life.

Ryan Singer (00:09:24):
Yeah. Well, my wife heard me saying the same thing over and over again on every phone call. And she's overhearing me and she's like, "You have to make a course, you have to do something. You always are saying the same thing."

(00:09:37):
So then this led to this course that we made, which is called Shaping and Real Life. And well, yeah, the idea is the real life part, right? How do I make this work if my designers don't code? It's very contentious to get engineering time. You know what I mean? When there's all these different pressures that Basecamp didn't have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):
We're going to get into the nitty gritty of how this actually works and the key elements, but can you just give a very short overarching summary of how Shape Up is different from how other product approaches are?

Ryan Singer (00:10:07):
I think the way it's different starts with how the way we were working was a little bit different. So, I started working with Jason and David on the first version of Basecamp, which was the flagship product of 37signals back in 2003. We were a team of three.

(00:10:25):
And, I mean, I think, it's for any really small team, when you're just starting out, you don't need a process. You don't need a way of working. It just happens organically because you're together. You don't have to explain it to other people, it just happens on its own, right?

(00:10:40):
But there was always this really intense urgency from both Jason and David, "We've got to get to something we can ship. We have to finish this and move on. We have to get to something that's done." There was just no tolerance for big things that got fuzzy and started to drag. There was always this sharpening to get to what is this thing really and when are we going to get to the end soon?

(00:11:03):
And on top of that, even when we were building V1, David wasn't actually full-time as our only technical person. He was programming 10 hours a week. So, we had this really intense pressure of how can we really use David's time well?

(00:11:20):
We don't want to ever give something that this is the thing we want to build, and then it turns out not to be what we want and we have to throw it away and then come back again or you know what I mean? Those bad cycles of waste.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):
Let me actually ask about this because this is really interesting. So this is DHH. He was working part-time when he started 37signal.

Ryan Singer (00:11:40):
10 hours a week. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):
Was he working on Ruby basically and that whole thing?

Ryan Singer (00:11:45):
Well, Rails came out of the first... So, he told Jason, "I want to try building this in Ruby," because before they had done some collaboration and David had done things in PHP before that and he had this new idea, he wanted to try Ruby, this language he fell in love with.

(00:12:04):
And then the framework, Ruby on Rails, he ended up releasing that after Basecamp was standing. Because it was extracted from the things that were necessary to give V1 of Basecamp to stand up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
So that's what he was doing the rest of his time instead of-

Ryan Singer (00:12:19):
I don't know. I don't know what he was doing the rest of his time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:19):
Probably something great. Something-

Ryan Singer (00:12:23):
But he's always been like that. He's always doing something interesting. He's either racing or who knows what, you know what I mean? But all I knew was that we got 10 hours of that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):
Yeah, I love that that was a constraint to design a way of working that uses engineering time most efficiently.

Ryan Singer (00:12:39):
Yeah, I mean, put that together. So, David's constraint of 10 hours a week and then Jason has this, I mean, I think, many really successful founders and especially CEOs have this thing, it's like all they want to see is movement. You know what I mean? Forward, forward, forward.

(00:12:55):
So when do we get to see it? When do we get to try it? When do I get to put it into somebody's hands? So that combination, there was just so much urgency even though there was no outside pressure. You know what I mean? It was completely just let's say cultural energy of how do we keep getting somewhere and getting to something that we can celebrate and get excited about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:17):
I love that. That's an attribute, I think, of a lot of successful founders. So that makes sense to hear that.

Ryan Singer (00:13:22):
Totally, totally. And that's why where I come back to you, this is the part of the story where, I think, so many companies would say, "Yeah, I know that experience," right? Because, I think, that's probably the seedling of, as you said, of successful companies.

(00:13:34):
Is that combination of urgency and also that those guys were so talented and that they had a clear vision of what they wanted to do and all of that. It's this amazing time actually, these early days.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:44):
Is there anything more to the backstory that's important to share or super interesting?

Ryan Singer (00:13:47):
Yeah, I mean, the other big piece of it was, so Jason and I were this product, what do you call it? The two thirds. So, I was doing UX at the time and I was doing hands-on coding as well. So we're very, very integrated. Everybody does a little bit of everything. All of us were coding.

(00:14:09):
Jason was in the actual app templates as well doing HTML and CSS to do the views. He's doing hands-on design. We're all very much connected with why are we building this? What is this? David's doing the bulk of the programming, and Jason and I were having these little sessions.

(00:14:28):
These little sessions where we would really figure out what the idea was and there would be this moment where you would have a few strokes of this Sharpie pen on a big pad of paper and all of a sudden you'd be like, "Oh yeah, that's the idea. That's the thing we want to go try to build."

(00:14:46):
And for me, those sessions with Jason, they were these short, very, very intense sessions where you're trying to crack the nut together. Where's the idea? What's the concept? How can we go... What's this thing that we're going to go and 10 hours later, right, David's going to come back and we're going to be like, "This is awesome. This thing works and it does something we're excited about," right?

(00:15:10):
That was really the seedling. I mean, actually that continued over years and years and years, those sessions. And that's the seedling of this word in the book shaping. What does it mean to do shaping? It wasn't sitting alone writing a document, it wasn't making a bunch of requirements.

(00:15:31):
It wasn't making a beautiful Figma file to represent a concept that could maybe be a feature. It was this super intense, really exciting collaborative, "What about this? What about that? Oh, maybe this." So that was a really big part of how we worked also.

(00:15:51):
Very intensely collaborative sessions to figure out what the idea is and getting it sharp enough and crispy enough that we could very confidently get a yes from David. That he would know exactly what it is and what it means and come back.

(00:16:06):
It would be what we pictured and it would work the way that we hoped so that we would keep going and we wouldn't have to reverse or go back to the drawing board.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:15):
What it sounds like is essentially you're trying to maintain the startup way of working as the company grows. Everything you're describing is how it feels to be at a startup, and this is a method to keep that. Does that sound right?

Ryan Singer (00:16:28):
That's exactly what became Shape Up, was how do we hold onto that as much as possible? I mean, one big ingredient, we had an advantage also, which was that Jason and David hired so deliberately slowly, and this is a fortunate side effect of the fact that they didn't take investment money.

(00:16:51):
So there was never that moment of now's the moment when we grow. It was always one person. And then the organism adapts. One more person. And so, this natural way of working, it was organically spreading. There were, I think, maybe 10 years before we had the first, "Wait a minute, what just happened?" That project didn't go well, that's not how things normally run.

(00:17:26):
Of course there were always ups and downs, but it was about 10 years later when we had the first project. I mean, I remember the project. I remember being at the end of... It was at that time already, it had been maybe six weeks or seven weeks. We hadn't yet completely locked the six-week thing that went into Shape Up.

(00:17:47):
And I remember we had a review session and there was a fairly new person who's doing half of the work on that team, and we had the review session and it was like instead of, "Oh, look, this is about ready to ship." It was like, "There are a lot of open questions here."

(00:18:06):
"And not only are there a lot of open questions here, we're not getting quick answers as we're asking." And what we're starting to realize is like, "Oh, not only is this not going to ship, but we can't even see the end of this."

(00:18:26):
That was one of those moments where you're like, "Oh, this isn't going to automatically, organically just keep it spreading as we hire forever." You know what I mean? We did reach a point where it's like, "Oh, we're going to have to figure out when this goes well, why does it go well and what do we do differently and how do we formalize that so it's reproducible as we keep onboarding more people?"

(00:18:52):
That's actually when Shape Up as a framework started. That's when I really started to lean in and I took over that responsibility of, "Okay, how do I systematize this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That's a great segue to let's actually talk about how the Shape Up method works. Maybe just at a high level, what are the core ingredients to the Shape Up method?

Ryan Singer (00:19:10):
There's basically three maybe big things. So, the first thing is this notion of we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. So, we're not going to take a big concept and then say, "What's the estimate for this thing?" We're not going to say, "Oh, we need to build a calendar and then do a whole bunch of Figma files or write a whole bunch of requirements and then ask for an estimate."

(00:19:39):
We're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, "What is our appetite for this? What is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something?" And we have that startup moment that we talked about. That moment of like, "Ah, you know what I mean? It works. We got somewhere." At least this, if not the whole project, this meaningful piece, we can literally walk away from.

(00:20:03):
So then what we found was that there was a lot of experimentation. We found that six weeks is the maximum that we can see into the future where we could actually say, "How do we work backward and figure out something we could build in that six weeks and really land it?"

(00:20:21):
That's the first piece. Is working backward from the amount of time we actually want to spend on something and say, "What can we do? What could we shape so that after that amount of time we've gotten to somewhere we want to be?"

(00:20:36):
It's like if you're going to buy a car or you're going to buy a house or you're going to rent a new flat or whatever, you have to have a budget in mind, right? And the budget then is how you choose between all kinds of alternatives and make a lot of hard choices and trade-offs to figure out like, "Well, I want the faster engine, but I have to give this up, or I want it to be fun to drive, but we also need space for longer road trips." You're making all these trade-offs, right?

(00:21:07):
So, this second piece is this work that we call shaping and the shaping work is, how do we actually take this fixed amount of time that we've given for ourselves and vary the scope? How do we come up with a idea, some version of this that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?

(00:21:34):
So, this is those creative sessions that I was talking about where we're jumping all over the room in front of the whiteboard and getting to an idea. And there, the really key thing is that we're getting to an idea where we can see the idea. We understand why we're doing this.

(00:21:52):
We're wrestling with the problem and we're wrestling with the solution until we have an idea that we can actually say, "This is what we want to go build." So it's not just calendar or dashboard or newsletter builder, but it's this idea of how we're going to tackle this problem about the calendar request, right? So that's the shaping.

(00:22:15):
And then the third piece is when we've actually carved out a fixed amount of time, when we've shaped a solution that is from a experience standpoint, from a functionality standpoint, from a technical standpoint, doable and desirable, something that we can make happen in that amount of time, then we can give it to a team.

(00:22:41):
We don't have to do the sometimes called scrum, the paper shredder. That's where you take an idea and then you split it into 100 tickets, right, and you hope that it all glues together still after you've done that step. We don't want to do that.

(00:22:57):
Instead, we want to have a whole idea, give it to a team so they see the whole, they really understand it, right? And then they can come up with their tasks and they can figure out how to track that and break it into pieces so they can actually take more responsibility.

(00:23:13):
And so what we see is way more engagement, especially from the technical team, right? Because instead of, "Here's your ticket," or "Here's your user story," it's like, "Here's the thing you understand, that makes sense, and now you're going to have freedom to figure out how to actually make this a reality."

(00:23:32):
There's going to be a million things to solve in the implementation detail, and now you have a bunch of fun problems and you don't have to keep asking questions to other people to understand what this is or how do I make a trade off or that thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:44):
One of the core elements of this, and I want to confirm is that you can pick and choose these things into your team. You don't need to do this wholesale, correct?

Ryan Singer (00:23:54):
You don't need to do any of it. So, this is where it helps to look at what's going wrong and what are we trying to fix? And then what do I want to bring into this, right?

(00:24:08):
And usually, what I notice is that people, they like to start sometimes with, "Oh, I want to give the team, let's say six weeks and I want to give the team more latitude or let's say more creative freedom, that they're going to be responsible in this six weeks to figure out how to make it happen."

(00:24:24):
And usually a lot of the drive for that is, "I'm getting tired of having so many meetings and rituals and things that are not actually working on the problem and doing the work." I mean, especially scrum teams, they often complain about that.

(00:24:40):
So, what they sometimes see in this is like, "Oh, I love this idea that the team is just going to be cooking for six weeks and they're not going to, we're going to meet as needed and we're going to workshop things, but we're not going to be busy with all these rituals all the time," right?

(00:24:54):
Now, the thing that's tricky is that if you want that reality of the team happily buzzing and humming like some happy bee colony for this six weeks, they need to have a lot more clarity around what's the thing that we're solving, right?

(00:25:12):
And so when we start working backward from that, then what we see is that, "Oh, well, if we don't shape better, then the team isn't going to have the clarity that they need to take over that responsibility, so they can make choices and make decisions and make trade offs so that they can get to the end of this thing." And the worst is that sometimes see cases where people are like, "Okay, we're doing Shape Up. So, you guys are going to build the newsletter builder, okay? But you only get six weeks to do it. So use your fixed time, vary your scope and enjoy your responsibility." You know what I mean? Which is just cruel, right?

(00:25:50):
Because I think I'll quote Bob Moesta, who's been on your show a couple times, "You can't put 10 pounds of crap in a five pound bag." So, it's a high academic statement and we can't just take any project, no matter how giant it is, and then throw it at a team and say, "Figure it out and ship something meaningful in six weeks by cutting away scope," right?

(00:26:13):
So, it starts to raise questions about how do we actually decide together what this project is? Do we actually have clarity around what the idea is and what we're going to build?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):
Let me follow up on a couple of the elements. So appetites, I think for any product manager, engineer, designer, anyone that has experienced, "Okay, we estimate this landing page is going to take a couple of weeks. Great, let's work on it," and then it ends up being six weeks can understand why this makes sense.

(00:26:47):
It's just like, "This landing page is not that important to us. Let us just say we will commit two weeks to it. We'll do as much as we can in two weeks and then we move on. And scope is not allowed to go beyond that." Makes total sense. This just makes so much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):
So much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have just fallen into the problems of estimates not being accurate. Then there's a six-week element and the key there is your, and this is counter to maybe two-week sprints like Scrum, is that kind of the where this comes?

Ryan Singer (00:27:18):
So, actually, it turns out that the six-week is only a maximum and that's really where this number does some work for us. If we think of six weeks as a maximum, that's going to force us to ask some really good questions to ourselves about what piece of this do we really think we can land? Because if you try to say, in six months, we're going to ship this thing, you can't get your arms around all of the problems that have to get solved for an entire six-month chunk of work to actually happen. There are so many unknowns, there are so many ticking time bombs of things that we didn't understand or couldn't foresee, but if we set a ceiling at six weeks, we have a much better chance of, I think that's the size of something where we can actually shape it and surface enough unknowns and reveal that complexity before we're in the middle of it.

(00:28:15):
It doesn't mean that we can't use this technique to do a two-week project, especially if you're on a growth team, you don't want to wait six weeks or, you know what I mean? You're going to have to artificially bundle things together to do six weeks. It's like, look, I've got something I want to ship in the next week and then I've got a thing that might take two weeks after that and then a week after that. So, it's more a question of what we're trying to take on. It's really that upper limit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):
Okay. So, it could be a two-week cycle and the appetite is-

Ryan Singer (00:28:41):
It could be a two-week thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):
Cool. So, it's like we're going to build this new landing page, we're going to give it two weeks and then do a shaping session on that.

Ryan Singer (00:28:48):
Now, the other side of that is when it comes to feature development or building something that's going to be needy enough to sell, then there's very few things that are going to be a substantial value add to a product that you can do in two weeks. So, then you get into a point where, well now, we're just sprinting and we're just taking one bite after the other. And then that's where we can land in that situation where we feel like, "Ah, I can never see the end of this. I just keep going back and saying, one more sprint, one more sprint, one more sprint." But six weeks is this long enough chunk or sometimes, four weeks that the question is kind of, what's big enough that we can actually get somewhere with this amount of time?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:32):
And there's an implied element to this that I think is worth highlighting. The whole idea is you commit to the appetite and if you are not on track to hit that instead of extending the date you cut in order to still hit it.

Ryan Singer (00:29:48):
This is a tricky one.

(00:29:51):
So, you're right that it's implied, but the thing is, in real life, if you make a commitment and you get alignment that we are going to spend six weeks of engineering time building this thing, if you get to that end of that six weeks and something is going wrong, it wasn't shaped, we can't see the end of it. It's more complicated than we thought. All these different things. And by the way, we can also talk about why those things happen, but when we get in that situation, if we're at the end of the six weeks and it's not looking good, we can't just cut off what we agreed to that made this thing valuable. We can't just cut the scope and say, "Oh, well now, we managed to ship inside of six weeks." That's going to kill everybody's morale. Everyone's going to feel disappointed. We're going to feel like this wasn't really worthwhile.

(00:30:43):
And now, we go into the next cycle with this debt feeling that we didn't actually finish the thing we were supposed to finish, so now, we're like overtime. None of that is good. And if we also go the other extreme and just say, well, should we say in the book, we had this principle at base camp which was this notion of the circuit breaker. If a project is not on track to actually finish after the six weeks, we're just going to cancel it and rethink. Almost no teams have the stomach for that, but the version of that that's more stomachable is look, we can't just cancel the project and then say, "Let's see what comes next." But what we can do is say, "We're not going to keep reinvesting in something that we don't understand."

(00:31:34):
So, let's take this out of build mode and bring this back into shaping mode, which might mean different people, a different conversation asking different questions, doing a different kind of work to suss out what is it that's fuzzy here? What is it that we couldn't see? What do we not understand? How do we get to the clarity that we need, so that we can actually say this thing is going to happen if we give it another whack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
I love just how real this approach is not this theoretical. Okay, cool. After six weeks, use just the scope and it's all that's cool.

Ryan Singer (00:32:10):
Yeah, you just cut the scope.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):
Yeah.

Ryan Singer (00:32:11):
No problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):
Shape your gut, put your gut.

Ryan Singer (00:32:13):
I've seen some Shape Up adoptions that looked like that by the way, and that's not the way. The shaping step is crucial. And what you mentioned with your landing page example, by the way, it's so seductive because we can imagine, oh, Parkinson's law, right? If you give me six weeks to do the landing page, I'll find a way to use it, but if you give me two weeks, then I'll stop after two weeks. But when it comes to real product work, where there's some functionality that we have to figure out how to make it exist, we can't just cut the scope if we run out of time. So, what it means is that the shaping work is really working hard together to figure out what are the main moving pieces of this thing. How do we narrow down our understanding of the problem and how do we identify what the moving parts are of the solution and what actually connects together for this feature to work?

(00:33:19):
And when we really get to the level where we can say, "Oh, we need to do this, this, and then the engine is going to turn," that's the place where we can say, "Oh, this is well-shaped." And it's a different kind of work. In shaping in real life, we call it, we actually teach it as doing live shaping sessions, and this was how I did it for years with Jason. We'd get into the room and I had both the technical and the UX side, so both sides were represented there in one person in that case, but for a lot of teams today, we actually teach them how to bring the senior engineering person who isn't just senior in title, the one who actually knows where the bodies are buried, how the old stuff works and what's truly possible and what's hard and what's easy in our infrastructure, like the person that really knows.

(00:34:12):
You bring that person together with the product person who deeply understands the backstory of why this is an opportunity and what we're trying to solve with this. And then a designer in the room and they're whiteboarding and wrestling with each other to get to what's a version of this thing that we believe in that's real that we can actually finish in that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):
This is great. Let's go one level deeper on this shaping session. So, a few tactical questions. How long are these sessions? It sounds like the people that join are a designer and an engineer and an NPM. So, add anything else there. And when do they happen is at the end of a... Do you call it a cycle by the way or sprint, the six-ish week period?

Ryan Singer (00:34:51):
What I actually like is time box actually, because the thing is that some teams need regular cycles because they have parallel teams and they need that cadence in order to reduce management overhead. But if you're small and you only have one or two teams, you might not need to be on a fixed cadence or a cycle plan. You might be able to just set one time box after another. So, the key thing is actually that that time is pushing back at you and that you're being intentional about, what's my time budget that I need to shape into?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:24):
Let me take a quick tangent because if you're, that's so interesting that the time boxes can be very different lengths. Imagine at a larger company, this gets complicated when other teams are trying, there's dependencies and timelines launch and go to market dates and all these things. What's the largest company this approach has worked at? What's the ideal company stage for Shape Up?

Ryan Singer (00:35:47):
It can function in very large companies. We have, for example, I have some friends at a, what is it called? They're doing clinical trials. So, they're in the pharmaceutical industry and the companies, thousands of people, and it's not that every team is doing this, but they have a few teams that are working in important areas and they're doing this and it's completely possible in that context, if you have someone who's at a senior level on the engineering side who is able to make the right architectural choices and also do some negotiating and be the backstop to make sure that someone isn't going to get pulled away onto something else, if you can carve out, oh, this system can be worked on independently of that system. This was actually what David at Basecamp has always been amazing at is this dependency, how...

(00:36:47):
It's actually not. It's not. So many people are used to it and they think that it's just how it is, but it's actually not. It is possible for engineering leadership, good engineering leadership untangles things, so we can work on this system without having to be thinking about this other system somewhere else. So, when you have some untangling with your infrastructure and with your architecture from an engineering standpoint, then you have some freedom. And then if you can also figure out the capacity management side of I'm going to protect this team from that other work for this number of weeks, you can really get a lot done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):
This insight that you can operate this way at a larger company and the whole company doesn't have to operate this way, I think is really freeing to a lot of people. What's the adapter? And I want to come back to the actual shaping process, but I can't help but ask this. Say the company's operating a quarterly cadence or six month cadence and then there's a team operating in a two week, sometimes six weeks, sometimes four week cadence advice on how to, what's the adapter that connects those two cadences?

Ryan Singer (00:37:50):
So, there's two different things. So, I've seen cases where they've decided on a four-week plus two-week or so they'll do five-week and then one week of cool down in between and then they time it so that it adds up to a quarter. I've seen that. The other thing I've seen is when the team is just continuously delivering meaningful things, it doesn't have to line up because from the executive level, if you are CP or CTO or in these bigger cases, it's more like a VP in some area, but you're coming to the table where you're supposed to be reporting of what your group is doing. And when you are consistently saying, "We said we were going to do this and nothing finished and now, we're doing this and it's going to finish," and the next time you say, "We said we were going to do that and it's finished, without excuses and without, well, maybe another few more months or we're working at it," that's what everyone wants to see is that movement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:52):
Yeah, if you're doing great, people will leave you alone. That makes sense.

Ryan Singer (00:38:54):
For sure. For sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):
I love that. I love that point. Okay, coming back to shaping, maybe one way that would make it real easy for people to understand, what's the output of the shaping session?

Ryan Singer (00:39:05):
The output of the shaping session is, and by the way, about shaping session, maybe we can talk a little bit about what shaping is not because we need the contrast sometimes. So, very often, when people try Shape Up, what I see is a product team creating either a lot of Figma files or maybe a lot of documentation, like a PRD with a bunch of requirements and a bunch of backstory and good reasons why we're doing this and stuff like that. And what you see is that when you give that to a team as this is what we shaped, what happens is it blows out. So, you probably know about what happens when the Figma file makes first contact with the engineering team. There's a reality check that happens there and very often, there's a back to the drawing board. So, when there's a lot of solutioning all the way down to detail without engineering involved, usually, that's a painful recipe and then it's like, "No, we can't do that," or, "Actually, it doesn't work like that."

(00:40:16):
And then on top of it, the other big challenge is that there's so much that you can't see on the surface of a UI. How do we flow from here to there? What are the different cases of logic? In which case do we move from here to here to here in the flow? What is happening behind the scenes? It's like the engineering team, they have to put on their x-ray goggles and study this thing to try and understand what's happening underneath. I often use this analogy of if you're doing a home renovation, you can have the most beautiful rendering of here's the new bedroom, and we're going to have these lamps on the side of the bed that are coming out from the wall, and you can have the perfect rendering and the perfect lamp and the perfect color, but if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything if you're going to have to rip open those walls to feed some lines up to those lamps.

(00:41:15):
So, what we need to do in a shaping session when it's going well is we come out with some kind of drawing or diagram where engineers, product, and design are all looking at that and they're saying, "We understand that. I know exactly what to go build." I'll use the example of the calendar from the book. So, what is a calendar? So, first of all, there was this work that we had to do before we could even shape it, which is like, can we actually narrow down this problem? In shaping in real life, we call this framing. And in the book, there's a chapter called Setting the Boundaries where we get into this and it's like, look, we are not going to just build calendar, which is Google Calendar. Who knows where it ends? We narrowed it down to we understand that for our specific customers who are requesting this again and again, it's more about I need to see empty spaces and in the existing agenda view, I can only see things that are already scheduled and I can't see free spaces where I could book something.

(00:42:21):
So, we got to that point of what we're trying to solve here is the empty spaces. So, that's a good frame. Then what are we actually going to build? We came to, here's a good rule of thumb. If it's shaped well, you can usually describe it in less than 10 moving pieces. If I can say, "It's going to have this, this, this, this, this, and this," and that's how we're going to let people see the empty spaces, that's a good indicator that it's clear enough that it's shaped well. So, in this case, when you go to an airline and you want to book something, you see this two-month grid. So, it's like there's going to be two months side by side, but they're just going to have dots in them to indicate if there's a free day or not, if there's something in that day or not, like the iPhone calendar, I think still has this where it's just dots on the month view.

(00:43:17):
And then if you tap a day with a dot in it or without a dot in it, there's going to be an agenda view that slides underneath, which is going to show you what's scheduled in that day. And then there's going to be navigation to go forward and back in the months, there's going to be a create button to create an event, and that's more or less it. So, what you can see here is it's not like, what is a calendar? It's not a calendar. It's a two-month dot grid with scrolling agenda view underneath and the ability to hit new when you're looking at an empty space to create something in what you're viewing. So, that's the kind of thing where that's shaped and we can talk about what that means and what it entails, and we can have a really practical, realistic conversation about, is that a thing we can do in six weeks?

(00:44:12):
That's going to be a real conversation and not looking at a whole bunch of mock-ups and trying to x-ray to figure out what's actually the intent here and what's really real and what's not and what's possible and what's not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
That was a great example. This is really helpful. So, if I were to try to describe this, essentially what you're coming out of it with a shaping session with is like the user experience with just wire frames/sketches of the screens and the key buttons and flows. So, it's like the architecture with key components, not like a dock of spec and not final design, and also not just a user story. As a user, I need to be able to see empty spaces.

Ryan Singer (00:44:56):
Exactly. So, because the thing where it goes wrong. If we're going to commit engineering time and it's like we believe there's some way to see empty spaces, but the way is a question mark, it's a really risky way to spend that time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):
Because you're committing, right? It's like-

Ryan Singer (00:45:12):
Yeah, we're committing and that time is really valuable. That's six weeks of engineer's time, and that time wasn't easy to get in the first place because, of course, there's all these other forces in the company that want to be doing something with the engineers. So, if we want that team to be really using that time well where they are moving, they understand what they're solving and they're creatively engaged because they know what it's supposed to be doing, they need to have that clarity both on the problem side of this is about the empty spaces and on the solution side of it's a dot grid with two months and a scrolling agenda view and a button. There's still a million interesting creative tasks there in the actual high fidelity design in the code. There's so many things to solve there, but that is something that they can all hold in their heads and understand and work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):
This episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools, no more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers, everything from resourcing to voice of customer to road mapping to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations, no compromises. Ready to see it in action? Head to airtable.com/lenny to book a demo. That's airtable.com/lenny.

(00:46:58):
You mentioned, and I think a lot of people listening to this are going to be like, "Oh, I'm scared of doing this," is if you get too detailed, the engineers and designers on the team are just like, "What the hell? You're just telling me what to build. That sucks. I don't want that kind of work." So, is the solution to that the engineering lead was super involved and detailed, and the design lead was super involved, and so you can trust that you're not just the code monkey building the thing they told you to build?

Ryan Singer (00:47:26):
That's really interesting. I got to tell you, the dominant failure case that I see in the real world is always, again and again, not enough detail. And it's also the most common failure mode where the engineers run back to the product folks and say, "I'm not getting enough from you." It is really like that, but I can understand why the hair stands up on the back of the neck a little bit thinking about it because, of course, if you give a senior engineer like, "Here's how I want you to go implement the schema for this database change for this model," they're going to be like, "What do you think? Who are you? Who are you?" You know what I mean? But what's really interesting is it's not a universal thing. The amount of detail that the team is going to feel helps them is a dial that we can turn that depends on who's on the team.

(00:48:28):
So, if you have a more junior person who's on the build team and then you have a more senior engineer who's involved in the shaping, they can make that junior engineer much more successful with additional detail. So, we're going to do this and I would suggest approaching it like this, this, this, and this. That junior person is, when they don't know how to do it, they're not going to ask because they don't want to show that they don't know, and they're going to hide the fact that they're lost and it's going to blow up later in the project. And on the other hand, if they are given more guidance, they're going to be able to be successful. They're going to learn about this is how this person who knows well, kind of approached it and then in the next round or a few projects later, you can dial it back and say, "Well, let's give less detail and see how they handle it."

(00:49:19):
So, you can really give people bigger shoes to grow into and help them to be successful. And then, of course, you can also do it the other way around where if you've got some really stellar talent on the team and you have a long history and you have a lot of trust that they are going to be able to understand and solve it, then of course, you can leave things out.

(00:49:40):
But the thing that I often see is if there's someone on the build team who really feels that they should be involved in the fundamental decisions about the approach, then a better solution would be to actually bring them into the shaping and have them play that technical role in the shaping session. If they have the right skills and the right perspective and the right knowledge to play that role well, then just bring them into the shaping. So, it's all about how do we bring people into a moment where we are using their strengths and then we're giving them an input, so that whatever their work step is that they're able to apply the maximum creativity, but also have the maximum clarity, so that they can really use that time well and also feel good about what they're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:29):
It feels like the core of this is de-risk the biggest risks and address the biggest unknowns as much as possible. There's probably this 80% of here are the risks. Let's just understand them deeply before we commit to this appetite.

Ryan Singer (00:50:42):
That is exactly right. There are these, we can call them rabbit holes, we can call them time bombs. There are these things where we say, "Oh, it'll be fine." One example, simple example, I worked with a team and they had a step of onboarding in a FinTech product and there was this step of onboarding and they would lose a lot of people in the funnel at that step because you had to fill out a whole bunch of information, and they figured out that they could actually pipe that data in from one of the partners that they had. They were partnered with banks and they're like, "Oh, we don't even need to be asking people this. So, we're going to fix conversion. We're going to eliminate a step from our user experience. It's going to be great."

(00:51:26):
The thing that they didn't look at was if you go into the code on that step of the onboarding, it's not actually one step. There's like three different branches of that step depending on which bank the customer is integrated on. And so, that's the kind of thing where it all sounds so great and simple, and then you get into the weeds and you realize like, "Oh, wait a minute." You know what I mean? So, now, we have decisions to make. Now, if you're in the middle of a project and it's already been resourced and people are already on the hook that we're supposed to be doing this, and you already got the alignment that the engineering time is happening for this, and you're finding that out in week four. You know what I mean? You did all these beautiful drawings, by the way, and now, you're finding this out in week four, that's a bad place to be.

(00:52:14):
But if we're in the shaping room and we didn't kick this thing off yet, we didn't even green light the project yet, and we have an engineer there, not just the product people, not just the designer, but we have that engineer who really insists on sometimes, I like to think of it like the grumpy old plumber who's seen everything and he insists on opening up the walls and looking at the pipes before he'll give you a quote. So, it's like when you've got that person in the room, they're saying, "Yeah, that all sounds great. Let's take a quick look at the code and figure out what screen you're actually talking about. Just let's just take a quick look." And it only takes a moment to open up the code, find this thing that we're talking about, and really look at it and say, "Oh, it's more complicated than we thought."

(00:52:59):
And now, it's not like, "Okay, now, we're screwed and the project is going to be bigger." Now, we can have a really cool conversation about trade-offs. So, let's say we've got three different integrations here, three different segments integrated into different banks. How big are they relative to each other in terms of the deals we made or the percentage of customers who flow through those three different conditions? If we just did this on one of those branches, would it be a win? And if we did it on all three, how much more time would we have to negotiate for and would it feel worth it? You see, we're getting into this horse-trading of what is important, what's worth it, what do we need to get out of it? And that's really productive. And when you're doing that before the project starts off, that feels like, "Oh, we're talking about the important things. We're not failing right now. We are engaged in the hard questions that are going to enable us to really ship something that's successful later."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):
Well, let's go one level deeper on this shaping session, because clearly, that is so core to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this. So, we're not going to-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
... to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this, so we're not going to answer all the questions, and there's a lot of detail and nuance. But a few questions, how long do these usually take? It sounds like a whole day experience, and then it sounds like you invite as few people as possible, but not too few people. What's your guidance on who should join?

Ryan Singer (00:54:21):
In this shaping and real life course, we've been doing workshops where we try to help people to learn what it's like in a shaping session. One of the things that's always interesting to me is how... So Kathy and I will be running the session and we have to... People aren't used to working so fast. What are we actually doing right now? What's the decision? What's an idea right now? We're not going to go away and draw something, and then I'll comment on a document and then come back and get together tomorrow. What ideas do we actually have right now starting from zero? So imagine, we've narrowed down the calendar problem too. It's about empty spaces. We are willing, from a business standpoint, to spend six weeks on a whack at this where it's solved. We believe there's a way that's possible, so what can we come up with?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):
And that's the input to the framing session or sorry, the shaping session.

Ryan Singer (00:55:27):
Exactly. Having a narrowed down problem from the framing work, and this is a whole other topic of very often the PMs are sometimes just taking something at face value and not negotiating down to really narrow down what is this really, and where is the value in this? But let's suppose that that's happened, that we've narrowed down the problem, so now we've got a narrow problem. So now what we need to do is try out different ideas, and this is the real thing. We have to try to break them. So I want to draw an idea, and then I want the technical person to find, oh, this isn't going to... You know what I mean? This isn't going to work because of this reason. Or the product person is going to be looking in and saying, "I get that that's really an easy way to do it technically, but I don't think that we're actually delivering the value if I play through the customer scenario here." You know what I mean?

(00:56:24):
So there's these different angles where the idea can fail, and one of the things that we also coach people to do in a session is not just to go down one path and then be stuck in one idea and now you're going in circles around little details of one idea for three hours, but to really step back and say, "Here's an approach. What if we had the scrolling agenda view, okay? And that's idea A. Then what's a very different way of doing this?" Do you know what I mean? If we didn't want to have the agenda view there, is there a way to do this where it's just a month view? Let's see if we can draw that. So that's the thing that's happening. You asked about the time, and I started with people aren't used to just going all the way in to actually trying ideas.

(00:57:16):
So there is a little bit of learning how to just face that blank page and start trying things together. What we find is that a three-hour session can be very, very productive to help you figure out what do we already have that are possible approaches to this? What are some major missing things? Like, okay, I've got the calendar dot grid, I've got the agenda idea, but what about multi-day events? Do you know what I mean? So there can be these things, these what abouts. So then maybe we break and we think for a little bit, and somebody sketches some ideas on that and does a spike or two on something, and we come back again for another three hours or we come back the next day. And what I would say is if the project that you're trying to do is doable with, let's say, your existing technology, you're not inventing a new algorithm, you're not inventing some new database or... You know what I mean?

(00:58:25):
You're not doing a new AI model. It's more about how do I use the APIs and the frameworks and the tech stack that we have? How do I put that together to build something? Then if the problem is clear and the time is now, you will be able to come to a conclusion about what's possible to build in three sessions, something like that. The key thing is leaning into those sessions and really wrestling with each other. If you have just the product and the designer there and then it's like, well, we'll show this to the technical person later, then it can all blow up. And then you find out it's more complicated than you thought and you have to go back to the drawing board. We need to have all the necessary information in the same room for these sessions to go fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:17):
There's so much genius built into this approach, and it sits on top of human nature. One is just, you need to actually spend... go into the deep edge cases and nuances and not just-

Ryan Singer (00:59:31):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:32):
Yeah, that's fine. Let's go with [inaudible 00:59:34].

Ryan Singer (00:59:33):
More concreteness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:34):
Very concrete, very in depth, and then the appetites are... There's just so many elements of this that just connect with the way humans work versus the theory of just like, "Yeah. Well, let's see how long this will take. It'll be a great... and we'll figure it out as we're building. We don't need to really figure this out. Yeah. We don't have time for that."

Ryan Singer (00:59:52):
And we're solving a puzzle together, if it needs to be doable in this amount of time. But it also has to hit these points in terms of the problem we're solving. You know what I mean? It has to do these things, but in this time. One other thing that I would mention is that we can't be drawing Figma files. By the way, I'm being very mean to Figma so far in this conversation. There is a time when it's the right time for the Figma file. What we want to do is have that clarity around the... Let's say, we already know where the sink is going in the kitchen and now we can make final calls about the tile and the exact fixture-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):
Grout color.

Ryan Singer (01:00:38):
... and stuff like that. Right, grout color. We don't want to have to throw it all away every time something changes. So there's a time and a place where Figma is amazing and feels good and it's like, oh, now it's beautiful. Now, it's amazing. But in a shaping session, you can't collaborate on something so high fidelity. So we need also some ways to collaborate, and this is where you see these techniques in the book, like breadboarding and fat marker sketching. These are tools to help us express an idea very, very clearly in detail. We're going to hit this button and from this button, go to here. This calculation runs, then we get this answer, and then we have this choice to go here or here. That's the thing that we need to be seeing and that's the level of detail where we can move fast together but still see something real as more this breadboarding level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):
Fat marker session is very evocative of what this whole session is about, is very high level sketches. That's a great term.

Ryan Singer (01:01:41):
The danger there that I often see is that what we don't want is to say, "Oh, Figma isn't the right thing at this level. So instead, we're going to do fat marker sketches," and what you get is the equivalent of a blurry Figma. Do you know what I mean? Just less detailed. What we need from a fat marker sketch for it to be valuable to us as builders is it has to really communicate the idea. When I look at that, I'm like, "Oh, now I get it?" And if it's more this general wire frame of dashboard goes here and there's going to be four reports, and it's like I still don't know what to build, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
Mm-hmm.

Ryan Singer (01:02:23):
So if it's not telling me what to build, so maybe this is a way to come back to your question about what's the output of the shaping session, it's like it's shaped if we can give this to a technical person and they say, "Yeah, I know what to go build now."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):
I'm very happy with our overview of the process. I think we've done a really good job giving people the gist. And obviously, if they want to actually implement it, they can get the book and dive in or work with you, which we'll point people to. Say someone's like, "This is awesome. I want to do this." What would you say is a good first step for a team that's currently... let's say, they're in startup land, and they're just shipping every two weeks, maybe every week? So maybe for that bucket of folks and then also for a larger company, I don't know, Agile Scrum SAFe, and they're just like, "Oh, let's try something different."

Ryan Singer (01:03:07):
Sometimes dev teams, they like the idea of not having the Scrum ritual, so they want to take in the six weeks, but unless the engineering and product come together to figure out how to collaboratively shape, like we talked about before, that time box isn't going to go well. So I-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):
They think they're going to not have to do standups, but now it's a day of hard thinking.

Ryan Singer (01:03:33):
Well, it turns into even more meetings, because we don't know what to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):
And the more meetings is just that shaping session specifically. Right?

Ryan Singer (01:03:44):
No, what I mean is that if we didn't-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):
Oh, right. I [inaudible 01:03:46] right.

Ryan Singer (01:03:46):
If we only adopted the six-week cycle and said we're going to figure it out and we didn't adopt the shaping, then we just don't know what to do. And then we reached the end, and we're basically scrambling to shape it as we go. And then we run out of time, and then we feel like this wasn't... It was nice to get a break from the Scrum rituals, but we can't say that we are knocking the champagne bottle on the boat because we're celebrating the launch or whatever, again and again. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):
That's a good, actually, time to maybe talk about there's obviously the spring kickoff in Scrum. What's main difference for people, because they may be thinking, "Oh, this is just like a spring kickoff." That's-

Ryan Singer (01:04:22):
Oh, that's a good one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):
... big deal.

Ryan Singer (01:04:24):
That's a good one. So what you often see in a Scrum team is that there's somebody who creates these tickets of these are the things that are going to happen inside of the sprint. Really, in my opinion, too many cases, it's not the person who's doing the building who's creating those tickets.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:45):
So your product owner.

Ryan Singer (01:04:46):
So there's a big, big gap there. We could talk a lot about that, but there's gaps in context. The person who's writing the ticket doesn't actually understand the work that's involved. You know what I mean? So there are so many unknowns and time bombs waiting in those tickets that sound reasonable, but they weren't really created by the person who understands the work that needs to happen. So the key difference is two things. So in Scrum, you have a person who's not the builders making tickets, and this is what in the cruel picture is the paper shredder. In the shape-up world, you have a single idea that was shaped. This is the thing we shaped with the two months in the agenda view and da da. Go make your own tasks, because you're the professionals. Do you know what I mean? So the contractors, if you're building a house, they have to know the plans, but you don't have to tell them, "Now take the hammer and go over here."

(01:05:52):
That's their, right? So in a shape-up world, a kickoff is, here's the well-shaped idea, and now this time box starts. At Basecamp, it was really, really loose because they are just stocked with senior people. They have so many very senior engineers and all the designers are coding. They're very technical, really, really skilled people. What I found is helpful when the team is a little bit more mixed, if they're not all super senior, is a simple exercise of at kickoff, take whatever was shaped and just draw a grid with nine boxes, and give me nine boxes of the nine major chunks that you think have to get implemented from an implementation standpoint. So translate this into nine major scopes of implementation that need to somehow happen over the time box. So really, really useful exercise to kick things off, and we have a lot of teams doing that now.

(01:06:52):
If you take six weeks, that's 30 business days. You divide that by nine, it's four days per box. So you're going to get a lot of clarity from a quick exercise. And again, this is done by the builders. This is a really also good exercise for them to notice like, "Oh, wait a minute, we think there's too much scope here. Even though it seemed reasonable, when we put it into nine boxes, it's like, I don't think we can do this all." Or it's also a good moment where somebody who's more junior might describe their implementation approach, and then someone who's senior can review that and say, "Actually, we've done that before, and we'll run into this trouble if we don't use this other thing." So those really nice coaching moments can happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):
If you were to try this approach and have a shaping session, this is a sign you're heading in a good direction, is if the output, the team that's building it can come up with nine... Does it have to be nine? Is six cool, 10 cool?

Ryan Singer (01:07:55):
What I found is if it's more than 10, then you just get into ticket land of, here's a million things I have to do. You know what I mean? If you have 100 things, that doesn't tell me anything. But if it has to be nine or less.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:10):
Nine or less. Okay. Okay, cool.

Ryan Singer (01:08:13):
I actually think... I'm speculating here, but the UX designers in your audience will know about this rule of seven, plus or minus two. It's this cognitive science principle that was found about how many things someone can hold in their head at once. So this nine is the upper limit of seven plus or minus two, and it basically... It's like, do we actually have a picture of what it means to build this that we can also hold in our heads? Can we see the whole castle?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):
So what I'm hearing is if you're on a, say, Agile Scrum team today, if you want to start trying this out, it's schedule a shaping session, assume it's six weeks to start, try to come into it with a framing of here's the problem we're trying to solve. Is that a good way of thinking about it, like the problem we're trying to solve?

Ryan Singer (01:08:59):
Yeah, for sure. The question is what problem are we trying to solve, because the shaping work is more what are our options for the solution? And if the problem is too fuzzy and big, if the problem is just calendar, then the shaping is going to be this ever-expanding, never-ending thing, and we're not going to be able to get anywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:16):
Yeah. Okay. So you spend three hours, maybe six hours in the first session. Would you recommend try to keep it to this many hours when you're first trying it up?

Ryan Singer (01:09:26):
No, I wouldn't do that. I think the key thing is actually if you get to the point where you're trying to hold a shaping session and you manage to get product and engineering into the same room to do it, you are far along. You're doing great if you're at that point. Oh, so much of the challenge is getting to the point of aligning between product and engineering that we cannot have projects that are dragging and dragging and dragging. We can't keep ending in a place where this is the end of a sprint or the end of a cycle and we still can't see the end of it, or we have to make so many cuts and compromises at the last minute that it's not the quality of... or it's not really matching what it was supposed to be in the first place. When those problems are happening or... Also by the way, this is surfacing at the exact level.

(01:10:22):
Imagine, you're the CPO, you're the CTO, and you are supposed to be answering to, "How's that work going?"

(01:10:30):
And it's like, "Well, actually, we're working on it. I can just think of a couple of times when I needed to go to Jason, and he expected me to be making progress on something and I had gotten nowhere on it. And that feeling when you are with top leadership in the room and you don't have a good answer for where you are on something is like... Oh, it's brutal, right? And then from the CEO's perspective, it's like, "Where's the movement? We're running a business here. Really, nothing is shipping still?"

(01:11:03):
This can't just keep happening. So there's some recognition somewhere either at the higher levels or within the team of, we don't want to keep dragging, we don't want to keep being lost in the weeds, and then this can be the activation energy. You gather the power to be like, "Okay, we actually want to try something different."

(01:11:26):
And in that case, what I would say is what usually works best is, okay, we're going to try a pilot project, and what we want to do is, as you said, choose a problem that's important enough to all of us that we think it's meaningful, it's going to be worth trying to do well. And it doesn't have to be six weeks. It could be something that is a little bit smaller, maybe you feel comfortable taking on three week thing for the first time. What's important is just matching these things together.

(01:11:55):
Here's a problem that we actually care about. It's timely, something that we would like to be shipped soon. It's not so small that we're not going to actually learn this new muscle, and it's big enough that it's going to feel like we really achieved something. So maybe that's going to be four weeks, maybe it's going to be six, maybe it's three, I don't know. And then getting to a place where we wrestle a bit with the problem to get the problem narrowed down. We get into our shaping session, and then we do our best. Do you know what I mean? And usually, what happens too is if we have an engineering team that's going to become free to do this work for those X number of weeks, that's the upper limit on how long we can spend to shape, and that's another real life thing, is sometimes we talk about if...

(01:12:51):
On the one hand there's this universe of never ending documents back and forth to get feedback and comments, and then on the other hand there's like the team is going to be available. We're trying to actually do this, so actually, we've got a week to shape because engineering needs to kick off next week. Do you know what I mean? That's a little bit more the real scenario when you're actually in this aligned world of we want to ship something now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):
Yeah, real life constraints. That's a really helpful way of telling you how much time you have to do this. For people that are just like, "I don't know, any friends that are using this. It's like weird, this way of working. It's not a thing I hear about all the time." What can you say to them to help them be like, "Okay, I should actually give this a try. Here's how many people are using it. Here's impact that you've seen." Anything you can share that would help them get over that hump?

Ryan Singer (01:13:40):
I would say wait until it hurts more. If the unfamiliarity is the big problem with it, then maybe the things are fine. Because it's not like this is the only way. It's more like, changing is really hard, and if there's a good reason to do it and it's like, look, we've done it the old way. We've tried different experiments. We've even already churned through a new head of product, or we've got a different CTO in and we're still having the same problems, then there comes a point where it's like, I know that this is uncomfortable, and I don't know somebody who's done it, but I think we need to try something different because we can't continue this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:30):
That is a great answer. Following that same thread, just what are signs that it's time to try something? What sort of pain do you often see that's like, okay, you shouldn't look into this seriously?

Ryan Singer (01:14:44):
There are pains all along the journey. So I think the place where it's most obvious is at the end of the line when we thought we were going to be done and this thing is just dragging and dragging and dragging. The teams, we're not shipping things. We're running in place. We keep going in circles on this like we don't see the end. Of course, that's the culmination, but there's also a lot of pain points along the way.

(01:15:11):
So if we go all the way upstream, if we go to the source of a project, sales talk to a customer... You know what I mean? Or sales talk to a lead, and they have this idea of this thing we need to build, or the CEO had this idea in the shower the other day, or the product team did a whole bunch of research and they have a big case for why this is the thing that's important to build next. Whatever it is, there's a source from the business perspective of this is the thing we should do next.

(01:15:44):
If we just say dashboard and we don't negotiate what that means, if we just say calendar and we don't negotiate what that actually is, then what do we experience? This fuzzy thing where it's really hard to get to a conclusive answer about, yeah, that's what we need to go do. It's like the ever expanding blob. So if you've felt that before, that's already a first pain. And then of course, where does it go from there? So we say calendar, so we don't know what it means, but we say calendar, so now we give it to product and we've either got a whole bunch of Figma files or we have the PRD with a million requirements about what a great calendar is. Of course, I don't want to be cruel to the people who are putting their hearts into that work, because the Figma file is beautiful. It's just coming a little early. And the PRD is full of a lot of true things that are probably really important for decision-making in the project, but the way that it's packaged at that moment isn't something that gets absorbed. You write this document and I'm sorry, who actually reads it? You know what I mean? I know it's painful, but it's like that. And then even when we try to read it, because it wasn't shaped and we didn't get down to it's this, it's that, it's that, and that's how it works, it's hard to walk away from reading that and have anything that's in your head as, this is what we're going to go build. It's like a million puzzle pieces that you're going to have to solve. So what we see is either there's the Figma file and then there's the pushback from engineers. There's the PRD, but then it's like, okay, but we still don't actually know what to build.

(01:17:40):
There's all those things where, instead of moving forward, there's more and more questions, more and more pushback, more and more going back to the drawing board. So that's another big indicator that something is going wrong. And then when we're in the building and we thought we knew what we agreed to, we thought we all said, "Yeah, this is what we want to go make," and it's just more and more questions coming out. More and more unexpected complexity, things that we didn't anticipate, and it just doesn't feel like we're getting warmer and coming closer. It just feels like it's getting harder and harder. Those are all the signs that whatever process you use, that there's a lack of clear shaping and there's a lack of clear framing because there's a lack of clarity around what it is that we're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):
Before we started recording, you made this interesting point that there's always talk of feature factories and that rarely are they actually efficient factories. They don't actually work. Talk about that.

Ryan Singer (01:18:38):
Yeah. Well, I understand what the feature factory critique is supposed to be. It's actually to the framing point of we're not negotiating the value and the outcome we're trying to get from something. We're just taking it and building it. And then of course, in the end, according to the feature factory critique, we just built it because somebody said we should build it, and then people didn't use it and didn't value it, and the product is just getting bloated. The thing is that, I would say if you have a feature factory, meaning you're continually cranking out features, you're probably quite healthy. All you need to do is feed a different input to the beginning of the factory.

(01:19:18):
What most teams are struggling with is that they don't have predictable repeatable shipping of things. At least from my experience, the bigger really widespread struggle is, stuff isn't moving, it's dragging. I can't see the end. I'm losing my... I'm feeling burned out. You know what I mean? It's not exciting to work on this anymore, all that a thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Maybe last question here is what's the sweet spot stage for a company to start using Shape Up? You basically worked in this way from the very beginning when it was just three people. What do you find... Should startups that are just starting out start working in this way, or do you find it's more useful later on?

Ryan Singer (01:19:58):
We didn't formalize it until we had to, and there was a long time where there wasn't a fixed length for projects. There was just an understanding of the urgency and a feeling of what too long felt like. And it didn't actually click into, oh, this is a cycle length and this is six weeks, and then we pause, and this is who comes together to make the decision of what's the next project, and here's who is mainly doing the shape. You know what I mean? All that stuff didn't get solved until we had reached a certain size. Usually, the main tipping point if we start from smaller to big is there's a phase when the founders are still involved in everything, and so it doesn't matter what your process is, it's going to be fine.

(01:20:40):
But then you start to hire the first other people and then for the first time you try to delegate some of those things and the founders try to be less involved, and that's often where a lot of these problems start to appear. And the founders start to ask themselves like, "We used to be fast, and now we hired people because we needed to scale, but now we're slow. So how do we be fast again? Because we know what-

Ryan Singer (01:21:00):
... well. So like, "How will we be fast again?" Because we know what it's like. If we just got back in there as founders and got our hands dirty, like we could make this go. But how do I get the people that we've brought in to make these trade-offs and make these decisions and how do I get the work to flow again? So that's something that we definitely see there. So that's a really good moment. I'm onboarding new people. I don't know what to tell them how to work. I don't want to introduce a bunch of scrum rituals. Just winging it on Kanban isn't working, because they don't have enough clarity around what to go after. So I have to babysit them all the time. You know what I mean? Like these kinds of things.

(01:21:40):
There is another extreme, which is I... We've already gone past that. We've been scrum or whatever for years. The company has been growing, like revenue is coming in, like sales is doing their job, like things are running. But man, nothing is getting out the door. And we're years in and we have an entrenched development. We have like an entrenched engineering team, which is a wall away from an entrenched product team and everybody's apart. And this thing is like, we're like stuck.

(01:22:19):
And that is more where there's going to be some tensions that are starting to appear at the executive level. There's going to be some finger pointing. There's going to be some like, "Why isn't this moving? Why isn't this happening? How can we be spending so much money in all these engineers and we don't have anything to show for it?" And that's a point where there can be kind of a... Some hard conversations need to start happening about, "How do we actually start to negotiate around how we spend time?" And we can't just have endless refactorings and infrastructure projects, but we need to be actually building things that we can sell again.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:54):
What an idea.

Ryan Singer (01:22:56):
Yeah. You know? But it can... There are a lot of engineering orgs that have been standing around for a while and it's all refactoring all day and tech debt and stuff like that. And there's reasons why all those things got there, but there comes a point where we have to figure out how to cut through it and make some hard choices so that we can carve out time to build the stuff that's actually going to be needle moving again and not just sustaining us where we are to run in place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):
I imagine this latter bucket is who you mostly work with, the kind of companies that bring you in.

Ryan Singer (01:23:33):
It's been a lot of the folks who still remember what it was like to be fast and they're kind of newly too big and they don't like being slow. I've had a lot of that. I think that your intuition is right. That the market for the last category is the biggest, but it's hard to reach them. It's not easy to talk about these things. These are sensitive topics. Do you know what I mean? Like, "Our engineering team isn't shipping," and it's happening at leadership level. There's a ton of complaints happening deeper in the org, but nobody down in the org can change anything. At the end of the day, it's actually the interface at the executive level of being able to say, "How are we using our time? We have to change something."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:19):
To make it even more concrete in that first bucket, what's the size of org that you find is most in need of this? It's like, "How many engineers?" Or is it like when they hire the first PM? Like what's kind of the-

Ryan Singer (01:24:29):
I sometimes have the like, "How the heck do I hire the first PM and what do they do?" conversation. But usually, it's later than that. It's after they hired the first PM, after they hired the second PM, and maybe even the third. And they're getting to the... Product and engineering together are like 30, 50 people and it's like, "We thought we put everybody in the right roles. We kind of did what we were supposed to do and everything is just grinding. And why are we so slow?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):
Perfect. So 30 to 50-ish people seems like a good time to... Basically, you're finding that's when things start to really break down.

Ryan Singer (01:25:05):
That's when they show themselves and I think... I mean, if someone hears this and it all starts to make sense and they're earlier in that wave, then of course the earlier that you can anticipate it, the better, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):
Yeah. That's a good point.

Ryan Singer (01:25:16):
So if you're-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):
When it's too late is when they come out so-

Ryan Singer (01:25:19):
I mainly hear about it when it's too late. That's why they're reaching out-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:22):
Got it. So maybe closer to 30. Okay.

Ryan Singer (01:25:26):
Honestly, I think it starts the first project where, for example, the founding engineer is hands off and then the new hire is taking over responsibility. Or the person who was like sort of founder/CEO is first giving it to a PM to kind of thinking they're going to carry it through. And then, it's not exactly meeting their expectations of what they thought was going to happen. I think that's when those disconnects actually start. It's the first step away from the work where the seeds of all of these problems actually start.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):
I want to talk about Basecamp and how maybe not every company can operate like Basecamp. Before we get there, is there anything else along the lines of Shape Up that you want to add or share?

Ryan Singer (01:26:10):
Yeah. There's one key thing, which is the role of the PM. I think what we see today, out of necessity in a lot of teams, is that the PMs spend a lot of time chasing around inside of the build phase, inside the time box, to try and make sure that people aren't stuck and getting lost in the weeds and try and keep things moving. And it can sometimes be too close to project management rather than product management.

(01:26:43):
And what we see in Shape Up teams when they hit their stride is that the PM moves upstream. So the PM is less busy with, "How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it's getting built?" And they're way more in, "How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?" That really getting the deeper understanding of the business and the problem and the customer domain and like what problem is worth solving and what's even slice of that problem is the valuable slice to argue that we should spend a few weeks on. That's the place where the PMs can really contribute a lot in the Shape Up world. That's kind of what they do, rather than shepherding the process or being a ritual master or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):
That sounds pretty wonderful. I've been doing some thinking about what an AI-oriented world does to the role of PM and it feels like very similar to that actually, where the building now is going to happen for you with AI tooling. And that means the bigger question now is like, "What the hell should I build? And is the thing I've built right and correct and likely to work?" And it feels like this is similar, it's like the PM spending a lot more time upfront thinking through what to build. And then, the building is a lot more hands off. So hands off it gets done in like five minutes when you're just like, "Well, build this thing for me." "There it is."

Ryan Singer (01:28:19):
Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):
Let's see.

Ryan Singer (01:28:22):
I'm also very curious. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):
Oh, man. What a wild time. Okay. Let's talk about Basecamp. I think we talked about this ahead of the podcast that... You want people to know that Basecamp is very unique and not everyone can work the way Basecamp works. Just talk about your insight there and your advice there when people see all this advice coming out of Basecamp.

Ryan Singer (01:28:45):
I got to tell you, I had no idea how unique we were until I was outside and there are so many things. For example, it's a lot of the things that people ask me about that are not in the book that started to reveal those things to me. That's so many things that I was just taking for granted. I mean, every designer codes.

(01:29:05):
Imagine, if every designer codes and I don't just mean HTML. I mean, like running the app locally, going in to the place where that view is rendered to make that thing look the way that they want it to look or whatever, right? I mean, like really codes, every designer. So every designer codes, where's the wall between design and engineering? Where is the moment where you arrive with the Figma file and then the disappointment and all of your hopes get destroyed because the engineer is telling you no, right? Like those moments don't even exist in that world.

(01:29:42):
And then, also, I think also there was this lack of distance between sort of the business objective, the thing that we're trying to... The reason we want to maybe do this project and the blessing of the founders and the... Like, there wasn't this kind of executives far away with some big targets and then some layer of PM and then some building. I mean, the founders were always there, right there in the problem definition still.

(01:30:14):
I mean, I can't say today, but I mean up until 2021 when I was still there. So it meant that there was so much clarity all the time around what we're solving and why and why we're making time for it. And then, of course, on the engineering side as well. I mean, imagine, you have no sales org, you have no marketing. That all of selling and marketing is happening by the unicorn founders. So it means that there isn't contention for engineering time, that there isn't like all these different sources of requests that you have to wrestle with,

(01:30:50):
And David did such an extraordinary job of... I mean, the more I see the real world, the more I'm amazed at how every six weeks, there was clear runway in engineering of like, "We have time for whatever the... Whatever we'd agreed together is the most important thing." Just blank check like six weeks at a time. Not a blank check, but you know what I mean? Like a blank six weeks, yeah?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:15):
Yeah.

Ryan Singer (01:31:16):
Again and again and again, years without end. Keeping that engineering capacity focused on readiness for product and totally leaning into what's exciting to do to build for the product. And not getting lost in all this refactoring and new infrastructure and technical debt and stuff like that. I mean, those are amazing. So those are some really big differences. And it doesn't mean that you have to be Basecamp to do Shape Up. But what it does mean is that when we say, "Oh, just have a shaping session and if you have the pressure of the time box, then you can make trade-offs together." It's like, "Well, if we are used to having a big wall between, for example, engineering and design, then we're going to have to learn..." Somebody who wants to start shaping is going to have to learn like, "Well, oh, I need to figure out who to bring together and how to have that session and how do we interact with each other. So that we are combining all of that knowledge that maybe at Basecamp was all in the same head in a lot of cases."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:18):
This is such an important point for people to hear, because there's so many people that come on podcasts like this and share, "Here's how to do it," based on their experience. And there's so many just assumptions about their resources, the people they hire, the way the founders operate. Like no sales team, I think that's like... I don't even think about that.

Ryan Singer (01:32:36):
Yeah. Imagine, no such thing as a request from sales, yeah? No such thing as pressure of like, "We need this thing in order to upsell or to close this deal." Never.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):
It sounds like you're in this Basecamp... By the way, was it called 37signals? Like it's interesting you call it Basecamp not 37signal.

Ryan Singer (01:32:54):
Yeah. I mean, so it's just like the timing of when I left. We were originally 37signals and then Basecamp became so big that we renamed ourselves to Basecamp.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:03):
I didn't know that.

Ryan Singer (01:33:04):
Yeah. And then, so for example, on the book, it says Shape Up and there's a Basecamp logo on the bottom, not a 37signals logo. But then, since I went back, so it's 37signals again. So I sometimes struggle with I don't know what to call it but it's both. Whatever people can recognize, it's the same powerhouse.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:24):
Okay. Cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's confused. But 37signal is the current name. Great.

Ryan Singer (01:33:29):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:30):
So you said that it felt like you left and it was like this bubble you got out of. Was there like a moment where you're like, "You wrote this book. Everyone..." You're like, "Hey, this is how you should work," and then you're like, "Oh, wait. This doesn't actually work in real life for a lot of people."? Is there a moment there?

Ryan Singer (01:33:44):
It wasn't that this doesn't work, I was just in a foreign country. It was like we tried it and it didn't work. One of the common things I would hear is the projects kept running over. "We weren't finishing them at the end of the cycle. They kept running over and running over." And then, I would be like, "Huh. So can you show me your shaping work?" And then, they would show me a PRD and I'd be like, "That doesn't look like what's in the book." And again like, "Can you show me your shaping work?" And they'd show me like a bunch of Figma files.

(01:34:21):
And then, what I started to understand was like we have some people in a role who were used to making a certain artifact at a certain step and they just kept doing that. And I didn't appreciate... It took me a while to realize like, "There's no engineer in the picture here." And it was when we started to actually do the course, I said... Well, I did actually a couple projects where I helped teams hands-on and I learned that they...

(01:34:50):
It was the first actually consulting project that I did where I helped a team who was stuck. And what we did was we chose the engineer who was best suited to come over to product and be there in the shaping. And that was the moment when it was like, "Ah. Now, I'm in the world I know again," when we had all of that mixed in the same room again. And so, that was kind of like... That was really something... I mean, it was a total learning curve for me and there's a lot of things like that. But that was, for example, a really big one. It's like, "Oh, we have to get engineering in there."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:24):
You're the type of guest I most love having on this podcast, because you basically work with many, many companies, study what's working, what's not. You're not in the clouds pontificating about something. You're working with teams to make things better. And then, you take all of that learning, put it into a book, and share with us all. And so, the ROI is just incredible for us all because you've spent so much time doing this and you've actually done the work. You're not just in theory about it. So this is amazing. But we're not done yet. One question I wanted to ask is, Jason was tweeting that there's... He's working on a follow-up Shape Up book. What's happening there? Are you involved in that? What's the story?

Ryan Singer (01:36:06):
So I also saw the tweet. And I have to admit, I was a little surprised when I saw this tweet, but I had had a conversation with Jason a year earlier. And he reached out and he said, "Hey, we're thinking about doing a second edition of the book." And my first reaction... Imagine, I was actually really in the middle of learning all these things that teams need to learn in order to catch up to what was natural for Basecamp to do. And so, for me, it was like, "Interesting. I have a lot of new things. I have a lot of new ideas. Maybe collaborating on the second edition could make sense."

(01:36:46):
But what I understood was that what he wanted to do was to make an updated version of how they work, because that's always been a big thing of how... I should use the right name, 37signals, of how they market and also how they lead is they like to really show a clear example. Not like, "This is how you could do it. This is how some people do it," but like, "This is how we do it."

(01:37:09):
And I think it's their strength that they are very, very clear like, "This is how we do it and take it or leave it." What I understood was that if I did another version of the book that was just how Basecamp does it, I think it would leave so much opportunity on the table. Like there's so many people where what they need to learn is more like, "How can it come closer to where I am? If I have the wall today between product and engineering, how do I bring the right people together into a shaping session? How do we actually do that? How do I overcome all of these little challenges because this is so far from our current way of working?"

(01:37:44):
So the work that I'm doing with, for example, with shaping in real life is all about those gaps. And then, I don't know what's going to be in the second edition because they are... I guess someone there is going to be working on that. But what I'm guessing is it's going to be an update on kind of, "Up on top of the mountain over here, this is what Basecamp is doing." So hopefully, it'll be a cool thing to look at as like, "Here's a model of what they're doing." And then the question is, "What can I take from that and what do I need in order to actually be able to make it work in the real situation I'm in?" And that's kind of where... Well, that's my focus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:20):
This is so interesting. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a fork. You forked it and these are going potentially in different directions but inspired by each other.

Ryan Singer (01:38:29):
Mm-hmm. Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:30):
So interesting. Ryan, is there anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?

Ryan Singer (01:38:37):
One thing I could throw out there is sometimes people reach out to me because their projects aren't shipping, there's a lot of struggle, there's a lot of lack of clarity. But the root cause is actually that the input at the very beginning of the process is too unclear or... Like we don't actually know what's important to customers or we're not actually sure where the value is or this kind of a thing. So there is this link, this framing step that we talked about of, "What is really the problem?", before we go into shaping.

(01:39:11):
This is the link to product strategy also. And this is the place where it can be really useful to reach for a lot of, for example, Bob Moesta stuff with the Jobs-to-be-Done and the demand-side work, trying to get clear about big... So that's the tool that I reach for at that phase. And you can think of kind of this... Before the problem definition, there's this question of like, "What's the demand? Where are people struggling? Where is really the place, the itch they're trying to scratch?

(01:39:42):
And then, a lot of the Shape Up stuff is kind of when I have something where I think there's an opportunity or I think there's something meaningful there because of what we learned from customers or the job to be done, research, or whatever it was. Now, how do I turn that into something that we can actually go do and ship in a reasonable amount of time? That's the supply side. That's where the Shape Up part fits in. So maybe it just might be cool for people to see a link there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:06):
That's a great plug for a Bob Moesta episode. We talked in-depth about the Jobs-to-be-Done framework and how to actually apply it. What's the book you'd recommend there? It sounds like basically it's like Shape Up plus this book gives you a lot.

Ryan Singer (01:40:19):
Actually, the one that I recommend the most is Demand-Side Sales 101 and it's funny because it's like sales. Especially for a product person, you're like, "I'm the product person, not the sales person." But it's such a good dive into, "What are people really trying to solve?" And getting into that mindset of, "What's the struggle? What's the problem?" I think that's a really good entry point for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:43):
Yeah. I don't love that title. I feel like you could have done better there with that book's title because-

Ryan Singer (01:40:48):
It's-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:49):
Yeah.

Ryan Singer (01:40:50):
What's interesting about it is that it's very, very pointy for like if you are trying to make progress on sales, then it's this other kind of sales, this demand side sales. So I think maybe it's more for us who are kind of using it for different purposes. Like we're the product people trying to pull something out of it. That it's a little bit less aligned, but it's still useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):
Yeah. But basically it's like the Jobs-to-be-Done book is what-

Ryan Singer (01:41:15):
Yeah. It's kind of like the Jobs-to-be-Done book that's a bit more tactical. If you're really curious about the general spirit of Jobs-to-be-Done, then Competing Against Luck is a really good intro. That's the one that Clay Christensen wrote with a lot of... I think there's a lot of stuff that Bob worked on that's in there. But for a little bit more tactical like, "What's it look like to do the interview? And how to think about the struggling moment?" and stuff like that, this Demand-Side Sales is good for this strategy stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:44):
Awesome. And we'll also link to this episode where you could get the gist of it in one hour's time.

Ryan Singer (01:41:48):
Oh, that's right. You did... That episode was great by the way. That's... Yeah-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:52):
Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan. Okay. We did it. This was amazing. I think this is going to help so many people-

Ryan Singer (01:41:58):
We got through it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:58):
We're not done yet. Two final questions for you. Where can folks find the book, find you if they want to work with you? Anything else that you want to share? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Ryan Singer (01:42:08):
Well, they can find me at my website. That's ryansinger.co. I'm also on X on RJS. I'm on LinkedIn. So just reach me there. And how can people be useful to me? I love hearing from people who are having these problems. If you're having these problems where it's like, "Things are dragging," or, "We can't see the end and we're not getting the quality we need," and all this stuff like man. I mean, this is how I learned all this stuff is by talking to people who are in it. So even if it's not clear what's the next step yet. If that problem is real, it would be cool to hear about it. I'd love to chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:46):
Be careful what you wish for about Moesta. He was just on the podcast and he told me he's got over a hundred LinkedIn DMs with people sharing their struggles with their job search. So here you go.

Ryan Singer (01:42:57):
Oh, yeah. Job moves, that's a big one. I think that's a broad appeal. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:01):
Yeah. That's true. I'm going to ask you to explain that when you do consulting work, just like how does that work? Who's that for? Just because I know that's something else you do.

Ryan Singer (01:43:10):
So it basically starts with uh, either often first CPO or CTO often reaches out first. And when it works well is when we actually get them together and then they understand that they need to change something or we have like a head of product and a head of engineering, that kind of a thing. If those two are both seeing eye to eye that there's a problem, then we can start a conversation around, "Okay. So who would be the right people for a pilot team? What are the things that are going on business-wise that could be a good pilot project?"

(01:43:41):
And then, I can help to figure out like, "How do we actually..." So almost like guiding through, like narrowing down that pilot project framing so that they have the support that it's going to be successful in shaping. And then, coaching the team so that they actually learn those shaping skills so that they can get through a session and come out with much more clarity. Like how do they actually run those sessions.

(01:44:03):
So it's kind of first working with leadership, "Who do we need to get to do this work? Who are the right people? How do we bring them into a pilot project?" Narrowing down, doing some framing work on the pilot, so it's going to be clearer in the shaping. And then, giving some guidance on how to get through that shaping with some feedback rounds. This is usually a good approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):
Amazing. And they can find this on your website if they want to explore this?

Ryan Singer (01:44:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:26):
Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here.

Ryan Singer (01:44:29):
Yeah. Thanks a lot. You had amazing questions. It's a subject that can go in so many directions and you kept bringing us onto some kind of a main track, so I'm really pleased. It was really nice. Thanks a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:39):
I do my best.

Ryan Singer (01:44:39):
Yeah.

# Building Substack | Sachin Monga (Substack, Facebook)

## Transcript

Sachin Monga (00:00:00):
I really think that we're just starting into this golden era of what it might mean to be a writer on the internet. The economic model for supporting great writing on the internet has been generally pretty terrible for the entirety of the internet's history. In the early days of Substack, there's a couple of these glimmers of hope where you'd have people like Matt Taibbi or Bill Bishop, some of the early writers on Substack that were really well established writers who were clearly just being undervalued and now could come to Substack and see their true value.

Sachin Monga (00:00:33):
And that was awesome. That was really cool to see. But in the last year or so, even in the last few months, I think there's been so many really interesting success stories now from writers who might not even consider themselves writers. People who are able to make a living, maybe even make a fortune just doing great work and not needing to have millions and millions of viewers or play the attention games of other networks, but just do really high quality work and have a relatively small number of people value it highly enough to pay for it.

Lenny (00:01:07):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Sachin Monga, who is currently the head of product at Substack. Before Substack, he had a startup called Cocoon that he sold to Substack. And before that, he spent over seven years at Facebook working on the video and camera products, building out the developer platform, and leading the ads growth team. In our conversation, we dig into all things Substack, what it's like to build product at Substack, how different it is to work at a startup versus a big company like Facebook, the future of the Substack product.

Lenny (00:01:42):
We also spent a lot of time on what I venture to say will go down in history as one of the most legendary growth features ever created, the Substack recommendations feature. Substack as a product and a company has changed my life and allowed me to do the work that I do now, and it was such a treat to be able to chat with Sachin. I hope that you find this conversation as interesting as I did. With that, I bring you Sachin Monga. Who has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them.

Lenny (00:02:18):
But if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises but for small teams as well. And as you scale, your company Retool scales with you.

Lenny (00:02:54):
Snowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency. Maybe you've thought about using Retool before, but just haven't and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at Retool.com/lenny.

Sachin Monga (00:04:36):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:37):
I'm actually really excited to have you on. I've told you this before, I've told the founders before, Substack has changed my life in so many ways. There's no way that I would be doing what I'm doing now if not for Substack and just like the magical combination of features that you all built. I'm also just really curious about how you all build the platform, where it's going, how it all works behind the scenes. Again, thank you for being here.

Sachin Monga (00:05:01):
I'm so happy to be here, and that's so great to hear.

Lenny (00:05:03):
Just to set a little context for folks, can you just talk about how you got to Substack? You're currently head of product at Substack. What was that journey to Substack?

Sachin Monga (00:05:12):
I joined Substack around a year ago now exactly through an acquisition. I'd started a company called Cocoon about three years prior to that with my good friend Alex Cornell. Cocoon is not like Substack. It was essentially a little photo sharing app for close friends and family, but there is a common thread which led us to Substack, which was prior to starting Cocoon, Alex and I had both worked at Facebook for a number of years and had worked on effectively the same problem of helping people share more with their friends and family and had all these ideas for what an idealized experience might look like.We just kept running into the wall that you run into when ultimately advertising is the business model that is powering this whole thing, and what that means is you need to accumulate a lot of time spent and attention and convert that into basically sellable eyeballs. But it's not that hard to imagine what a better solution would be. It's just that ads as the business model made it really hard to pull that off. Cocoon was in a lot of ways like a journey to explore what that might look like for this one particular use case of just helping you feel close to a handful of people.

Sachin Monga (00:06:14):
We always looked up to Substack as a really good example of basically that same principle, which is if you imagine rewiring the internet around paid subscriptions, direct subscriptions between, in Substack's case, readers and writers, what could that unlock and could it unlock a clearly better user experience? We looked at Substack as a real inspiration and an example of that really working out and got to know the founders pretty well and had a few conversations and realized that even though the blogging software and the photo sharing app are pretty different, our underlying motivations were really consistent.

Sachin Monga (00:06:46):
It was a bit of a match made in heaven and the whole team joined Substack a year ago. I've been privileged enough to get to lead the product and design teams, and it's been a blast so far.

Lenny (00:06:57):
Before your startup, you're at Facebook for a number of years, is that right?

Sachin Monga (00:07:00):
Yes. I started in 2011 there on the growth team and had the chance to work on a bunch of different teams there, growth, platform, ads, and then eventually the team we called Sharing, which was helping people share more in the main Facebook app.

Lenny (00:07:12):
Sweet. I want to spend a little time on that, but coming back to Substack, I'm curious just how the product team runs. How many PMs do y'all have? How is it structured? How are you thinking it'll evolve as you scale? What can you share there?

Sachin Monga (00:07:25):
Sure. Maybe to start from when I started at Substack, we had zero PMs. We had a handful of designers. We had maybe 15 or so engineers. I think we're coming to the close of this kind of one-time inflection point of becoming a product driven company and having a product process and structure and PMs and full stack product teams. When I started at Substack, there was really not much of this. We're still pretty early, but we have something going now.

Sachin Monga (00:07:51):
We have four product managers in addition to myself, and we have three essentially kind of full stack product teams now that have a PM and an engineering manager, a data person or a designer, engineers and things are starting to roll. We're finally emerging from this transition phase and it's been super fun.

Lenny (00:08:10):
What are these three teams?

Sachin Monga (00:08:11):
The three teams are: we have a writer team that serves writers, we have a reader team that serves readers, and we have a growth team that does growthy things. I should mention, we have a fourth engineering team that's like the systems team that doesn't have a product manager on it, but is keeping the lights on and helping us scale.

Lenny (00:08:28):
Awesome. That makes sense. You currently align it around the type of user plus the platform stuff. Do you have a sense of where this might evolve over the next few years just structure wise? Do you think it'll stick to that? Do you have a plan of how this might radically shift as you grow?

Sachin Monga (00:08:43):
Yeah. I'm actually kind of shocked that it's lasted this long and stayed consistent. I remember at Facebook, we would change our team structure what felt like every three months or six months and just have a reorg every once in a while. Part of why I think it's remained pretty consistent is exactly what you mentioned, which is the teams aren't oriented around product surfaces. We don't have a team that's like the app team or a team that's like the dashboard team or the podcasting team. We have teams that are oriented around customers and solving bit of a timeless customer problem. We'll never be done serving writers.

Sachin Monga (00:09:16):
We just started honestly having a concerted focus on serving readers. Growth is never a problem that you check the box off on. I hope that we are able to maintain this general structure. I think as Substack grows and expands, I'm sure we'll have more than three teams. This is where we're at right now, but I really like the focus on a customer and a timeless mission really rather than orienting around what might be a bit more of an ephemeral surface area or product de jour.

Lenny (00:09:46):
Awesome. Shout out to the writer team. Thanks for building all the awesome stuff that I get to use. It makes sense why you are more recently investing in the reader team because Substack has this magical advantage platforms have where your supply drives all your demand. I go out and promote my newsletter, people sign up for Substack. It makes sense why there's not initially a huge focus on the demand growth, but makes sense to get there. It sounds like your app is awesome.

Lenny (00:10:11):
One thing I wanted to touch on is you're kind of in this interesting position as a head of product at a small-ish company with a founder who's very product sense strong, and that's a classic challenge for a product leader to be in, where it's a smallish company, either a first PM or even a head of product, where the founder's very opinionated about the product. I'm curious what you've learned about how to work in that environment as a PM.

Sachin Monga (00:10:36):
That's a great question. I don't know if I have the recipe for this, but I can just maybe share a few of the things that come to mind. I think the first thing was really treating my role in the beginning more as a facilitator than a decision maker when it comes to product. I think the team was also small enough that everyone in theory could have a good sense of what everyone else was up to. A specific problem we had I think when I joined was that we were just getting to the point where we wouldn't have one weekly meeting where Chris could be in the room, Chris is the CEO of Substack and the person you're mentioning, and decide what we're doing in the next two weeks.

Sachin Monga (00:11:13):
We were just emerging from that phase. We had this problem which was all of a sudden, Chris didn't really know what all the teams were doing and the teams didn't really know what Chris had in mind for what they should do and what the vision was. We were hiring really quickly and hiring people who might not have all of the context of being in the room with him for years and being in all of the all-hands meetings. When I first joined, I felt like my main role was actually just solving that. And if nothing else, if Chris could have a really good sense of what all the teams are doing and if the teams knew where he was coming from and could start to get better at modeling him and his vision, that would be a win.

Sachin Monga (00:11:43):
For the first couple months I'd say, that was all I tried to do. I think now Chris and I have some reps under our belt and the teams have some reps under their belts too, and that trust just starts to form. We start the week, Chris and I, we sit down for an hour. We go through what do we feel like are the big problems to focus on this week, what are the things we're worried about. We sit down at the end of the week and we check in again. There's just a lot of open communication. I think that helps a lot.

Lenny (00:12:07):
Got it. It sounds like the core of this is building trust, which makes sense. The way that you've been building trust, one is just do it again and again and then Chris starts to trust, "Okay, Sachin's going to do the things that I think are probably the right things." And then you said you have this weekly meeting. Is there anything else that either tactically you find as a really important component of this relationship or any other lessons you've learned about just how to keep this relationship healthy and constructive?

Sachin Monga (00:12:34):
One thing that I think about a little bit because like any startup, there's going to be times that are really difficult, times that are really fun. Substack is certainly going through this really transformative time, but we're really evolving in a lot of ways from a tool into a network. We're in the thick of seeing this vision through in a lot of ways Chris has had in his mind for five years. We did a thing at an all-hands a little while ago where Substack went through Y Combinator I think it was maybe now six years ago and we watched the 60 second demo they pitched from 2017.

Sachin Monga (00:13:04):
What was so cool about that was we're actually doing all those things now that Chris got up on stage and talked about like, "One day in the future, Substack is going to get into podcasting, and we're going to have this network effect that helps writers grow by virtue of there being other writers in the platform." There's all these things that we kind of couldn't do until we earned our place at the table and the right to be able to do those things that we're doing now. To go back to your question, I think a thing that I really try to be mindful of right now is, how do I catch up?

Sachin Monga (00:13:35):
Chris has been thinking about this problem for five times as long as I have. If I can get a good sense of where his vision starts from and catch up those few years and help the teams do the same, that'll go a long way. Because at the same time, everyone now is coming at it from a different perspective. We've a lot more data and evidence. It's really good to have people on the team that have come from other companies and comply that perspective. It's a lot of, again, facilitation and I view that as a big part of my role.

Lenny (00:14:01):
Awesome. I'm curious, what are the biggest challenges with being in the position you're in? Are there any examples of a man that sucked? Or if you want to go in a different direction, is there a certain type of person that just isn't a good fit for this kind of role, had a product at a smallish company with a very product minded founder?

Sachin Monga (00:14:19):
Oh, let's start with the first one. I think the biggest challenge with this role/company phase, like I mentioned, we're going through this one-time transition from not really having a product function or a product process to having one, is almost by definition any time you figure out how to do a thing, you'll now reach this next phase of growth and it'll be obsolete. Something that I've repeated a bunch of the teams is I'm never too worried if we have the perfect planning process or the perfect execution cadence or the perfect communication process, whatever our process is, we're never going to have a perfect one.

Sachin Monga (00:14:52):
And even if we did, it would soon be obsolete because we did a really good job and now we've grown 2X or something and we have more people and the process needs to change. The main thing I care about is are we just getting better every week, every month, certainly every year. I think that's easier said than done. It sounds good in theory, but then when you're in the thick of it. you're constantly basically feeling like you don't know how to do the thing. Because as soon as you figure it out, it's obsolete. It's just really hard. I think that's true of basically just startups in general, high growth companies. Doing the thing well means that you're not going to know what you're doing.

Sachin Monga (00:15:24):
Maybe that leads into my answer to the second question, which is that's not really for everyone. I think there's almost like a personality type that has to be okay with being humbled all the time and feeling like you don't know what you're doing. I think you could be an amazing product manager at a company that is a bit more stable and consistent and get really good at what you're doing and someone who's going to be really good at a company that is on a bit of this trajectory, for folks who aren't watching the video, making a motion with my hand, that's not growing too fast, it's kind of a different job. The rate of change is a huge factor.

Lenny (00:16:03):
The point you made about how things are going to keep changing as you grow is such an important point that I don't feel like comes up as much as I thought would come up on this podcast. People are always asking me for advice. How do I structure my product team? How do I prioritize? How do I do planning? The main thing I've learned is no matter what you end up with, it's going to change in three to six months anyway because you'll learn more. The advice is just do the best thing you can think of right now. Don't assume this will last anyway, and that's good enough. There's never the perfect way to do it. It's always the best way you could do it at this moment, and then you learn how to evolve it.

Sachin Monga (00:16:35):
100% agree.

Lenny (00:16:37):
You worked at Facebook for I think it was seven years. I'm curious what were you able to take from that experience about how Facebook, in a massive company like that, builds product to a smaller company like Substack. What translates well and then what just doesn't?

Sachin Monga (00:16:51):
Over time, I'm finding that less translates than I thought. I don't know how much of that has to do with Facebook specifically though. I'll maybe mention one thing. Working on the core Facebook app, which was what I was working on for the bulk of my time there, Facebook may be the most extreme example of trying to solve so many different problems for so many different people in one tiny rectangle basically, that a big part of the product manager's job in a situation like that is going to be managing trade-offs. It's a super fascinating intellectual problem.

Sachin Monga (00:17:22):
I think going back to the previous point, a lot of people really thrive in that kind of environment, where if we do this thing really well, it is going to directly trade-off against doing this other thing. It's not even a sequencing thing. When you think about prioritization, sometimes you think, we will do this, and then we'll do this, and then we'll do this. In Facebook's case, sometimes it's, "Oh, if we do this, we just can't do this. It's going to be bad for this other thing. If we put a watch tab at the bottom, will that mean that people don't get a marketplace tab? What does that mean for this whole org and what the product is?" I think when it comes to something like prioritization, it's a very different ballgame.

Sachin Monga (00:17:56):
There's certainly some things that are consistent. You generally want to prioritize things that are going to be high impact, low effort. These types of product management frameworks, I think a lot of it can hold constant. But when you really get into the object level like what does your day look like, I think being a PM at a high growth... I can't generalize this, but the job at Substack right now, it looks quite different than what I recognized as my job from Facebook circa 2018. I think it's maybe even gotten more the case that the PM's job in a situation like that will be navigating these types of internal trade-offs. I think on something like prioritization, very different.

Lenny (00:18:31):
Just to double click on that a little bit, the main difference you're saying is that at a Facebook, it's not like whether we do a thing, it's just like what comes first, second, third. At a Substack, it's like we probably won't get to this for a year if we don't prioritize it now. Is that how you think about it, just like the time scale on your trade-offs?

Sachin Monga (00:18:46):
No. I think actually at Facebook, it's not necessarily whether we do a thing. It's not like we do this now or we do this later. It's doing this thing might mean we can't do this other thing at all, or it'll mean that instead of that chart being steady until we make the number go up, it might go down. By doing A, it might mean B is harder to do forever. Whereas at a startup, a lot of it is time. Time is the main variable. We can do this now and that means that we can't do this other thing until later. There's also an element of sequencing that matters I think a lot at a company like Substack that is in this formative stage of becoming an entirely new thing in a lot of ways.

Sachin Monga (00:19:21):
Substack started off like a single player tool for writers. It was like software for writers. If you describe Substack now as simply a newsletter tool, that would be reductive. It's really now much more of this ecosystem that's evolving in all sorts of interesting ways. There is a bit of an order of operations at play here where doing something right now might unlock our ability to do something later. That matters a lot in a situation like we're in at Substack.

Lenny (00:19:49):
Got it. Essentially there's a lot more one-way doors at a larger company. Here, you can make decisions more quickly partly, but also you can go back and there's not all these second order effects of decision you're making.

Sachin Monga (00:20:00):
I think that's right, or at least there are different types of second order effects.

Lenny (00:20:03):
Got it. I know at Substack writers are like the beacon and the vision of making writers successful, helping people make a living writing. I imagine writers are the North Star or helping writers be successful, but is there anything where you can share about how you prioritize things that you work on within Substack? How do you think about the North Star?

Sachin Monga (00:20:20):
Going back to your question about Chris too, I think Chris and Hamish and Jay, the founders I think really start from a place of principle in a lot of ways. Why are we even doing this thing? It's not just to help writers make money. It's not just to unlock these cool things. It starts with an opinion for how the internet should work, where people should be in control over their destiny to a much greater extent than has ever really been the case over at least the last 10, 15 years, where all of a sudden, everyone just started spending all of their time in a handful of these public squares that were powered by ads.

Sachin Monga (00:20:57):
When you think about what that means for Substack right now, that that means writers are in control over being able to deliver their best work on their terms to their audience, make money directly from their subscribers, and also that readers should be in control over their experience. When you show up to Substack.com, that experience should be something that you have a much greater degree of agency over or if you download the app than if you maybe opened up TikTok or something.

Sachin Monga (00:21:20):
I think where that leads you down from a prioritization standpoint is often starting from, okay, if we could do something in a bunch of different ways, is there a way that provides more control to the writer or more control over the experience that the reader has to them? Is there a way that provides much less control? All things equal, do the one that holds constant this principle of control. We could talk about a few other examples like this, but I think from a prioritization standpoint and from a strategic standpoint, Substack is a pretty principled company, and I think it's been really fun and interesting to get to work in an environment like this and also see how it actually can work.

Sachin Monga (00:21:57):
You are excited about recommendations, the recommendations feature, and we can talk about that in more detail. I think that's a good example where there's certainly a way to do that where writers have the max amount of control. We picked that way even if it might seem harder to pull off. And then that feedback loop of, "Oh, that actually worked," is really awesome to get to experience.

Lenny (00:22:17):
Yes, I definitely wanted to talk about this recommendation feature. I feel like it's maybe the most underappreciated radical shift in Substack and just platforms in general. I think this is going to go down as one of the most legendary impactful features of any platform or marketplace. I'm just putting this out there. It's such a huge deal and I don't think people appreciate this. Just to quickly summarize what this is, essentially you allowed writers like me to recommend other newsletters that I specifically pick. I pick 10 newsletters that I think are awesome. Once someone subscribes to my newsletter, they see these 10 as, "Hey, you should check these out. I think these are awesome."

Lenny (00:22:55):
It's very curated. There's no algorithm involved, which to your point is Substack's I think vision and mission is just avoid algorithms as much as possible. The reason I think this is crazy and amazing is at this point, 70% of my growth is coming from this one feature. There's something like 500 other newsletters recommending me. As soon as the feature launched and you look at my growth chart, it's just a hockey stick starting that day. I don't think people appreciate this enough, and I'm really excited to just chat about how this feature came to be.

Lenny (00:23:26):
Coming back to a point we talked about earlier of Chris having a very strong opinion about how to build product, something I heard through a birdie is that Chris was not excited about this feature when it was proposed and it took a bit of pushing to get it out. Maybe we start there. How did this come to be?

Sachin Monga (00:23:39):
Sure. The way it came to be was that we noticed this organic behavior emerging, which was that a lot of readers of Substacks were starting to discover Substacks, but the way that was happening was typically through the lens of that original writer. This could happen in a bunch of different ways, right? I think you've used the guest post feature to have guests write post on your newsletter. Obviously that is a really good way for your readers to go and discover some of these other writers in a way that you're curating. There's some less obvious ways that this happens too.

Sachin Monga (00:24:10):
If you have comments on, which I think you do, if I scroll down and click on the profile of someone who's commenting on your post, it'll show me the other Substack that person reads too. Again, this is a very personalized and very writer centric way of doing discovery. At the same time, we talked about the supply and demand side of the marketplace. The supply side of Substack has just grown over time consistently to the point where now there's a huge amount of amazing writers on the platform and a huge number of collective readers on the platform too that we knew that this sort of like cross-pollination, this discovery loop could be a really powerful thing.

Sachin Monga (00:24:47):
If you'd start from the first principles, you're like, "All right, how do we help readers discover more things?' The most obvious way to do this would be something like, "Here are some Substacks you might. Based on what we know about your reading habits, here's like a few that Substack is just going to recommend you." This is the thing that worked really well. At Facebook in particular, I think when I joined in 2011, it was definitely still during the era... I think Facebook maybe had just over 500 million users and was on this path to a billion and beyond.

Sachin Monga (00:25:13):
This thing that we called PYMK, which was People You May Know, this little unit that would show up in the newsfeed and it would just tell you that eight other people that you obviously know because you have million mutual friends. That kind of thing drove a very non-trivial amount of Facebook growth in the early days. Of course, lots of other products have done things like this. We could have done something like that.

Sachin Monga (00:25:32):
But then going back to that principle of like, okay, well, if we were to do that, let's say we were to insert it at the bottom of our post or in an email or something, it's clearly a thing now where the writer who owns that space is not really in control over what the experiences that they're offering their readers. The reader who signed up for Lenny is now seeing these other things that have nothing to do with Lenny. Does that break this control principle, like putting writers in charge, putting readers in charge? Okay, so then back to the drawing board, what would be the most obvious maximal way to just put writers in control? What is the simplest version of this?

Sachin Monga (00:26:05):
What if we just ask writers, who do you recommend? What if we just put that in the subscribe flow and just made it as simple as possible? I think Chris' reaction to that originally when that idea came up was that's probably just going to be really hard to pull off. There's a lot more things that have to be true. You need writers to opt in. You need to pick good people. You need to find a way to surface those recommendations to the readers in a way that's going to generate a good amount of surface area. I think it was a bit of skepticism that something like that could work, but we tried it and it took off really quickly.

Sachin Monga (00:26:39):
There was this virality at play now where when you recommend a bunch of people, those people will get an email that say, "Hey, Lenny's recommending you and here's all the readers that he's sending you." It created this goodwill viral loop, which was really interesting to see play out. I think there was a bunch of interesting lessons in there. We could stick into anything that seems interesting, but I think Chris' skepticism was not, should we do cross-pollination discovery? Clearly this is something that's working, but is this kind of thing going to work given how many steps are required for it to be true that this becomes really impactful? It turned out that it took off way faster than I think we had imagined.

Lenny (00:27:13):
Is there any stats you can share about just the impact it's having, what it's done to Substack?

Sachin Monga (00:27:17):
Yeah, sure. Recommendations specifically now have driven in the millions of new subscriptions for writers across the board, across I think like tens of thousands of unique writers that have received subscriptions from the recommendations feature. Of course, recommendations in particular are still just one component in this broader basket of network driven discovery.

Sachin Monga (00:27:39):
I think we recently shared the stat, more than one in three new subscriptions across Substack are coming from the Substack network and around one in 10 paid subscriptions now too. But these numbers are just, as you can imagine, growing up and to the right, getting stronger every day, and I think we'll have some more interesting stats to share on that soon.

Lenny (00:27:58):
Awesome. One thing I wanted to acknowledge, I think some people worry about this feature that it drives lower intent users. I find that not to be true. They're definitely lower intent, but it's not meaningfully and significantly. The fact that 70% of my user growth comes from this feature and my open rates have only come down a little bit, it says a lot about it. It's like useful really in tenfold people as much as it can be from someone that hasn't actually been planning to subscribe and just recently found out about it. It's really impressive how high intent they are all things considered.

Sachin Monga (00:28:31):
You bring up a point too that leads into some of the next things we're thinking about here, which is that right now most of the subscriptions that come from recommendations are coming from one particular flow in the product, which is when someone subscribes to someone else on Substack, they will then see a recommendation for Lenny. It's being serviced to people at a moment where not only are they just hearing about you for the first time, but they might just be hearing about the recommending writer for the first time too. They are new subscribers. They don't have this long standing trusted relationship built up yet.

Sachin Monga (00:29:04):
Of course, you have people now who've been subscribing to you for years and who trust you greatly and would probably take your recommendation very seriously, but the people that you're recommending are only getting these subscribers at the first moment that someone finds out about Lenny in many cases. A big part of the next step of this product now is thinking about recommendations less as a step of the flow and more like a really interesting social graph that is being built of goodwill and of influence. You now recommend a bunch of other writers. There's much more that could be done in the network than just show some of those writers in the subscribe flow of lennysnewsletter.com.

Sachin Monga (00:29:43):
There's a lot more we could do there. I'm curious if you have any ideas, but we've got a bunch of ideas that we're cooking up that I think will not only drive more subscriptions, but also probably higher intent ones as well, because these are going to be people that might already have been reading you for years who never right now would know who you're recommending.

Lenny (00:29:58):
No great ideas to share. I do find since it's only free subscribers, I have to do more work to upsell them to try paid. On the other hand, having a huge pool of interested people that aren't ready to convert yet is only beneficial. When I send a free post and mention, "Hey, I have a paid subscription. You can get more," it works really well.

Lenny (00:30:17):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

Lenny (00:30:56):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Lenny (00:31:34):
Something else I'll mention that I've learned to do is I feel so fortunate being early on Substack and having this thing grow so much, especially from this recommendation feature that I'm actually getting pings from people regularly now of, "Hey, can you recommend my newsletter?" It's like a really good growth hack on Substack right now to try to get a lot of subscribers to recommend you. My system right now is I want to share the wealth as much as I can, so I rotate through different newsletters.

Lenny (00:31:59):
I help get them say a thousand subscribers, and then move on to the next one, assuming I like them. It's not just any random user. So I can share the wealth with a lot of different newsletters and give people a platform, because I have this platform now and that's been working really well.

Sachin Monga (00:32:12):
The Robin Hood of Substack.

Lenny (00:32:14):
Yeah, now I'm going to get all these DMs to recommend people. If I'm unable to, I'm sorry. You talked about how Chris was worried that this would not work. That's interesting. His point of there's so many steps that have to happen for this to be adopted is such a good one. In my experience, getting users to do anything is so hard. To get them to click some buttons and fill things out, that rarely works. It's cool that it really did work.

Lenny (00:32:38):
I think it was part of the early beta, and I found that it was a really thoughtful approach to how it was all rolled out where there was a small group of users and writers that tried it out, see how went, see what the impact was, see if there was any negative impact. Is there anything you could share by just the way this was rolled out that you've learned about how to do this sort of thing?

Sachin Monga (00:32:56):
I mentioned that we're going through this one-time transition of figuring out how to become a product driven company and how to ship products faster, better, et cetera. One of the principles I guess in this playbook that we're trying to write is we call it build with writers, build with readers. In some ways now that I think about it, it's almost like a sub principle of the put readers in charge, put writers in charge. How do you build product responsibly if you care deeply about that? One way to do it would be to almost as a strong default, anytime we're going to make a fundamental change to how Substack works, do it in a way where we bring writers along.

Sachin Monga (00:33:32):
This is still an optional thing. This isn't changing how Substack works for everyone, but this is we think a potentially profound enough thing that the way we did this was not just roll it out for everyone, put a little dialogue in the dashboard that says, "Hey, everyone, now go do this thing," it was like, okay, why don't we call up 10 writers who we think might be interested in this." It's not that hard to just mock up what this could look like, get some feedback. This is the kind of thing that I think a lot of product teams would do. But then maybe a lot of product teams would be like, "Okay, we got good feedback. Let's just build the thing, ship the thing."

Sachin Monga (00:33:59):
Instead, we just ran a little pilot. You and a few other writers were gracious enough to lend your time and talk us through how you would see this working and what you would want. We actually have now we've set up something called the Product Lab, which I'm really excited about. I think you're a part of it. I hope we asked you.

Lenny (00:34:16):
I'm curious to see where this all goes.

Sachin Monga (00:34:19):
This is just an invite only little group of a hundred or so writers that we know are interested in being on the bleeding edge of what Substack is becoming. We're investing a lot in just tools to help writers grow. Now we've got this little lab where we can take a feature recommendations to writers and get quick feedback and ensure that we're never just rolling something out to everyone without going through this step first. It's just been super helpful to have a bit of this infrastructure in place. Often the thing that we end up shipping on day one tends to be pretty different from what we had in mind before we went through this process.

Lenny (00:34:54):
I've been through a bunch of those experiences and it always goes super well. I've been through a few features that just didn't go anywhere and then they, "Nope, we're going to move on and not try this thing." Something else that always comes to mind with Substack is it's often in the news. Substack is a very popular topic amongst reporters.

Sachin Monga (00:35:10):
Writers like to talk about writers.

Lenny (00:35:11):
That's right, especially a platform that might disrupt them someday or friends have gone on and they're maybe jealous about. I'm curious, as a product leader, how you deal with bad press, angry attention, things like that, just keeping people focused, keeping people motivated. Do you discuss stuff? How do you approach stuff that comes out of like, "Oh man," and keep people excited?

Sachin Monga (00:35:33):
The whole thing here is just parsing out the signal from the noise. There's very little chatter in the blogosphere media sphere that would actually impact our day-to-day when I think about it. It's not zero, right? Sometimes there'll be something that ends up blowing up or that people are talking about that we should really take seriously and see how that might impact our strategy. But I'd say 90% of the chatter about Substack is going to probably ultimately just be a distraction to our product team at the end of the day that should just be focused on executing on the vision.

Sachin Monga (00:36:02):
Maybe my skin got thickened from working at Facebook during a bunch of years that... Actually when I started at Facebook, generally things were quite rosy in the press, but we certainly went through a bunch of different phases and a lot of the stuff. I worked on myself that Facebook ended up getting talked about a ton in the press negatively most of the time. You just learn to just keep your heads down and keep shipping. Ultimately, that's all that matters. I feel proud of the way that I think our culture is internally being formed right now. We tend to not get distracted.

Lenny (00:36:37):
It seems to be the case. I'm curious where you see Substack going as a product long-term. What are you excited about? Where are things heading?

Sachin Monga (00:36:45):
Maybe I'll answer that in two parts, one from a writer centric lens and one from a reader centric lens, which I mentioned is a bit of a newer thing for us. From a writer centric lens, I really think that we're just starting into this golden era of what it might mean to be a writer on the internet. Like I mentioned before, the economic model for supporting great writing on the internet has been generally pretty terrible for the entirety of the internet's history.

Sachin Monga (00:37:13):
In the early days of Substack, there's a couple of these glimmers of hope where you'd have people like Matt Taibbi or Bill Bishop, some of the early writers on Substack that were really well established writers who were clearly just being undervalued and now could come to Substack and see their true value. That was awesome. That was really cool to see. But in the last year or so, even in the last few months, I think there's been so many really interesting success stories now from writers who might not even consider themselves writers, let alone well established writers like Matt Taibbi or someone like that.

Sachin Monga (00:37:46):
People who are able to make a living, maybe even make a fortune just doing great work and not needing to have millions and millions of viewers or play the attention games of other networks, but just do really high quality work and have a relatively small number of people value it highly enough to pay for it. That's like a new thing. When I see the next one to two years play out for the writer side of the equation, a lot of what we're going to try to do is just make it much simpler to get started, to have your Substack.

Sachin Monga (00:38:15):
If you have an audience anywhere, Substack's never going to be the place where have the biggest audience probably, but it certainly should be the place where your most valuable audience comes home to, where they get your best work. We're seeing a lot of really interesting success stories now of people that might have a big Instagram following or YouTube following and certainly Twitter following were able to use Substack now as this home base, this place to try to accumulate their most valuable audience that they own in the sense that they get their email address, they can export them at any time, and just build really simple tools to just help them deliver their best work.

Sachin Monga (00:38:47):
It could be writing, could be a podcast, could be video. We're investing a lot in some really interesting community features as well. You're a great example of this. To call Lenny's Newsletter simply a newsletter would be hilariously wrong at this point, right? I think you mentioned to me you had 30 meetups around the world last month or something like that.

Lenny (00:39:03):
That's right.

Sachin Monga (00:39:04):
It's an impressive of run rate of meetups. I think seeing that unfold and seeing how the platform can support that type of community behavior as well is a big thing that I'm excited about. Just more. On the reader's side, I think maybe to segue into that, I think we're again entering this little potential golden age of the internet for how you experience it as a consumer. Where instead of just having a handful of feeds that are basically the same, that you could just scroll through and consume videos of random people doing random things. Not to say that's bad and that should go away.

Sachin Monga (00:39:37):
I do my fair share of just scrolling through my phone and watching random videos too, but it'd be kind of nice to have another place you could go to as well where the best culture is being made and you have an extreme degree of control over what you see and who you choose to lead into that space. You might not spend two hours a day in there, and that's fine, but it might be the first place you go because it's where all the best stuff is and it's where your best communities are going to live too. We kind of see Substack evolving not as some new type of social media, but true alternative to how you might spend that most valuable slice of your time.

Sachin Monga (00:40:13):
We just launched an iPhone app, I guess now it's been six months ago, and it's going really well. We're going to launch an Android app very shortly. We're pushing really hard on this reader experience as well. I think it'll be radically different and much better one or two years from now too.

Lenny (00:40:28):
It's been interesting to see a growing percentage of the great content that I come across be on Substack, and so I think that's a cool trend for y'all. For writers that are thinking about starting a newsletter, thinking about joining Substack, what sorts of advice, tips, guidance do you have for folks that are thinking about getting into the Substack world?

Sachin Monga (00:40:50):
My first piece of advice would be to just start it and see what happens. Start it. Have a way to start gathering subscribers. Put a link to it somewhere. Write one or two things. If you're not much of a writer, try posting a video, recording some audio, turn into a little podcast. Just start basically and see what happens and see what kind of interest there might be out there for what you have to say, especially if you already have a following on other platforms as well.

Sachin Monga (00:41:17):
I think that there's a real risk that if your entire following is locked into one platform where you don't have a ton of control over, your ability to reach those people deterministically and certainly to monetize that in some way, it seems like it's a tenuous place to be in the current age of the internet. I'd say just start. It should be really easy. Go to Substack.com, press the start your Substack button, and see what happens.

Lenny (00:41:41):
That advice may sound to people like, "Oh yeah, that's not actual advice." But I will say that is exactly what I did and that's exactly how I got to what I do now. I had zero intention of ever doing this. Charging for writing that I'm writing, that's crazy. Just the fact that Substack existed and let me try stuff out for free. You sign up. You start it. My newsletter, it's called Lenny's Newsletter because that was like the default recommendation when I signed up, because I told them my name's Lenny and it's like Lenny's Newsletter, because I had no plan to do this. It was just like, let me just sign up and try blogging here for a little bit and that little path.

Lenny (00:42:21):
I think about Chris and Hamish and the founders mapping out a user journey of a vision of how somebody onboards to Substack, to go from never writing to doing it full-time. I feel like I went through that exactly, if they even had that, where I sign up just to try it out. I start writing consistently. It starts going well, then I think about charging, and then I launch the paid plan, and then that goes well. It keeps growing, and then I do it full-time. That's exactly what I went down and there's no world where I would've done this if not for those magical combination of features of just a really simple blog a d newsletter and collecting emails and maybe monetizing down the road.

Sachin Monga (00:43:01):
Yeah, that's amazing to hear.

Lenny (00:43:03):
I think that just start advice is really spot on. Just try it out, see if it's something you want to do. I will say, it's easy to start a newsletter, it's hard to continue a newsletter. The continuing is the most important part, as Seinfeld would say in that clip, who rings the bell.

Sachin Monga (00:43:17):
I will say though to that point too that I'm really excited for what Substack can do in the product to make that easier in a way that doesn't cheapen the experience. There's a bunch of things we could do to. We could automatically post stuff to your readers. We could do a lot of things. Going back to the how do we do discovery, there's a bunch of things that would probably just work, but they would eventually kill what Substack is or have all these nasty second order effects and ruin this promise of putting writers in charge, putting readers in charge.

Sachin Monga (00:43:45):
I'm really excited and I actually view your Substack as a vanguard, as a very leading edge example of this, of you have turned your Substack into not just this thriving community of readers, but also of contributors and creators. You've got these amazing people coming and doing guest posts. You've got the podcast going. You've got these meetups. You've I think in a lot of ways alleviated the burden of how hard it would be to just be writing a long form thing every day and doing that for the rest of your life. That would be really hard. That would make it certainly much harder to keep going.

Sachin Monga (00:44:19):
Not to say that it's easy now, I know how hard it is to do what you do. But I think Substack can do more to turn this ecosystem to funnel this energy into ways for people like you to feel more like a leader of a space and a curator in a lot of ways and still deliver this really valuable service to your audience without having to do all the work yourself. I think we can do a lot more to support that kind of thing.

Lenny (00:44:45):
Is there anything you could share about what sorts of things you're thinking there and what might be possible?

Sachin Monga (00:44:49):
Let's see. Guest posts are working really well, and I'll say that we have a bunch of ideas for how to make guest posts a much bigger thing. Right now, the way guest posts work, kind of like an op-ed or something, like you invite someone to come and just write a post on your Substack. I think there's much more we can do without getting into some of the specifics and scooping the product team that we're working on that I think could make it feel more like you've got a bunch of people who are somewhat more fluidly able to contribute to your Substack and deliver value to your audience.

Sachin Monga (00:45:18):
I've teased this community stuff that we're working on a little bit, but we're piloting a feature right now that's been working really well where writers can get a little bit of like a... We view it as the pub at the back of your Substack where people can hang out and chat and the writer is still in control and sets the tone and sets the rules and norms for the space, but can create space for their subscribers to participate and hang out themselves too. Those are two areas that we're investing in a fair bit right now.

Lenny (00:45:45):
Something that I imagine somebody suggested that I'd suggest you all look into a little bit is open AI assisted writing. I was playing with this product that is called Jasper and there's also Copy.ai. I put in the title of the post I was about to write and it just generated a pretty good paragraph summary of what it could have been. They have this whole feature where you just start typing and it autocompletes things smartly.

Sachin Monga (00:46:11):
That's crazy.

Lenny (00:46:11):
That would be cool. I don't know if you want to go there, but it's pretty good.

Sachin Monga (00:46:15):
That seems like an interesting can of worms.

Lenny (00:46:17):
Right, an interesting can of worms.

Sachin Monga (00:46:18):
We did talk about whether we should change our default publication. You know how your default name was just like Lenny's Newsletter and we probably gave you a little red square or something as your default publication logo originally. A DALL-E generated publication logo service would be pretty cool.

Lenny (00:46:33):
That would be cool. If nothing else, it's just for ideas, but I would love that. Coming back to the idea of someone starting a Substack, we talked about advice, which is the core advice is just start and see how you like it. A big part of this is like, do you want to keep doing this? Because again, it's easy to start, hard to keep going, and also you may realize, "I've created this job for myself I don't like." That's something they should be thoughtful about. But on the flip side, do you see any common mistakes people make when they're starting on Substack that you suggest they try to avoid?

Sachin Monga (00:47:02):
One thing that's interesting here that I think we have a big opportunity to improve in the product is that there's going to be obviously varying levels of intent that people have when they hit that start your Substack button. Some people might come in being like, "This is going to be my full-time job. I want to make this work. I want to not just be a full-time writer, I want to build a media empire on Substack." There's certainly examples of that happening now. You can imagine a version of our onboarding and set up flow that's like the media empire version of it.

Sachin Monga (00:47:28):
You could also imagine the version that's just, "Let me just write one thing. Don't make me make all these decisions. I just want to get in the game." I think that in general, a mistake that people might make is... I'll maybe flip it back to an anecdote related to what I heard from Chris when I was chatting with him the other day, that he had to convince you pretty hard to turn on payments at all. Correct me if I'm spreading misinformation, but is that right?

Lenny (00:47:51):
Yeah. And Hamish too. Especially on how often I can take a break, he's always given me advice of, "You can take a break more often than you think," because I feel like I can never not do a week. Both those pieces of advice. It took me a while to get over, maybe I could charge for this and then maybe I could take some weeks off.

Sachin Monga (00:48:10):
Right, right. I think there's a generalizable piece of advice here that might be my answer to the question of what's a common pitfall, which is people are really worried about how their audience will perceive them and really ultimately their own worth, right? Should I send a newsletter three times a week into people's inbox? Is that too much? Should I ask anyone to pay me ever? Is that crazy? Am I allowed to take a vacation ever given that I've got people paying on an ongoing basis? And is that a bad service to provide if I'm taking a two week summer vacation?

Sachin Monga (00:48:42):
I think almost in all of those cases, and then you could imagine five more things like that, readers, especially the people that are subscribed to you who are paying you, are pretty forgiving and are really there to support you and want you to take that vacation. There's probably more people who would want to pay for you that just don't even know about you that would totally pay if they could. Go back to that spectrum of, am I just trying to write a blog post? Am I trying to start a media empire? It's kind of like many people won't know yet. Just open up optionality for yourself and see what happens. Maybe don't be too worried about what your audience might think.

Sachin Monga (00:49:20):
I think that maybe is one difference between Substack than something like Twitter or Instagram or something. Subscribe as an action is pretty heavyweight. It's like a costly signal, right? It's not as easy as just matching the follow button on a bunch of accounts on Twitter or something like that. If someone is subscribed to you, they're granting you write access to their brain is maybe the way I view it in a nerdy sense. What that means is not just like, "I'll let you write your one long form thing once a week," but, "hey, you've got this other person that you think might have something interesting to say? Cool, let me know. I'm here for it." I think writers underestimate that.

Lenny (00:49:57):
Maybe three things I'll add to this just for folks that are thinking about, should I try this out? Should I not? One, when I joined Substack, I already felt like it was too late, and this was three years ago. I was like, "Nah, it's too late. Everyone's already got their big newsletters. There's no way I'm going to make any dent." I think people feel that now, and I think it's also not true. I think there's so much opportunity.

Sachin Monga (00:50:18):
100%.

Lenny (00:50:19):
Two, when I got to a thousand paid subscribers, which feels very doable, I was making around a 100K, which is exactly... I think it was Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans. It was exactly like, "Oh wow! I could make a living with a thousand true fans for real." It's shocking how much you could make with so few people that really care about what you're doing. Think about is there a niche or something you're excited about that you can find a thousand people to pay you 10 bucks a month.

Sachin Monga (00:50:52):
What's cool about that I think now with Substack and with the network effect is if there's a thousand people who are going to pay you 10 bucks a month, there's probably 2,000 and 5,000 and 10,000.

Lenny (00:50:58):
That's exactly what happened to me. I'm like, "If I hit a 100K, holy moly, I am good," and then it just kept growing. That's exactly right. You think there's an out, but the markets for these things are huge. The last point maybe is it took me nine months of doing it every week for free to get to a point where I felt like I can keep doing this. I enjoy doing this. People continue to value it, where I decided to turn on paid. It's a very slow and steady thing initially.

Lenny (00:51:24):
Don't expect it to just blow up. Just do it every week. See how it goes. See if you like it. See people like it. And if they do, keep going. If not, you can stop. When I launched my newsletter, I tweeted. I'm just going to experiment this thing. No idea where it's going to go. Just try it out, so you don't have to set the stakes high when you're starting out.

Sachin Monga (00:51:41):
I think that's exactly right. You mentioned Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans, which has become this canonical piece of writing on the internet now. My favorite Kevin Kelly blog post, that's my second favorite, my first favorite is a post that he wrote called You Are Not Late, which is exactly what you... You can probably picture what he says, but it's such a compelling, persuasive argument for the thing you mentioned, which is like... Obviously he wasn't talking about Substack in his post, but he was talking about the internet and how in the grand scheme of things, how lucky we are to...

Sachin Monga (00:52:13):
I don't even know when he wrote it, maybe it was probably 10 years ago at this point, but certainly at a time where a lot of people were feeling, "Oh, Facebook and Google and the internet's done. The battles have been won. I wish I was coming of age. I wish I had graduated from Harvard in 2004 or something." It's just so wrong. We are so early when it comes to how the internet will play out that I think getting to work on that in any capacity right now, getting to shape how the internet is going to play out over the next 10, 20 years is so fun because we are not late.

Lenny (00:52:40):
Here, here. I know Marc Andreessen mentioned those too when he moved to Silicon Valley in the '80s, "It's all over. It's too late. I missed the gold rush of tech," and it was just the beginning. Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you a bunch of questions real quick, share whatever comes up. Sound good?

Sachin Monga (00:52:59):
Sure, let's do it.

Lenny (00:53:00):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Sachin Monga (00:53:04):
I will plug some books that have nothing to do with the internet or software or tech, but have been the most informative or instructive books for me I think in my career as a product person working on software, which are books about architecture and urban planning. The reason why I find this field so fascinating is because for thousands of years, people have been figuring out how to build spaces that help people interact with each other and build good spaces to occupy. We've only been doing this for, going back to the Kevin Kelly thing, for basically the blink of an eye on the internet and in the digital realm.

Sachin Monga (00:53:35):
There's one book in particular by an architect named Christopher Alexander who sadly just passed away earlier this year. He wrote this book in the '70s. It's called The Timeless Way of Building. This is the book that I recommend to the most people I have. I buy it in bulk and I just give it away to people. The basic premise of the book is that in the '70s, we had just gone through a couple of decades of just mass produced cookie cutter suburban house development in the US. His premise was like we've basically just lost the plot on this. No one likes living in these houses.

Sachin Monga (00:54:06):
If you think about why these houses all feel bad to live in, it's because the people building the houses now for the first time ever are different than the people living in the house. It's these developers, these real estate developers, these big companies, mass producing these houses. But for thousands of years, we've figured out what makes a good house. The people building the house are the people living in it and they get that, but now the incentive structure got changed and they messed everything up.

Sachin Monga (00:54:27):
I think there's a really interesting parallel there with the internet, specifically how the last decade or so has played out, where the people building the spaces that we occupy are operating under a very complicated incentive structure and it's leading to these suboptimal user experiences. This is what we work on at Substack. This is what I think is fun to work on right now. If you're working on something like this, I would highly recommend The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander.

Lenny (00:54:51):
Awesome. We're going to include that in the show notes for sure. What are two or three Substacks that you recommend most speaking of recommendation features?

Sachin Monga (00:54:59):
I was just thinking about this as I don't write on stack certainly frequently, and so I don't use the recommendations feature, but who would I recommend if I did besides Lenny, of course? I'll share a couple of random examples maybe, again, outside of maybe the tech product world. There's this guy named Darryl Cooper who has a podcast on Substack called The Martyr Made Podcast that I've gone super deep into lately. It's hard to describe. He basically takes a topic and he will produce the single best explanation of that topic you will ever find, because you'll spend an insane amount, probably 10,000 hours per topic, figuring out getting to the bottom of this story.

Sachin Monga (00:55:38):
He's doing a series right now in the labor movement in America. It sounds like a boring topic maybe, but he's just such an amazing storyteller. He's I think a good example too of this could only really work if he finds his thousand true fans as people who are just like, "Yeah, I'll just pay for this." It would be a very bad advertising business for sure. He publishes pretty infrequently, inconsistently, but it's just the highest quality stuff. That's The Martyr Made Podcast. Since I know this is supposed to be a lightning round and I spent too much time on that, the two others that I'll just quickly throw out there, Colin Meloy is one of my favorite musicians.

Sachin Monga (00:56:10):
He's the lead singer of The Decemberists. He's doing a really cool thing on his Substack right now of just a lot of interesting behind the scenes stuff on tour, publishing, audio and video. It's been really good. If you're a fan of The Decemberists, I highly recommend. One more, let's see, I have been really excited about Ethan Strauss lately. He writes a Substack called the House of Strauss. He's a basketball writer, but I think it's a cool example of like he just has subscribers now. He can write whatever he wants. He writes about a wide range of topics and they're all just really fascinating. I love to see that kind of thing happen on Substack and in general.

Lenny (00:56:41):
That's just reminding me, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just recommended my newsletter in his Substack.

Sachin Monga (00:56:45):
Oh man, congrats! That must be a life achievement right there.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Yeah. I'm like, what the hell?

Sachin Monga (00:56:52):
Congrats!

Lenny (00:56:53):
Thank you.

Sachin Monga (00:56:54):
He's a great writer. .

Lenny (00:56:54):
I don't know if he reads it. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I love it. He has got a great Substack, by the way. I think if you just Google Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Substack, you'll find it. On the recommendation feature, I was just thinking, do you want to shout out the folks that built it, the team?

Sachin Monga (00:57:07):
I would love to.

Lenny (00:57:08):
Let's do it.

Sachin Monga (00:57:09):
It's too many. It ended up being a company wide effort, but the product manager on my team, Dayne Rathbone, was specifically I think the spearhead behind the way that we built it, like you mentioned, that we went into. He was a really big proponent for that. Gabriel on our design team designed it and many engineers worked on it. It'll be hard to shout them all out, but I'd shout out Dayne on my team because he ensured that we built it in the way that we ultimately needed to build it for it to work.

Lenny (00:57:36):
Thank you, Dayne and Gabriel. Two final questions. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you watched that you love?

Sachin Monga (00:57:44):
Yeah. I just finished the latest season of For All Mankind and loved it.

Lenny (00:57:49):
So good.

Sachin Monga (00:57:50):
Did you watch it all?

Lenny (00:57:52):
Yes. Oh my God! The last couple episodes, you're sitting on the edge of your seat.

Sachin Monga (00:57:55):
I feel like in this season, every episode was like its own standalone movie or something. It started slow the whole show. I think the first season was a bit slow. When I recommend it to people, I'm like, "Just power through it," but they really found their groove. I don't know. I'm stoked for the next season.

Lenny (00:58:10):
Same. Final question, what's a favorite interview question you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?

Sachin Monga (00:58:16):
I have a tough time answering this question because I have found that there's not one question that will get me the signal I actually want given how diverse the candidate's experiences might be in their context. If you're coming from a Facebook type place or coming from a startup, I might need to ask different questions in order to get the signal I want. Maybe I'll answer it in that way, which is like these days, especially for Substack, what is the signal that I'm trying to get?

Sachin Monga (00:58:43):
I think really for early stage, fast growing startup, we talked so much about how different that is, we just need people who can run through walls to accomplish big goals. Maybe grit and endurance in some ways and drive are the words I would throw out there. I find it's really hard to have one question that will get that signal. We need to tailor it to that person's background.

Lenny (00:59:07):
All right, I'll accept that meta answer. Sachin, thank you so much for being here. As you I've shared, Substack is very near and dear to my heart, and I'm really thankful that you spent the time to dig into a lot of these things that have been on my mind. I imagine it will be helpful to a lot of other people. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? Are y'all hiring? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Sachin Monga (00:59:31):
First of all, thank you, Lenny, for being such an amazing Substack example setter. We talk about you all the time, as you can imagine internally, and you've been so helpful to the company and to our product team. It's been a real honor to get to come onto the pod and keep doing what you're doing. You can find me on all the various social media platforms. I'm not super active on them, I must admit, but maybe Twitter would be the one where I spend the most time, which is just Sachin Monga, my first name and last name, is my handle.

Sachin Monga (00:59:58):
I'll make one plug for a role that we're hiring for right at Substack, which is a senior data role with a product and growth analytics bent would be the specific archetype we're looking for in this role. If you are listening to the pod and feel like that might be you, I would love to chat. I think my email address too, I don't know if it would get shared, but it's just Sachin, my first name, @substackinc.com. Feel free to send me a note anytime.

Lenny (01:00:24):
Awesome. We'll include that in the show notes. Sounds like y'all are building some cool analytics features maybe based on that role. I'm excited for that. Awesome, man. Thank you for being here.

Sachin Monga (01:00:33):
My pleasure. Thank you so much for having me.

# How to hit revenue targets in a recession | Sahil Mansuri (Bravado)

## Transcript

Sahil Mansuri (00:00:00):
It's hard to plan what you should do for all of 2023. I think the advice that most founders are getting from their boards is when you have limited visibility, you have to plan in the most conservative way. On the one hand, of course that's true, you have to be conservative. But on the other hand, you don't want to be unreasonably conservative because you don't want to be floundering from like, oh, we're screwed to everything's better, to we're screwed, everything's better. 

(00:00:29):
So the way I think about setting up a plan when you have limited visibility and some major headwinds is setting up a really conservative plan and then having milestones, short term milestones that unlock the ability to lean into growth and spend based on hitting those targets.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my aim here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Sahil Mansuri. Sahil is the CEO and founder of Bravado, which has built the world's largest online sales community of over 300,000 salespeople, and they're now building SaaS products for salespeople. Sahil has one of the most unique perspectives on the art and skill of sales, partly because of the community and the company that he runs, and partly because he was a longtime salesperson himself. 

(00:01:21):
As you'll hear in this episode, he has closed some incredible deals, including a wild story about cold emailing Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook and what that led to. In this episode, we focus on what founders should change and how they do sales during this market downturn, including how you should approach sales quotas, how you should rethink the way you do comp plans for salespeople, how you do forecasting, also why you should refocus on retention and your existing customers, how to improve your sales technique in general no matter what role you're in. 

(00:01:52):
As someone without a lot of depth in sales, I always find it fascinating to learn how to get better at sales. This episode has something for everyone. With that, I bring you Sahil Mansuri. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:02:13):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:02:15):
How many of them screw that up? What happens when they do?

Ashley (00:02:18):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:38):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing longterm retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:52):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile, this because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Sahil Mansuri (00:04:21):
Thanks Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:23):
So we're going to be talking about sales and in particular what you should be adjusting in your company during these very turbulent market conditions. But I thought first it'd be helpful if you just gave a little background on yourself to kind of give folks a sense of why you have such unique insights into the sales world. So maybe just talk about a little bit of your background and then what you do now, the company that you run now. 

Sahil Mansuri (00:04:46):
I've spent my whole career in sales. I started out in sales when I was in college. I worked on the Obama campaign. We didn't call it sales, right? We called it turning out the votes or street teamwork or field ops or phone banking, but it was sales. We were just selling the dream, literally the American dream as it were. So I've been in some sort of a role where my primary responsibility was to cold call, send emails, have conversations, objection handle, and try to get someone to sign a contract for my entire career.

(00:05:22):
I started selling in September of 2008 was my first month with a quota. So I started selling in the middle of the last financial crisis. In 2009, the company that I used to do sales for, which is called Meltwater, this company, it's a pretty crazy story. It's one of the few companies that has made it to $100 million in recurring revenue without a drop of venture funding. It's a Norwegian company actually. 

(00:05:52):
If I remember correctly, don't quote me on the exact numbers here, but the company had basically gone 10 million to 30 million to 50 million to 70 million, and then in 2009, they went from 70 million to 69 million. It was the first year that they hadn't not only increased revenue, but revenue had gone down. In that year, in 2009, I broke the company record for the most sales by any individual person in one year in the history of the company. I say that not out of hubris or out of pride, I say that because I've literally sold in a downturn. In the middle of a recession, I have been an account executive selling, carrying a quota and have been successful in doing it.

(00:06:37):
Then went on to be a sales leader at a bunch of different places, probably most notably at Glassdoor, where I joined as one of the first 20, 25 employees. Was responsible for enterprise sales there. Personally closed Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Ford, Visa, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Walmart. At its peak, at one point I think Glassdoor had about 100 of the Fortune 500 customers and I'd sold about 60 of them myself. I've done a lot of selling in my career, also a decent amount of sales management and sales leadership. 

(00:07:14):
But really my forte is selling. I love to sell. I love to talk to customers. I love to train salespeople. I've been a VP of sales and CRO in a couple different places. Then for the last five years I've been building a community for salespeople that's called Bravado. Bravado is a network of about 300,000 B2B tech sales. That's about 50,000 VPs of sales and CROs, about 150,000 account executives, another like 40 to 50,000 SDRs. Then the rest of it are kind of customer success, sales engineers, sales ops, sales enablement, et cetera. 

(00:07:59):
So it's a network that purely focuses on sales, and much akin to your business, I suppose, marries community learning, upskilling, recruiting as this one place that a salesperson can go in order to beat the odds, be successful in their career, find a great job, or hit and crush quota in their role.

Lenny (00:08:22):
Awesome. I think that gives a clear picture of why you have such unique insights. I don't know if there's anyone that has such a broad access to so many salespeople and what they're doing, what they're thinking about. The core part of the Bravado product, just to make it even clear, is a community or people ask questions, help each other through sales issues, things like that, right?

Sahil Mansuri (00:08:41):
Yeah. So if you're familiar with Stack Overflow and what that network and community means to engineering, Bravado has a product that's affectionately known as the War Room, which does the same thing. So you have 50,000 companies, sales teams that are on Bravado. We get a realtime pulse of which companies are hitting quota, which ones are missing quota, which sales reps are closing deals with which organizations, which industries are doing better or worse. 

(00:09:12):
So we do get a really interesting perspective within the world of B2B tech sales, to be clear, a really interesting perspective on what's happening in terms of companies and revenue and forecast and quota, which gives us hopefully an opportunity to serve those members and the general tech community at large in terms of how they can beat the odds, especially as we're back to that 2008 crunch that we saw then as well.

Lenny (00:09:39):
Awesome. Just to put this out there, I'm a very small investor in Bravado. I'm just a fan of these kinds of companies, community led SaaS tooling. I was really impressed with the way you're building and the way you're approaching it. Also, I don't have a lot of depth in sales, and so I loved this opportunity to learn about how sales works by participating. So thank you for letting me join the journey of Bravado. It's a really unique company and I'm excited to see where it all goes. 

(00:10:05):
So with this podcast, we were planning to talk about sales. Initially, it was going to be how to get better at sales, how to be a better salesperson. But you had this great suggestion that we instead focus more specifically on what founders should change in the coming year knowing the conditions of the market and how things are turbulent and how people are spending less and things like that. So we're going to talk about five things that you can do right now to change the way your sales process works starting now for the next year. The idea is once you listen to this conversation, you can go and do these things immediately with your team. So that sound good?

Sahil Mansuri (00:10:41):
Yeah, it sounds great. I mean, I think, inherent in this conversation will be things that you can do to be better at sales, but I think the way in which you sell has to be different based on market condition. So if we had done this podcast eight months ago or 18 months ago or 28 months ago or 38 months ago, I think we would've had one set of conversation. We would've talked about growing top line revenue. We would've talked about how to get your first 20 customers. We would've talked about how to build and scale a sales team. We would've talked about setting quotas and whatnot. 

(00:11:18):
I think that today, the market has shifted because we know that the cost of capital has gone up. We know that funding has dried up. We know that investors today are only interested in companies that have strong unit economics and have high retention rates. Cold prospecting goes down in favor of cross-selling and upselling your existing customer base because it's hard to break into new accounts when companies have budget freezes and hiring freezes and layoffs, and everyone is watching really closely the capital outflow of their business. So your sale strategy has to fundamentally change in order to meet the moment and meet the market to where it is.

Lenny (00:12:00):
Great context setting. You touched on a few of the things we're going to talk about, so I'm excited to get into it. The first topic I wanted to chat about is forecasting and quotas. You have some advice on how founders should be thinking about adjusting their forecast plans and their quotas for next year. Can you talk about that? 

Sahil Mansuri (00:12:18):
Yeah, so let's start with some data and then we'll talk about why this matters. So on Bravado, as I mentioned, we have 300,000 members, but only about 200,000 of them. So about 65% of the network uses a product called the Seller Portfolio. The Seller Portfolio is a realtime tracker of how you and your sales team are performing relative to quota. You can kind of think of it like mint.com, but instead of being for personal finance, it's for sales. Based on that, we're able to get a realtime perspective on which companies in specific, and then overall which industries and in which sectors are at or above or below quota. 

(00:12:57):
So I'll share some stats with you. So in Q3 of this year, so I guess as of last month, in Q3 of this year, 63% of sales reps missed quota, 63%. That's up from 54% in Q2 and 46% in Q1. So you've basically got 30% more of the sales team missing quota today than you did literally just six months ago. If you broaden that out to a team wide structure, 76% of companies missed their Q3 target. 76% of companies missed their Q3 target. That's up from 59% in Q2 and 51% in Q1. So you actually have 33% more companies that are missing target. 

(00:13:46):
Then at this point, it's gone from being like the occasional company is struggling to pretty much every tech company is struggling. We would predict, based on the data that we're seeing, that over 80% of companies will miss their Q4 goals. So in a world in which the vast majority of sales reps are missing quota and the even larger vast majority of companies are missing quota and their forecast, that on the one hand explains why you're seeing this bunch of layoffs.

(00:14:15):
On the other hand though, it raises the question of what do I do for next year? On the one hand, you don't want to bring down targets too significantly because it's going to raise a lot of red flags in terms of spend and burn and probably meet a lot of really painful decision. On the other hand, it's really hard to have visibility into what the market's going to look like six months, I mean, heck, even like six weeks from now. Things are changing on a realtime basis. 

(00:14:44):
Something interesting that we saw is that we have quarterly tracking, but we also have monthly tracking. So something interesting we saw is that from November until March of last year, companies were basically blowing out their quota, sales reps were blowing out their quota. All of a sudden everything came to a screeching halt in April, and April, May and June were really tough times. You saw that outwardly in the market in terms of layoffs and hiring freezes and such. But we saw it on a realtime basis in terms of percentage to quota and companies missing their target.

(00:15:15):
What was interesting is that a bunch of companies then revised down their forecast for the rest of the year, but then companies started beating those forecasts in July, August, September. So for a moment there, it actually looked like we might be out of the worst of it, and then came obviously a much maligned double dip recession, which then in October, November, all of a sudden everyone just started missing. Many of your listeners, I would imagine, work at VC backed SaaS companies, so they can, in the comments or whatnot, speak about whether this is also true for them. 

(00:15:48):
But I would imagine that for most of companies going into the middle to end of September, they probably felt pretty good. They actually thought like, "Oh, maybe we can actually squeak by in Q3. Maybe we can revise up forecast in Q4. Maybe we can hire into next year and we can go back to growing the way we were for the previous 10 years." Then October was just a bloodbath. On companies that do monthly quotas, 85% of sales reps missed quota in October for their monthly number. I think it's going to be even higher in November based on what we're seeing. 

(00:16:26):
So again, I share all this information with you to just kind of set the stage on what's happening realtime in the market. So given that September felt good, but today we're totally screwed, it's hard to plan what you should do for all of 2023. I think the advice that most founders are getting from their boards is when you have limited visibility, you have to plan in the most conservative way. On the one hand, of course that's true. You have to be conservative. But on the other hand, you don't want to be unreasonably conservative because you don't want to be floundering from like, oh, we're screwed to everything's better, to we're screwed, everything's better. 

(00:17:06):
So the way I think about setting up a plan when you have limited visibility and some major headwinds is setting up a really conservative plan and then having milestones, short term  milestones that unlock the ability to lean into growth and spend based on hitting those targets. So here's an example. Let's say that you did $10 million in revenue this year and next year you have no idea what that's going to look like. Maybe you say, "Okay, let's plan like we're going to be down to 9 million. We're going to lose 10% of revenue next year despite our best efforts because the market's going to be really tough."

(00:17:45):
So that would mean that in Q1 you need to hit 2.5 million in revenue. Let's say in Q1, if we hit 2.5, then we should revise up our targets for the rest of the year and we can unlock this additional budget to kind of spend off of. If we hit below 2, we should revise down our number. So kind of being comfortable with regularly reforecasting. Forecasting, you can't just forecast a quarter out every time. Obviously that's a tough way to run a business. So you got to forecast a year, but then set milestones, checkpoints and kind of make predetermined decisions that allow you to avoid the bias of then walking into Q1 and being like, "Oh, we missed in Q1, but no, no, we're really going to hit it in Q2."

(00:18:29):
You got to set the targets upfront because as founders, we tend to have a bias towards optimism. That's generally how founders operate. In today's market, that's more of a disadvantage than an advantage. So my suggestion is to really think about forecasting conservatively, setting up checkpoints and milestones around what future success may or may not look like. If you hit those goals, then decelerating or accelerating into it depending upon what you get there, and coming to an agreement with your board, with your sales team, with your sales leadership in advance so that there's no debate about what to do when you actually get there.

Lenny (00:19:06):
That is awesome advice. As a PM, it makes me think a little bit about moving to an agile sprint sort of system versus this long term waterfall oriented planning process. Have you seen this need happen in the past? Is this the first time we need to plan to reforecast throughout the year? Or have you been through periods where this is just the way people operate when times are super uncertain?

Sahil Mansuri (00:19:28):
First of all, I think the vast majority of CEOs and sales leaders haven't been through a period of dramatic uncertainty in their careers. I mean, there are obviously people who have been in business for more than 15 years and who have been through other downturns. But unless you were a sales leader, a CEO, an executive in 2008, which I would imagine that not very many people were or certainly not everyone was, then you haven't seen anything like this. People try to analogize it to COVID, but I think that that's actually not a good analog for this. 

(00:19:59):
The reason why is because COVID was an external factor versus this is actually an internal issue, which is to say that there are actually industries that are doing much better these days except for tech. Tech is getting crushed, right? In COVID, everyone's getting crushed. So it didn't matter if you owned a yoga studio or gas pump or whatever, a hotel. There was nothing that was working well unless I guess you owned Amazon Fresh or something. There were very few businesses that were doing better as a result of COVID. But there's a bunch of companies that aren't doing that bad. I mean, if you listen to other podcasts, you've probably seen that tech is the one that is getting the most hammered in this, although I think in the last two weeks, crypto has caught up pretty quickly.

(00:20:47):
But it's really kind of tech, right? So when you see a slowdown in tech that is disproportionate, you have to assume that it may last for a much longer period of time than you imagine. I think that given the lack of visibility and the amount of volatility, I think it is a unique situation for most companies, for most leaders. I think that the only response to which is to try to get really comfortable with being wrong and adding new data in in order to make decisions regularly without the fear of coming across as not knowing what you're doing.

Lenny (00:21:27):
Things seem to have been crazy for a long time. It's interesting that this is the first year where you're finding that companies have to do this. Before we get to the next topic, I wanted to come back to the stats that you had real quick. Can you talk again about how you get those stats? Is this like a salesperson plugs into their system somehow in exchange for getting access to the benchmarking? How does that work because that's very cool?

Sahil Mansuri (00:21:49):
Yeah, exactly. That's right. It's a gift to get model. So the way it works is that you enter your stats, and in doing so, you get global benchmarks of how you're doing versus other reps or other companies. So there's a premium for being accurate here because otherwise you don't actually get a real sense of how you're doing versus others. So there's an incentive structure that's built in to be really precise. Then that information feeds into our kind of global leaderboard where we are able to slice and dice and say, "Okay, of companies that are headquartered in San Francisco, here's how your company's doing. Of sales reps that sell to CMOs, here's how you're doing. Of reps who carried a quota of between 500, 700K this quarter, here's how you rank." So we do global benchmarking for sales reps and sales teams and we share that information for free to anyone who is willing to participate in the ecosystem.

Lenny (00:22:43):
That is very cool. I had no idea that was something you did. How do folks join that if they want to join up?

Sahil Mansuri (00:22:49):
Simple, everything's available for free. Just come to bravado.co and we have something called a Seller Portfolio. Go ahead and build one of those and then enter the information and then you'll start to receive the stats as they come out each quarter.

Lenny (00:23:00):
Sweet. Okay, second topic, comp plans. You have some advice for how teams should think about comp plans for their sales people? What's your advice?

Sahil Mansuri (00:23:09):
So comp plans are, or compensation plans for sales, are very different than they are for most other profession. So in most professions, yours and product management, you have a base salary that encompasses the vast majority of your cash compensation. You then often have bonuses that are either based on company or sometimes personal milestone, which are often paid out end of quarter, end of year. Then you'll have an equity grant that you vest over the course of time. That's not how it works in sales. 

(00:23:39):
So the way it works in sales is that you have what's known as a base and then what's known as an OET. An OTE or on target earnings is how much you make if you hit quota. The most common ratio that you see in SaaS is what's known as a 50-50 split. So let's just use some round numbers. Let's say that your OTE is $200,000. What that means is that your base salary is actually only $100,000. So unlike in most other professions, sales reps make very little base salary, but their OTEs are often higher than in most other professions because they're variable, so the second $100,000 you unlock through your performance on the sales team. 

(00:24:25):
Again, I'm going to use the most common examples for this, and every combines different, et cetera, but what's really common is if you have a 200K OTE, 100K base, 100K commission, then your quota will be $1 million. So the ratio between your OTE and your quota is typically five to one. So your quota is usually 5X. This comes from this idea that your cost for a sales rep fully loaded should be about 20% so you can afford to pay 20% of your salary to a sales rep. So let's talk about what that all means. 

(00:24:59):
So what that means is that you as a salesperson have to sell $1 million of software in order to make $200,000 of money. But that $1 million of software is only around new business. The vast majority of account executives are only responsible for new business, which means top line revenue growth. So let's pick two theoretical examples. Okay, let's say they're sales rep A and sales rep B, and they both have the same quota, same OTE, okay? We're selling for the same product, same sales team. Sales rep A closes $1.5 million in 2022. Just for easy math, let's say that's 15 100K deals. So product is 100K. They sold us 15 deals a year. They would close $1.5 million. 

(00:25:46):
That means that they would hit 150% of quota. When that happens, when you exceed your quota, you hit in sales what are known as accelerators. So it's not like if you hit 1 million, you make 200, but if you hit 1.2 million, you just make an extra on that 200K. You actually often make extra money for exceeding your quota. The more you exceed your quota, the more money you make. So you would imagine that if someone sold 1.5 million, they wouldn't make 300K, which would be 20% cost to sale. They might make 400K. That's pretty common in sales. 

(00:26:21):
So this person who closed $1.5 million in business from 15 deals ends up making $400,000 and they get taken on a free trip to Cabo because they made President's Club and they're put on the leader board and the CEO of the company gives them an award at the end of the year and they are heralded as the pinnacle of all things that are sales. The VP of sales says, "Wow, I can't wait to clone 10 of you." That's how sales teams are set up, right? 

(00:26:47):
Then you have sales rep B. Sales rep B only closes 12 deals for 1.2 million. So they still exceed quota, but they only exceed quota by 20%, not 50%. That sales rep ends up making let's say 250K. So they make $150,000 less money. They don't get to go on the trip to Cabo. They don't get the award at the end of the year. They're not the ones that are celebrated or championed and they're seen as a good performer but not as good as team player A. That all makes a lot of sense in a world in which companies are really focused on top line growth.

(00:27:25):
Nothing is more important than the amount of ARR you're making and how fast you're growing and investors are basically demanding that you go 3, 2, 2, 2, which is common parlance for if you make 5 million this year, you should make 15 million next year, you should make 45 million the year after, and then you can slow down to going 90 then 180. This is how VCs often think about funding SaaS companies. They look for this 3, 3, 2, 2 sort of multiple growth on ARR, new business ARR. That's how the world used to function until six months ago. 

(00:27:58):
Then six months ago, all of a sudden the music stopped and capital got expensive and everybody started being like, "Whoa, wait a minute. We should think about things like net dollar retention and we should think about what renewal rates look like and we should think about how efficient you are at acquiring customers." All of a sudden, profitability, efficiency, retention came into focus as everybody realized that unprofitable growth was no longer going to be rewarded because you couldn't just keep spending in order to acquire customers. Acquiring new customers was going to get harder so retaining the ones you had and making sure they were happy was actually far more important.

(00:28:35):
So let's go back to our example. So team player player A who closed 15 deals for 1.5 million, poster child for the company, got $400,000. Let's say out of their 15 customers, 10 of them churn next year and only five of them actually end up renewing. How much does that affect player A's compensation, their performance, their celebration, et cetera? Doesn't affect them at all. Make no difference. 99% of SaaS companies are set up this way, right? Every SaaS company of, with very small exceptions, HubSpot, monday.com, there's a handful of them, except for very few SaaS companies, no difference to the salesperson's performance. It's seen as a failure of customer success. Other people get blamed for it. Sales rep, no change in their comp work or their success.

(00:29:32):
Meanwhile, sales rep B who closed fewer deals, 12 of them. Let's say all 12 renew, and not only do all 12 renew, but let's say that three of them actually are so happy with the product and service that they're willing to be featured on your website as the folks that you advertise. Let's say six of them are actually willing to be references. So they help you close even more business by getting on the phone with prospective customers and are willing to actually advocate for your product. Let's say that not only do they renew, but four of them actually upsell because they're so happy they end up spending more and they sign multi-year contracts and whatnot. 

(00:30:09):
How much did that affect sales rep B's performance? Do we go back and revise and say, "Well, wait a minute. Actually sales rep B's customers were way better and actually we should probably have rewarded sales rep B because they actually had done the homework of finding the right clients instead of just shoving product down people's throats." No, none of that happens. Again, that kind of made sense up until six months ago, but it makes no sense today. So sales comp plans are stuck in the stone ages. They're stuck in the world of Glengarry Glen Ross, Boiler Room, Wolf of Wall Street, get the dollar in through the door, Matthew McConaughey [inaudible 00:30:45]. That's where sales comp plans are. 

(00:30:49):
What we haven't done is built a modern technical sales compensation plan that actually aligns the needs and incentives of the business, the customer and the rep. So I think that for a while there, I mean, I've been writing and talking about this for years, for a while there it fell on a lot of deaf ears because no one cared. People care now because all of a sudden for the first time, all of the things that we're talking about around retention and renewal rates and stuff are coming up. So I would say that my general advice to companies is to say what are the metrics that matter and ensuring that those metrics are the ones that your sales team is rewarded for. 

(00:31:31):
I also call into question the notion that your sales team should have a 50-50 split on compensation. By the way, that doesn't just extend to the sales team. That's often how the VP of sales is compensated. So your executive, your chief revenue officer, your VP of sales who sits at the same table as your CMO and your CFO and your COO, that person also has a 50-50 split in most cases. Sometimes it's 60-40, but it's very rarely 90-10, which is what it is for almost every other executive on your team.

(00:32:00):
So salespeople get labeled as coin operated and mercenaries and all these other adages because the way we compensate them, the way we treat them, the way we measure them is in a mercenary sort of way. Again, I would call on founders and VCs and executives to rethink that and to instead come up with compensation that aligns the incentives, again, of the customer, the business and the rep and the leader. So I think that setting up a longer horizon where if the customer you sign up today ends up renewing tomorrow, the rep should get a kicker on it. 

(00:32:40):
We should look at what the overall renewal rate is of the sales rep comparing it of course to the renewal of the rest of the business. If one rep is doing a better job of qualifying the right customers upfront, they should be rewarded for that. So things like that I think are missing from sales compensation and I'm excited to see them come to the front this year.

Lenny (00:33:00):
As an outsider, this all sounds very obvious like this is how it should work. I imagine a reason it doesn't is it adds complexity and then there's this feedback loop that's a lot longer because you have to wait to see if they renew. So two questions that I guess. One is you're saying that it works companies are doing it this way. You mentioned a few, HubSpot, monday.com. Are there others that folks can look at to model how they could approach it this way? Then is there any other reason that folks haven't rethought the way comp plans work? Is it just like, "Nah, it's working, we don't have to break it"?

Sahil Mansuri (00:33:36):
I'll answer the second question first because the answer to the first question is really simple. I think that there is a lack of transparency around how a lot of sales compensation plans work and companies tend to make it up as they go along. Oftentimes companies change their comp plans like each month, each quarter based on whatever is the business unit or the goal of the business. So I've seen things like, oh, company release product B after only selling product A. So we'll double the commission on product B because we want to get it in people's hands. Or we really want to target CPG customers so CPG customers are worth extra commission. 

(00:34:12):
So companies tend to weigh down comp plans with basically a bunch of bullshit that doesn't have anything to do with how the compensation plan should be structured, but just has to do with the whims of the executives and the board that month or that quarter. So I don't know of any organizations I think do this excellently. I just know a lot of companies that do it better than most. I think it depends on your company or business and your incentive. But I would say that in today's economy, taking a longer term view to a sales compensation, instead the short term, like you're a hunter, your job is just to close deals and doesn't really matter, a dollar is a dollar no matter where it comes from is not true anymore. 

(00:34:55):
So I guess that's the answer to that. Coming back to the other question though, which is why are sales comp plans not innovated off of because this seems obvious? First of all, it's obvious because of how I explained it. I'm not taking credit for it. It's just that I'm giving you a lot of context that you would not get otherwise, right? The context you would get otherwise if you just walked in and you got your traditional old school VC and CEO doesn't really know what they're doing and just listening to their board is like, here's how sales comp plans work, right?

(00:35:25):
You want to grow revenue, you want to get customers, you got to pay top dollar and you got to fire them up and set aggressive quotas and you got to push them and you want to put these big spiffs out there because that's how salespeople work. A founder doesn't know. This is the problem is that people don't know because nobody really understands sales and salespeople. They just kind of are like, "Well, I can't sell and I don't really want to do that. So I'm just going to hire this 50 year old white guy who's done this at a bunch of different companies and then have him bring in because it's always a 50 year old, it's always a white person and it's always a guy, right?"

(00:36:01):
Sales is one of the least diverse professions when it comes to leadership and it's one of the things that we really champion here at Bravado is this idea that 92% of sales leaders or VPs of sales are white. Over 85% of sales leaders are white. So is that representative of the total population of who should be a sales leader? No, of course not. It's just representative of the fact that like, oh, you don't want to innovate here. Just hire someone who's been there, done that before. 

(00:36:31):
So you get a lot of sludge in the system. You get a lot of people doing the same shit over and over again even though it doesn't work, which is kind of the opposite of that Einstein quote, right? So founders don't know how to set comp plans. They are just listening to what other people tell them should be the way they do it. There's a way it's done and it's really hard to break that. It's kind of like when you talked about waterfall versus agile. Once you do agile you're like, "Wait, why would we have ever done it the other way?" Well, it's because everyone was always doing it that way, et cetera, et cetera. No one ever got fired for buying IBM, et cetera. You get where I'm going. 

(00:37:06):
But the other thing Lenny that I think is problematic is everyone loves to optimize in the short run when it comes to revenue in sales. That's really I think the other big driver. If I offered you a plan that said, hey, you can grow by 20% revenue quarter over quarter or we can spike revenue by 75% this quarter though I don't know what that's going to do to the business in the future. Which of these do you want? Tell me how many founders really are willing to take option A? What do you think? 

(00:37:37):
Let's say I just told you those were your options. I can figure out a way to increase revenue by 75% this quarter though I can give you no promise as to what that means for the future. Or I can make you a plan where we increase revenue 20% quarter over quarter for the next six quarters. Which of those two plans would you sign up for? What do you think is a percentage of startup founder six months ago, eight months ago, 10 months ago to indefinitely that would've signed up for plans?

Lenny (00:38:01):
Yeah, it's interesting. Hearing you describe the way it should be structured and then hearing you pitch this. I would definitely pick goal one. Let's grow. Let's get this. It'll work out, it'll work its way out. We'll figure it out later. Let's just keep new customers coming in. So I don't know. I guess like 99% probably choose that first one.

Sahil Mansuri (00:38:25):
Yeah, I think that's right. Well, I mean that is right because that's what everyone signed up for. But then all of a sudden, and again, that was okay because even if all your customers churned, it didn't matter because you could just go raise more money based on the growth and then just keep pouring more money on it, more money on it. No one gave a shit about the leaky bucket, right? Because you could just keep adding more water at the top. Now all of a sudden the faucet's off. 

(00:38:42):
So given this seismic change in the market, how is it that we can reverse the short term thinking and start to actually build good businesses? Because I think that's the real problem, right? The real problem isn't sales compensation plans and quotas. That's a symptom. A real problem is we all just wanted to have hyper growth instead of thinking are we actually building good businesses. I wouldn't say that we at Bravado were immune from this by the way. It's not like I'm sitting here on my golden throne pontificating to the masses. 

(00:39:23):
We made a bunch of decisions over the course of growing this business that were incentivized for the short term. Every single time we did that, it ended up being really expensive. Now, sometimes we caught that before money ran out and before we saw the problem. Sometimes we didn't and then we were like, "Oh, shit. It's a fire drill." But at the end of the day, there is no replacement for building a product that customers love and having a great go to market motion that brings that product and that value to your clients and ensuring that they actually are thrilled that they bought your product and are getting a lot of value from it.

(00:40:00):
Yeah, it sounds so simple, but the amount of companies that actually don't really care if their customers get value from their product versus just measuring top line revenue growth numbers and logos and whatever is I think more meaningful than people are willing to admit.

Lenny (00:40:16):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without is damn hard. But it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually use Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. 

(00:40:51):
You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with a pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. With one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks. Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. 

(00:41:28):
That's a great segue to the third topic, which is around retaining your existing customers and putting more focus on that versus top line, or yeah, new growth. Do you have some thoughts on just how to do that and why that's so important?

Sahil Mansuri (00:41:42):
Let's start here, which is cold call, cold email response rates have never been lower. Never been lower. I think you're seeing this across every sales team. Again, if you're listening to this and you have a sales team, you know what I'm saying is true. Top of funnel pipeline is drying fast faster than our planet's drying up in fact. Enterprise sales cycles are just getting longer and longer. We are lucky to have a couple of investors who have really, really broad exposure to the tech market. Everything from really large public IPOs all down to small startups. 

(00:42:21):
In conversations with them, they've been really clear that they're seeing this incredible, the average enterprise sales cycle is 62 days, it's now like 115 days or something. So customers are dragging their feet, everything's going to no decision, no decision typically means I'm not going to say yes now because I don't want to spend the money. I actually like the thing but I'm not going to buy it. Which means the same thing for you as a business, which is that you're not making any money. 

(00:42:45):
So in a world in which you can't sell to new customers, your only hope is to keep the ones you got for long enough to survive and then hopefully even maybe be able to upsell and cross-sell those customers into new products, as well as potentially leverage those customers to get warm intros into a potential new business. Psychologically, when times are tough people hoard, people keep their things close and people trust the safety of those they know versus those they don't. This is basic human psychology, right? 

(00:43:18):
So given that that's the case, if you're a company that doesn't have a lot of customers and you're trying to go out to market and sell your product, you're in a lot of trouble. If you are a company that has a large customer base and you've done a shitty job of engaging, retaining, maintaining relationships with them and prioritized top of line growth, this is your alert. This section is for you. Because what you should be doing, I will tell you the most dramatic thing you could do and then we can kind of work backwards. Take your best sales people and make them CSMs. There's no point. There's no point in having your best salespeople sell.

(00:43:59):
Well, what's the point if people aren't going to buy anyway? If they do, they're going to buy in onesie, twosies, not these big enterprise deals. No one's going to sign these big accounts right now. Who in tech today is like, "Wow, I can't wait to sign a multi-year contract with a new vendor we've never tried." Right? Nobody's doing that. If people are signing things, they're signing for three month pilots or kind of like all sort... I mean, the deal sizes are coming down, et cetera. I mean, this is all very common. Make your best sales people CSMs and be like, "Your job is to make sure that all these great customers we have never, ever, ever leave."

Lenny (00:44:33):
CSM is a customer success manager?

Sahil Mansuri (00:44:35):
Thank you. Sorry, sorry. I'm too jargony. Thank you. So typically most sales orgs are divided into pre-sales and post-sales. Pre-sales worked with companies that are not yet customers to get them to sign up. Post-sales works with companies that have already signed up to help them either find value or retain or renew or upsell. That's how most sales orgs are divided. Typically, you put your best people in pre-sales because it's harder. It's harder to sell a new customer than retain the one you have. That's always the case because you got to actually be able to build trust, build the relationship, evangelize something that they haven't bought before. 

(00:45:08):
So you typically take your best talent and put it in pre-sales, and then you take the people who are really good relationship builders and really caring and nurturing and not necessarily the people who are the most gifted at creating value or whatnot and you put them in CSM. That's obviously a huge generalization because I know many CSMs who are much better at sales and new business. In many businesses, it's actually harder to be a CSM because the product isn't very good. So you actually have to do a lot of selling even after the product is sold. So that was a big generalization. But it is, in broad strokes, true.

(00:45:44):
I would take your best account executives, pre-sales reps and I'd put them into CSM. I'd say it doesn't matter how much new business we work on in the next six to nine months because it's going to be hard anyway. But what we cannot under any circumstances do is lose our existing customers because replacing them is going to be impossible. So it's kind of like you got your leaky bucket, you got to patch that leak really, really fast and really hard. I think putting your best people on it is one good way to start.

(00:46:09):
Now, there's a lot of people who are going to listen to this and think that's crazy. Why would I take my best performer in a tough market and move them to post-sale? This is bad advice. Maybe. Maybe it's bad advice. I can't predict the future anymore than anyone else can. But I can tell you it's what we're doing. I can tell you I'm actually doing it. We're taking our best people and are moving them into CSM at Bravado. We're trying to maintain every customer we have because I believe that doing so sets us up for the best chance of success in the business. Maybe you disagree with that and you think that that's not right for you. You should do what's right for your business. 

(00:46:45):
But I would say that it's not just talk, it's action. I'm doing it. I'm also telling every one of my portfolio, I do a decent amount of angel investing, I'm telling everyone of my portfolio companies to do the same thing. Discussing the same thing with our investors, with our board as well. 

(00:46:58):
Okay so you put your best people on it. What else should you? So I think that what often goes underserved is the opportunity to help your customers themselves survive. I don't know. What's a good product example? Let's take something like a analytics product. Let's pick on Amplitude or Mixpanel or pick your favorite. If I was a company like that and I was like, "Okay, don't know how many new customers I may be able to sell, but I've got a lot of really good customers I want to keep." I would invest a tremendous amount of energy into helping product managers and product leaders get benchmarks and stats on how other product teams, what changes they're making. 

(00:47:46):
Because the advantage you have as a vendor, this is advantage we have in sales as Bravado, but it's the advantage that every vendor has is you get a cross=section of what everyone who fits a certain ICP is doing at the same time. How good are you at extracting value out of that and finding ways of becoming less of a tool as part of the SaaS stack and more of a value added advisor that can help you actually plan and prepare for what to do next. I think most companies are not good at it. They put out a white paper for lead gen. I want to put out a white paper for customer retention. 

(00:48:26):
One thing that we're actually doing is we're basically saying to all of our clients, "Hey, we'll tell you what percentage of companies that look like you are hiring or not hiring. I'll tell you how they're adjusting quotas. I'll tell you how they are changing their comp plans. I'll tell you how much they're paying. I'll tell you what percentage of their sales teams' hitting quota, et cetera, if you stick around with us as a client." I'm not just placing sales reps and say we make our business as a recruiting marketplace. So we help companies hire salespeople. Obviously that's slowed down tremendously because people are scared to hire and spend money right now. 

(00:49:03):
But if they're getting insights on what's happening in the market, that's still valuable. That's still something that they can't get elsewhere that I am uniquely positioned to offer to my customer base. What are you uniquely positioned to offer to your customer base? Let's pick another example that I think is really easy which is Greenhouse or Lever or another app and tracking system. If you're an ATS and all of a sudden every recruiting budget's getting slashed and recruiters are getting laid off faster than any other department because no one's hiring, et cetera, you're probably at the most risk of being ripped out or being downsized or getting downward pressure to your [inaudible 00:49:37].

(00:49:39):
Can you do that nobody else can do in order to give your customers a really good insight into how they should navigate thinking about hiring versus layoffs versus headcount versus burn per department, et cetera? You've got some really interesting data, don't you? You know exactly how many customers have paused, how many roles and whatnot. If I was Greenhouse, I would be putting out all kinds of reports that tell me, let's use me as a customer here, "Hey, of series B companies that have roughly 50 employees, they used to have eight open head count, but now they're down to four. The main area that they're investing are X, Y, and Z. Salaries are moving up and down."

(00:50:21):
You could get a lot of insight from a company like Greenhouse. Then I'd be like, "Whoa, this is so valuable. I can't live without this data because this is actually helping guide my business decisioning." I think moving from a world where you're just focused on how can I jam product down your throat to how do I use my unique perspective in the customer segment we serve in order to create broader insights for the industry is something I would heavily prioritize. I'd take my product marketing team and I'd kind of shift them to be my research team. I'd take a data analyst or two and stick them on the project and start to create content that is exclusive for my customers and have them see that as another point of value that they can get that would maybe help stay off chart.

Lenny (00:51:07):
I love that advice. Be helpful. Find ways to be helpful even if your core product isn't... Basically go above and beyond what you're already doing as a software product and find ways to help your companies be more successful. Feels like there's just a ton of nuggets you just shared. I want to make sure we also get to this other topic that I think is also going to have a lot of great nuggets, which is around just advice for closing deals in this time. You touched on a couple of these, warm intros, a couple things. Anything else you could share of just ways to increase the rate at which you close deals during this wild time in the market?

Sahil Mansuri (00:51:40):
This is a good segue because it'll bridge us back to where you just came from and hopefully move us forward, which is warm intros. So if cold outreach is going to be less effective, then what increases in efficacy in this time is, again, warm intros. So one thing you got to remember as a more general statement is that companies either grow or they die. There are no middle. There's no, "Oh, we're going to cut burn and just try to survive the winter long enough so that..." That doesn't work, right? Because employees get demoralized, investors lose faith, the days become long and the nights become longer and eventually you just run out of energy as a business. 

(00:52:20):
I think startups in particular are effectively energy driven. The more energy, the more belief, the more momentum that you have, the more tailwinds you have, the more things grow and feel possible. But of course if you look at the odds empirically, no startup should never begin because the odds are you're going to fail. That failure meets you in the eye over and over again as you're shrinking the size of your team, as you're shrinking the size of your budget, as you're doing fewer things and you're taking things away. 

(00:52:50):
So I don't really believe in this like, oh, we are just going to survive mentality. I think you have to adjust, of course. I think you have to be a realist. I'm not suggesting that you be blind to reality. I'm just suggesting you also have to keep the energy going. So what I mean by keeping the energy going is to say, "Okay, let's get..." So here's a couple ideas. First is let's cut a bunch of stuff but keep some money that we're going to invest in doing an in-person customer event. Okay, why do I think that's a good idea? 

(00:53:21):
I think it's a good idea because, first of all, we've all been stuck in our houses for a couple years and so when we get a chance to go on a trip for free somewhere, we tend to say yes. That's nice. Secondly, I think that you could be strategic and maybe have the trip be for customers only and in February or something. So maybe you survive the budget cuts this year because people are like, "Well, I got this great trip and I really don't want to miss it. Is there a way we can just keep this tool on?" You might think, "Oh, well, are you bribing customers or whatever?" 

(00:53:52):
I mean, it's just psychology. I think you have to use psychology to your advantage. I would do a big customer event in February, invite all my current customers and say, "Hey, as long as you're still a customer as of Feb 10, 2023, you're invited to this all paid trip to Napa to go drink a bunch of wine for a week." I bet that would probably meaningfully change your churn rate. Yeah, it's not going to change everything but it'll change something. I bet it would. Because at the end of the day, people are people. Sales is done by people. It's a belly to belly human sport. It's not just lines of code on a piece of paper.

(00:54:26):
You got to talk to another human, which is what makes it hard and unscalable and more of an art than a science. But also makes it really fun because it just plays by different rules, a different set of rules than many other things do. Recruiting being the other thing that is this. So in-person customer event. The other reason why I like in-person customer events is because they're a perfect opportunity for you to get new deals done. So how does that work? Does that mean I also invite prospects to the event?

(00:54:53):
No, actually I wouldn't do that. So I think a lot of companies do this where they'll invite customers and prospects to the same event. They're like, "Oh, commingle and sell each other." Not the smartest way to do it. You want only customers in the event and you want to use that again to share thought leadership and such. But then, during all the happy hours and the lunches and the late evenings and whatnot where you start to say, "Hey look, in this market you're finding value in our product. Who are one or two other folks that you know in the same position as yourself that might also find value? Who do you know that has the same problem? Who do you know that's going through this? Who do you know that might benefit from this research paper, et cetera?"

(00:55:30):
You just start collecting a bunch of warm interest. But then you don't just stop at getting the name because a lot of teams stop here. They'll basically get the name and then they'll be like, "Okay, got the name. Now I'm done." Actually not the right way to do it. You get the name and you say, "Great, can you make me an e-intro? Actually even better. Can you connect me over text?" So one tip that I have for all founders, all sales leaders, everyone out there, stop using email. Email is where deals go to die. Text message is where deals get done. 

(00:56:03):
So this notion that I'm going to e-intro you over email and that's how we connect is just far worse than the thing that I would really recommend, which I do all the time. We have a Webflow as a customer. I love Webflow. I know their sales leadership. We try to do a really good job for them. Anytime that their sales leader mentions a company that might be needing to hire or whatnot, my only response is, "Great, connect me over text." Then I get the text intro with the person. 

(00:56:31):
Here's the other fun part. I don't take the introer off the thread. So the other thing we tend to do is we CC the person who responded, but in text you don't need to do that. You can keep the person on a little bit and it holds the person's feet to the fire to actually show up for the meeting. Again, it's these little things, right? 2% here, 3% here. This is how you win in this economy. You got to do all the things right. So you keep the person on the thread long enough so that you've actually built that relationship for the first call, obviously not forever. But in the first 10, 20 messages, I'd keep the person on.

(00:57:06):
That allows you to ensure that the person goes to you, which happens a lot, I'm sure you know. You get an intro and the person never responds or they cancel on you. You can't get back on their calendar. You stay with them. This happened recently where I got introed from one sales leader to another and that sales leader basically then had a family or legit situation but then got busy and was like, "I'm not taking this thing." But I just kept pinging into that group every week or two for actually nine weeks. Then by two and a half months later, the person finally is like, "I'm so sorry, et cetera." Only after my original contact was like, "Yo, you're making me look bad here."

(00:57:45):
So that pressure is what forced... Then we got them as a customer and now things are good. So it just takes all that. It takes those little things. You got to build a bridge from your current customer base to future customers and parlay the goodwill, relationship, et cetera that you've earned in serving your current customers to get new ones. Because otherwise, I don't think it's just relying on a bunch of SDRs and cold emails and stuff is going to get you through the next six to 12 months.

Lenny (00:58:14):
I love that tip. Feel like there's probably more nuggets. I'm going to keep fishing in this well of tactical advice for closing deals. Is there anything else that you've found? I love that texting tip. I feel like I've been on the end of that one. It works great. So yeah.

Sahil Mansuri (00:58:30):
From me. Yeah, that's right. That's right. For example, I didn't have your phone number and I told my wife, "Make sure you take a selfie with Lenny and then send a text message to the three of us on one grad so that I know how to get a hold of Lenny in case he calls.".

Lenny (00:58:44):
Here we are now.

Sahil Mansuri (00:58:45):
Here we are now. That's right. But the point is sales when done well doesn't feel weird, okay? If it ever feels weird, you're a bad salesperson, right? I've been selling now for 14 years. I've sold literally hundreds, millions of dollars worth of deals. I could pretty much call any customer I've ever sold to and have a conversation with them and it would say, "How's it going?" Whatever. That's because I put a tremendous amount of energy into investing and building a real friendship, not relationship, not business, friendship with the people that I sell to.

(00:59:22):
So I'll tell you a couple of sales stories and maybe from that we can mine the nuggets that you're fishing for. I will tell you about how I sold to Facebook when I was at Glassdoor. This is a fun story. So Facebook was the Moby Dick of Glassdoor. I think the first time they tried to sell to them was end of 2008 or something like that. Facebook was one of those accounts that obviously should be on Glassdoor because the way Glassdoor's product worked is that the more people that came to your company page on Glassdoor, the more value there was for you as a recruiting firm to put branding and to put jobs and whatnot. 

(01:00:01):
Facebook was the most visited page on Glassdoor. So by virtue of that, it was the best account to sell to. It had gone from CEO to VP of sales to new VP of sales to rep to rep, et cetera. I finally got my hands on it Feb of 2011. The only reason I got my hands on it is because I closed Microsoft. I think I closed both Microsoft and Google at that point. But certainly at least Microsoft. Certainly at least Microsoft. Well, it's important to the story, not to brag. 

(01:00:32):
So I looked at it and I looked at who we are talking to, Lori Goler, who's the chief talent. I think she's still the head of talent there, but was the head of talent who we had pitched and every time we got the same response, "No, we are not interested in outside partnership at the time. No, we are not interested." I think she had a canned response for all vendors and it was just the same response in the CRM over and over again. So again, Einstein, right? Same thing over and over again, different result.

(01:00:58):
So I tried something different and I sat there and I went through every single review that had been written about Facebook on Glassdoor. First I had it pulled by a data scientist and did a word cloud and did a bunch of analytics on what was being discussed there. Pulled salary ranges, pulled salary ranges for Google and Amazon and Microsoft. So Glassdoor had three types of information. They had the review of the company, they had the outlook of the company and then they had the review of the CEO. 

(01:01:28):
So it was like, "Do you approve of Mark's handling the company? Yes or no?" Mark had I think 96% approval rate. He was one of the highest rated CEOs on Glassdoor at the time. I have no idea what it is today, but that's what it was then. So I basically called every review, all the salaries and then Mark's approval rating, and turned it into a nine page report that broke down how Facebook employees, specifically software engineers because that's what we're specialists at recruiting for, how software engineers at Facebook talked about working at Facebook and how it compared to how Google engineers talked about working at Google and whatnot, salary band comparisons and even reviews of Mark specifically versus the other CEOs of the other big tech companies.

(01:02:16):
Then sent an email to Sheryl Sandberg, a cold email to Sheryl Sandberg whose email address I did not have, but that I assumed had to be one of 15 things. So I think I put ssandberg@facebook.com in the two line and then in the BCC line put every variant I could think of, everything. I mean everything I could think of I put, underscores and dots and first name and last name and abbreviations and et cetera. The title of the email was Mark's approval rating on Glassdoor. 

(01:02:54):
I was like, "Hey Sheryl. I'm from Glassdoor. I was doing research on Facebook and comparing it to all the other big tech companies. I personally work with Microsoft. So I have a little bit of insight in this. Here's what your employees think about you. Here's what Mark's approval rating looks like versus others, et cetera, et cetera." This whole research report, I kind of broke out some highlights, a couple screenshots, attached the report and said, "Hey, I'd love to discuss this with you sometime."

(01:03:18):
I think I sent the email around 3 or 4PM on a Sunday. By 6PM I got a response back from Sheryl Sandberg CC'ing elt@fb.com or something like that, which I later found was executiveleadershipteam@facebook.com saying, "Hi Sahil, this is super interesting. We'd love to meet with you tomorrow. Are you available to come to Facebook HQ at 10AM.' So at the time I was 22, 23 years old or something like that. It was pretty new to Glassdoor anyway. So then of course I said yes. I sent the email to the CEO. He was like, "Do you want me to come and whatever?" I just said, "No, I'll handle it." I brought a customer success person and the two of us went.

(01:04:02):
We actually got to meet first with Sheryl and then I got to go to the fishbowl. I don't know if you know this story, but Mark had a famous office that was all glass in the middle so that he really played [inaudible 01:04:15] or whatever so his known as the fishbowl. So I got to go to the fishbowl. I met Mark Zuckerberg himself. As it turns out that report and that rating got added to their weekly packet because Mark wanted to know on a weekly basis how his rating and how the employees view of Facebook was, how it was changing week over week and what people were writing, et cetera, and it became a thing. 

(01:04:43):
I don't know if it's still a thing today, I have no idea. But I got to have this in depth strategic conversation with the executive leaders of Facebook around their reputation, what their employees thought, their pay bands, their interview questions, leadership, guidings, shared the word cloud, sentiment analysis, et cetera. Needless to say, of course, we closed a massive deal with them and whatnot. But that's the kind of shit it takes in order to close deals, right?

(01:05:12):
So this idea that I'm going to go onto my CRM system and fire up a hundred cold emails and I'm going to close business, that works when capital is cheap and everyone's buying everything and every rep hits quota and every company's growing, et cetera. That shit does not work when you are in tough times and desperate measures, you got to figure out a way to build your business. So what I would say is you got to really over, over, over index in the whole I'm going to teach you something, right? 

(01:05:41):
It's not that I'm going to give you value because that's a really weird thing to say and it's not like my product's going to solve a problem for you because, frankly, I don't know if you know what my problems are. But I think that one thing I would advise is how can I do something that will make this worth your time in a way that it isn't about buying my software or putting job ads on my site. So that's how Facebook became a customer of Glassdoor.

Lenny (01:06:06):
That is an insane story. I feel like those are moments that salespeople live for. How did you feel once you got that email that day? Were you just freaking nervous? Were you jumping up and down [inaudible 01:06:15] might work?

Sahil Mansuri (01:06:16):
I love to play chess. It's my favorite game. The reason I love chess is because I love to think a few moves ahead. I expected to get that email back. I knew when I sent the email that this was going to work. I was like, "There's no way this won't work." The only way it wouldn't have worked is if she never saw it. So if she sees this, she's going to respond because it would be crazy for her not to. The information on here was so good. So I felt a sense of satisfaction that I had played the game right in a way that no one else that my company had. No one else understood the psyche of the buyer. 

(01:06:49):
So to me, sales is I don't care about the commission. I've never cared about the money. I think this is true for most great salespeople. I think this is actually true for most people who are great at something is that they don't do it for the money. They don't do it for even necessarily the trophies or whatever. They do it because they love it. Winning, it's contagious, it's addictive and it's rewarding. Closing Facebook was a blast because I really got a chance to flex into something that I take a lot of pride in, which is being able to deeply understand my customers where they sit and how I can be not a sales rep, but someone who actually changes your perspective and how to do your job. That's what I live for.

(01:07:36):
So I think that's what you have to do in order to be a great salesperson is I think you have to be willing to go beyond just the, oh, I want to hit my quota or whatever. If you're a founder and you're trying to sell in this market, it's like how do I get my product in the hands of customers? You got to go beyond. How do I change the way you operate as a business? How do I do something that is transformative? That Glassdoor rating literally got added to the ELT report that went out every single week. That's the part of the story I'm proud of. 

Lenny (01:08:09):
You just mentioned that you don't do sales, that you're not a salesperson technically anymore. You run this company. Do you miss that job being a full-time salesperson?

Sahil Mansuri (01:08:19):
I think CEOs are full-time salespeople. I mean, think about the job of a CEO, right? Let's start from the infancy, right? Let's start from starting a company from scratch. First thing you got to do if you want to start a company is you have to convince yourself to do it. You got to sell yourself on the fact that you want to do this. This is where most people fail actually. They can't sell themselves. They're not able to convince themselves that they should take this leap. They don't believe in themselves enough to do it. 

(01:08:45):
So first you got to be good enough to sell yourself. Maybe that's delusional. I don't really know how to coin that, but let's just say sell yourself. You got to then sell other more talented people than yourself to join you at a time at which you have no money, often no idea, no traction, nothing. They're typically making a lot of money at a well paid... If you hire great founders, they have a choice somewhere to work and  you got to convince them to believe in you, believe in your idea, believe in the future that can be. This is the second place where most people fail. 

(01:09:15):
Assuming you do those two things, you still got to do one more thing, which is you got to actually sell an investor to give you capital based on typically virtually nothing or maybe very little attraction. Then you have to go and convince your initial customers to believe in you. Because sure as heck no startups product is great. Everyone wants to be like, "Oh we're going to go change the world." But you're not changing the world today, right? You've got 1/100th of the feature set of any of your competitors and all you have is this dream and this energy and this belief and somebody who's willing to take a bet on you. You got to get someone to be willing to bet on you. That's sales. 

(01:09:51):
Then if you do all that, then maybe you need to get some press. So now you got to convince a reporter to write about you and you got to be able to do that. Then maybe you need to hire some more people. So you got to convince some candidates to come work for you. I mean, spend my whole day selling. All I do is sales. All any founder does is sales. It's kind of like venture. People misunderstand this. VCs are salespeople. 100% of VC is a salesperson because they're selling LPs to give them money and they're selling CEOs to take their money in exchange for equity. That's the job of a VC. 

(01:10:27):
All the analytics, all the data and the this and the that, those are just updating their CRM. The core function of a VC is to sell. The core function of a CEO is to be a great salesperson. Like any great salesperson, you have to balance cynicism with optimism. Great salespeople don't have what I call happy ears. This is a problem that people misunderstand. People think that being a great salesperson is being ever the optimist. That's actually not the case because then you'll waste your time on a bunch of deals that'll never close. Great salespeople are extremely pessimistic internally and are great at being able to then still be optimistic externally.

(01:11:09):
Where they're actually trying to disqualify you. They're looking for signals that you're not going to buy and weeding those out, while still at the same time positively spinning you and selling you. That ability to juxtapose is what diverges good from great. Because good salespeople will get misled by customers who tell them they want to buy, but if you would really press harder, you'd understand that they can't or won't or whatever. So you waste your time on a bunch of companies that never buy versus great salespeople know how to prioritize and spend their time properly.

(01:11:39):
The same applies in venture. If you are a CEO who's fundraising, I cannot tell you, honestly Lenny, I can't tell you how many other CEOs I know get constantly misled by VCs where the VC says one or two good things and they're like, "Oh, they're definitely going to invest." As opposed to giving that VC every out to not continue the conversation. If they still are willing to talk to you after that, then that they're for real. I think that being a CEO and being a salesperson are the same job. Different forms of it, of course, different audiences, different products, et cetera. But ultimately they're the same thing. So no, I don't miss it. I do it every single day and I love doing it. I'm learning more and more every day from the failures and shortcomings I have.

Lenny (01:12:36):
It's very clear that you love doing it. It's so interesting just to watch the energy when you talk about sales. I rarely meet folks that do sales. So it's really fun to dive into all this stuff. We promised folks five topics, you've gone through four. The last one I wanted to touch on, and you've already talked a bit about this and maybe there's just a quick tidbit to add here is around just how important growth continues to be for companies at this stage. It's easy to be like, "No, the markets are tough. People are going to give us a little bit of a leeway because no one's going to be able to grow." Your point is it's still incredibly important. Is there something you want to add there before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Sahil Mansuri (01:13:13):
I guess there's just one last thing, which is innovation is often put to the side. People just try to do the things that everyone else is doing. So I'll tell you something that we did at Bravado as an example of this. So we run a recruiting marketplace and competing with LinkedIn and AngelList and hired and all the rest of it. Like all those companies, we have seen a massive slowdown in our business. Unlike those companies, we didn't take that as kind of the end of the road for growth for now. But instead said, "Okay, so let me put myself back in the perspective of my buyer, my customer who are often founders and CROs and CFOs."

(01:13:53):
Those are the people that tend to buy from Bravado because they're the people who care the most about growing revenue. I can't hire anymore full-time salespeople because the market is tough right now and I can't increase my burn or what, but I still want to get new customers. It's just I can't afford to hire full-time people. In fact, I might be forced to lay off my team. What do I do? We kind of just sat there with a think whiteboard and just said, "All right, let's put ourselves in this situation. What would you do?"

(01:14:22):
One of the things that I think would be really interesting is I'm actually willing to pay money to acquire customers. I just can't take the risk that I hire someone and they won't bring me customer. What if we created a 100% commission only sales role? It doesn't exist today in SaaS. It does exist in other places, it just doesn't exist in SaaS really. But what if we created a way for sales reps who can't find a full-time job because the market is slow and companies who can't hire a full-time sales rep but still want customers to work together on a commission only basis.

(01:14:57):
Now a year ago, this product would not have worked, right? Because the supply-demand equilibrium was so tilted where every company needed great sales talent and every sales rep was getting multiple offers. So in that world, this product makes no sense. But in a world in which you have far more sales reps who are looking for work and far fewer companies who are hiring, maybe we can create a new model of sales. 

(01:15:22):
If Airbnb and Uber grew dramatically during the pandemic and actually are somewhat counter cyclical businesses, because if you can't find a full-time job then you find gig work, what would we be able to do for our community that instead of putting them in a different field, lets them use the skills, the network and the expertise they already have in order to do the thing they want to do, but be able to do it in a down market as well. So we launched something called Bravado Flex, which is a way for companies and candidates to work together in a non full-time employment way. 

(01:15:57):
That can mean contract hire, it can mean a hundred percent commission, it can mean fractional work, it can mean small stipend plus milestone base. There's a bunch of different ways at work. Overnight, we went from having a massive slowdown to our business to one of the best months that we've ever had in company history, which was last month, and this month will be even better than that. So while our full-time recruiting business slows, our fractional business grows.

(01:16:25):
So I use that as an example of the type of innovation that companies should be thinking of. As well as if you are a company that is thinking of increasing revenue but doesn't have enough levers to pull, maybe this is one that you might want to explore. But I think it comes back down to that fundamental staring at the whiteboard being like, "If I'm a customer and I'm in this world, what can we do today to change the rules of the game?" Because sometimes the rules of the game are stacked against you. As a recruiting business, the rules to the game were now stacked against us. 

(01:17:00):
No one's got money. People don't want to hire. There's hiring freezes, et cetera. There's more candidates in the market than ever before. Companies are going to be less and less likely to want to pay us to recruit for them. There's nothing I can do about that. I mean, I can stick my head out the window and scream and cry and complain, but that ain't going to get me anywhere either. So what I need to do is change the rules of the game and start to think about the problem differently.

(01:17:23):
I think that not enough founders do that. They just kind of bash their heads against the wall with the same kind of preconceived notions of what success may or may not look like. So I would really advise, and I'll give you some examples of where this goes beyond Bravado Flex, but change your pricing strategy. Now, let's say that you sell a product and it's $12,000 per year. Try charging a thousand dollars a month and going month to month. Try charging 20 bucks a day and going day by day. Then you might be like, "Well, wait a minute. That just changes to every..." But you have to adapt, right? 

(01:17:51):
If your old model is not going to work, it's asinine to just sit there and then try to make minor changes like, "Oh, instead of 12 we'll reduce price to 10 or something." People try to optimize their way out of problems. You can't optimize your way out of a problem. You got to completely change the rules of the game. In doing so, you suddenly will learn something new. Bravado Flex may not work forever. Who knows? But maybe, just maybe, as we've been doing this, we've realized that there's actually a lot of sales reps that prefer this because they can do flex for multiple companies. 

(01:18:26):
So all of a sudden we learn something really new, which is that our audience are the same candidates that we're replacing to full-time jobs, are actually in some cases preferring doing this fractional work. Because now they don't need to go to all the meetings and they don't need to update Salesforce. They don't need to do all the boring shit that sales reps don't like to do. Instead, they can just work for three companies, use the existing network they have, get meetings set up for all of them, pitch the best product to the right customer, and all of a sudden they feel like instead of having to pitch the one hammer that you need to use for every... They have a wide tool set that they can bring to their customers.

(01:19:01):
All of a sudden companies are like, "Well, wait a minute, this is actually pretty cool because now instead of just hiring one person at a time and training them, I can hire 10 people at a time and I can have multiple kind of fish in..." So we just changed the rules of the game around sales hiring as a market. I think that's the sort of innovation that you have to bring to the market if you want to survive in the downturn, which you can't just sit there and just try to do the same stuff over and over and over again. You got to really be willing to break all preconceived notions of what success looks like, innovate something new and then take bigger swings I guess is the thing I would say.

Lenny (01:19:38):
That's a very empowering way to close out our chat. But first, we reached the very exciting lightning round. I'm going to ask you five questions. I'll go through them pretty fast. Whatever comes to mind, fire it away. Does that sound good?

Sahil Mansuri (01:19:53):
That sounds great.

Lenny (01:19:54):
What are some books that you recommend to other people, like two or three, maybe even one book that you most recommend to other people?

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:01):
There's one book that I think every person should read. It's called Stumbling Upon Happiness.

Lenny (01:20:05):
Yeah, Dan Gilbert I think is the author.

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:07):
Yeah, that's right. That's right. It's a really fun book. A lot of interesting studies and readings. I think especially if you're a founder or an executive who wants to learn how to sell and wants to understand how your buyers make decisions, I think it's really impactful and teaches you a new way to think about sales using psychology.

Lenny (01:20:24):
Great pick. Second question. Favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:29):
There's actually only two other podcasts I listen to, so it's a small choice. I listen to the All In podcast because I love the fact that they have really good show notes so I can just jump to the section that I want to hear them talk about instead of listening to like-

Lenny (01:20:42):
We got those show notes here too.

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:43):
That's right. I'm excited for that as well. Of course, I listen to yours, but I figured that was too on the nose.

Lenny (01:20:48):
It's off limits.

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:50):
On the nose, yeah. Then the other one is the How I Built This.

Lenny (01:20:54):
Great choices. What's a recent favorite movie or a TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Sahil Mansuri (01:20:59):
I don't watch a lot of TV or movies. but I would say that a strong exception to that is I really like The Blacklist, if you've seen that show. But it's a pretty good one. James Spader. Yeah, I really love James Spader. I find him to be someone I really, really like. I'm also a big fan of Aaron Sorkin so I liked The newsroom a lot and then West Wing and whatnot. I think the thing is I really nerdy stuff like Jeopardy and Frasier. I never liked Friends. I think it's just the dork in me that I like to watch nerdy stuff.

Lenny (01:21:34):
Final question, what are five SaaS products that you find incredibly useful at your company, especially new ones? But if not, anything that are just I love these products.

Sahil Mansuri (01:21:45):
I'm a huge Luddite because my favorite tools to use are pen and paper. I like to write by hand. I like to write on a whiteboard. I enjoy the tactical part of that. I've tried to use the reMarkable tablet and other stuff like that, but I don't get the same pleasure of writing on actual pen and paper. That's my favorite. I mean, in terms of tools that we use it at Bravado that are hugely impactful, I mean, Slack is the central OS of our business as I'm sure it's for many others. Obviously we use Zoom a lot to meet and that's a core one. 

(01:22:17):
Noshell operates everything for us as well. So I don't think I'm saying anything that that's exciting here. There's a product called Grain that I really like that I think is really cool. Grain allows you to make clips of Zoom meetings and send them out. The reason I really like that is because if I have a customer call, if I have a user interview or a VC call or whatnot, I can take a snippet of something that someone said and let other people hear it from their words. I think that's really powerful and something that I really enjoy.

Lenny (01:22:47):
Great.

Sahil Mansuri (01:22:47):
Maybe that one.

Lenny (01:22:48):
Great. Love it. Sahil, this was amazing. I feel like I want to be a salesperson now. You infected me, but I still would be really bad at it. But there's a lot of nuggets in this episode that would make me less bad. So thank you for that. 

Sahil Mansuri (01:23:02):
I'm going to jump in. You've said that once. you've said that once to me before and I can't let you end on that note because it's not fair because Lenny, you are a salesperson and you are one of the best that I have met. The reason why that's true is because you have built a business from the ground up. I didn't know who the heck you were a couple years ago now. Maybe you had a big brand more than a couple years ago too, and I was just the idiot. But everybody I know now knows and respects you. The reason for that is because, I mean, I think you have really deep knowledge on product. I think there's probably other people that have really deep knowledge on product too.

Lenny (01:23:02):
Many, many more.

Sahil Mansuri (01:23:41):
But you are the best at marketing that and turning that into... You got distribution around it. You've given so much to the world of product and been kind of a bright light that so many people have gravitated around and such so that when you launch Lenny's Talent Collective or Lenny's whatever podcast or whatever's the latest Lenny thing, in fact I remember you did a poll to try to figure out what should be the name of this podcast and ultimately the thing that one was Lenny podcast I think. So I think that is the core of sales. 

(01:24:15):
I want to go back to the first principle, which is that sales when done well does not feel salesy. Sales when done well is a delightful experience. People love paying you money. People love consuming your content because it's good. That's what makes a great salesperson. Facebook didn't regret taking that meeting with me. Facebook didn't regret signing that contract. They enjoyed it, they liked it, they were happy for it and it felt delightful to them and that's how sales should feel. 

(01:24:47):
So this notion that the way you're good at sales is because you're super extroverted and pushy and willing to put yourself out there and whatever is a misguided notion. You are the future of sales. If every salesperson gave a ton of value, played the long game, nurtured their community and created products and services based on the feedback from their customers, the world would be such a better place. So don't sell yourself short, my friend. I think you are a phenomenal salesperson.

Lenny (01:25:16):
Damn. What a way to end it. I so appreciate that. I'm going to deflect from this epic compliment and move on to closing this out, but I really appreciate that. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more about you, Bravado and how can folks be useful to you?

Sahil Mansuri (01:25:32):
First of all, you can just email me. I'm just sahil@bravado.co. I love responding to emails and meeting people, so I'm always down for that. Secondly, you can find me on LinkedIn where I regularly post content around sales and revenue and hitting targets and all that. Then lastly, if you want to learn more about Bravado, it's just bravado.co. Sign up and check it out. If you like something, let me know. If you don't like it, then please let me know so we can make it better.

Lenny (01:25:59):

# How to be more innovative | Sam Schillace (Microsoft deputy CTO, creator of Google Docs)

## Transcript

Sam Schillace (00:00:00):
We tend to undervalue the things we're good at. We tend to think work has to be unpleasant. And so if something is easy and fun, we don't tend to think it's valuable. So I think lots of people gravitate in this direction of like, let's go do unpleasant things and grind our way through the career because that's the way to make it. But the reality is you should go do the thing that you feel guilty to get paid for, if there's a thing like that, and do the hell out of it, right? Do it as hard as you can. If you get pleasure from doing something that people want to pay you for, do it the best you can do it, as hard as you can do it. And if that's messing around and playing around with cool ideas, do the hell out of that. Work doesn't necessarily have to be hard.

Lenny (00:00:37):
Today my guest is Sam Schillace. Sam has an incredible resume that is very hard to summarize succinctly. I'll give it a shot. Currently, he is corporate vice president and deputy chief technology officer at Microsoft, where he leads efforts in the consumer product space, infrastructure, and AI. Sam is most known for basically inventing Google Docs with his company Writely, which was acquired by Google, and became the foundation for what is now Google Workspace, which currently has over one billion active users a month. 

(00:01:06):
After joining Google, Sam ended up responsible for many of Google's consumer applications, including parts of Gmail, Maps, Automotive, Groups, Reader, and more. He's also founded six startups, was senior vice president of engineering at Box through their IPO. He's also worked at Intuit, Macromedia. He was even a VC at Google Ventures for a time. As you'd suspect, we had a fairly wide-ranging conversation, but the core focus was around innovation, how to think big, how to come up with original ideas, why optimism is so important and powerful, and also a ton of career advice. Sam is hilarious and not what I imagined a corporate vice president at Microsoft would be like, which gives me even more respect for Microsoft. A big thank you to Brett Berson for making this introduction. With that, I bring you Sam Schillace, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:57):

Sam Schillace (00:03:51):
Thank you. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:03:53):
A really fun fact about you is that apparently you have the very first Google Doc file. I don't know what you call it. The very first Google Doc document saved somewhere from before even Google Docs was a thing. And does it still work in today's Google Docs? And what is in this document?

Sam Schillace (00:04:08):
Yeah, it does actually still work. It's pretty funny. Actually, if I move my camera for a second you might, if you're on YouTube, you can see the Writely thing in the background. Writely was the company that did Google Docs. Yeah, it still works. And it's funny though because it's like the document of DCS, right? So we started off 2005, wrote this thing in C#, which is a little known, in our own... It was pre-cloud, so we had three file servers that we rented that were Windows machines in a data center in Texas with a sysadmin in the Philippines running them. So it started there.

(00:04:43):
And then when we moved to Google, we ported everything to Java, we moved all the data over into Bigtable. And we didn't lose anything. We never lost anybody's stuff. So it's still there and moved across. And then so that's one backend migration, and there's another one with Spanner. And then the front end has been rewritten twice as well. So it's like, is it really the same document? I don't know. The front end, back end have been rewritten. It's not much. It's just me saying something to Steve about, is collaboration working? Are we colliding on each other? Because we were trying to figure out typing on one line, if that algorithm was working.

(00:05:14):
And then there's a picture of Edna from The Incredibles pasted into it. I don't know why. I think that came after, so I might've gone back and pasted that in. I'm not sure when. We must've been testing pictures or something. Unfortunately, we don't have the version history anymore, so I don't know what was original, original. But it is the oldest Google Doc from October 2005 or something like that.

Lenny (00:05:34):
I love that this philosophical answer of, is it still the same Google Doc, considering all the code has been redone.

Sam Schillace (00:05:42):
Well, the Computer History Museum wants to curate it. I talked to these guys and they were like, "Oh, that's so cool. We'll take that." I'm like, "How?" I can make you a PDF. Now it's not the document. I can share you into it, but please don't edit it. How do you curate this? So that's funny.

Lenny (00:05:58):
Yeah. It needs to be on the blockchain.

Sam Schillace (00:06:00):
Yeah. Yeah. If you made the NFT of it, that would be more authentic, I think, than the document almost. It's kind of funny.

Lenny (00:06:07):
That's amazing. And it's amazing that it still works. That's a testament to, I don't know, you/Google.

Sam Schillace (00:06:12):
Well, I'll tell you a quick Google story. When we migrated in to Google, we were very sneaky about it, and we put the site into "maintenance mode" for eight hours on a Sunday, where everything was just read-only. And then we migrated all the data and moved everything and brought the new system up. And three days after that, Sergei was in a meeting with me and he's like, "So when are you guys going to move over to Google infrastructure?" And I got to tell them, "Oh yeah, we did it this weekend." No one noticed. Some blogger in Germany noticed that the IP address changed and that was it. Nobody noticed it at all, so we were really good about it.

Lenny (00:06:46):
Man, I love these sneaky stories. I'm hoping we hear more. There's a bunch of stuff I want to cover, the first is this broad idea of disruptive innovation. I know that you spend a lot of time thinking about this. Google Docs is a great example of this. It feels like Microsoft increasingly is getting really good at this. Just the idea of doing something completely new, oftentimes things that people didn't think were possible. So let me just ask a broad question. Why is this important to you? Why do you spend a lot of time thinking about this? And then just what are some tools you've found to help you and other people think more innovatively, more originally?

Sam Schillace (00:07:18):
It's an interesting question. The why it's important part, I don't know, it just is. Everything you're wearing, eating, using, listening to, sitting on, was a disruptive innovation at some point. That's how everything happens, right? I think there's this really interesting thing where everything new is threatening at some level at the beginning. I mean, probably literally the first guy who invented chairs got shit from his tribe mates for making a chair. And they're all obvious in retrospect, right? Everything is obvious in retrospect.

(00:07:51):
But I think there's this really deep thing that people have where if something is disruptive of your worldview, it feels threatening, and you have this very stark choice to make that's either you're wrong or it's wrong. And humans are storytellers. It's very easy for us to tell stories about why something is right or wrong if we're motivated to. And so I call these why-not questions. People ask these why-not questions a lot. So a new thing pops up, and if you're not ready to receive it for some reason, you're not already half there or you don't have a problem that it solves or whatever, it's just threatening and irritating, and you come up with a why-not question.

(00:08:29):
We heard a bunch of these with Google Docs, with Writely, in the early days about the browser wasn't ready, people wouldn't... The whole model of the cloud was like, people aren't going to trust you to store your files. That's really weird. What if there's no connectivity? I heard the no connectivity on an airplane story 100 times from journalists. Like, "What if I'm on an airplane and I write stuff?" I'm like, "I don't know. There'll be connectivity on airplanes soon." Which there is. And those are all just why-not questions.

(00:08:55):
I think the more interesting ones are the what-if questions, like, what if this does work? Just use your imagination. Think about, how far can I extend the curve? What are the implications of that? I'm an engineer, and engineers are fundamentally pessimistic people. Somebody once told me engineers come into the world broken. They just look at everything as a problem to be solved. And I think there's something to that. But I feel like I've missed out more by being pessimistic than I have by being too optimistic too early.

(00:09:26):
So I have this kind of mantra now that there's just not that much of a prize for being pessimistic and right, particularly in a moment like this. It's much better to be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right, I think. So I don't know. And I'm an impatient person. I'm a creative person. I'm a messy person. I just like to create and explore and find stuff. So disruptive innovation just seems natural to me. But I think it's not an exaggeration to say, literally, that wheat you had in your bread this morning, if you eat bread, some weirdo was messing around with plants 1,000 years ago and everybody thought he was a nut, or she was a nut, and then we had wheat because somebody... Just everything, right? Everything is like that.

Lenny (00:10:12):
Along the same lines, I was actually just working on a post around first-principles thinking. And I found this quote from Steve Jobs just reminding us that everything around us was designed by some person that wasn't necessarily that much smarter than you. And there's no reason there isn't a better way. It just happens to be the way it is today.

Sam Schillace (00:10:26):
Yeah. One of the other ones that I like to keep in mind is every new idea looks dumb at first. Unfortunately, the dumb ideas also look dumb at first. It's not a perfect [inaudible 00:10:35]. But the more disruptive they are, the more dumb you're going to feel they are. You always listen for stuff like if they say it's a toy or if it's practical or it's stupid or I don't get it or whatever, those are often... Toy is a good keyword. If you hear people saying something's a toy, that's often a really good signifier that it's actually something real and threatening, and they can't think of a better criticism for it than it's just a toy right now.

Lenny (00:11:01):
Yeah, I imagine people thought about Google Docs that way initially. It was like, "Oh, this little toy in the browser."

Sam Schillace (00:11:06):
Yeah, we got all this stuff. I mean, the real interesting thing, like I said at the beginning, you have this very binary reaction that's possible, right? You either understand it, in which case, you're super excited about it like, "Cool, the world's going to change in this exciting way." Or you don't and you reject it. And to the degree that something is really disruptive, that reaction, that binary reaction gets really strong. And so with something like G Docs, we got this thing with G Docs that was really confusing in the early days to me, where there was a small group of people that really liked it. Some of them liked it more than we liked it. Nate Torkington over at Writely was this super huge early booster for it. And I did not understand what he saw in it at first. But then we had people that just wanted it to die in a fire. 

(00:11:52):
And that bifurcation of love it, hate it, is really how you have an idea of whether you have impact in what you're building. If you get more of the bell curve of modern indifference and maybe mild like and mild dislike, that's an's an incremental product. That's not really disrupting anything. But if you look at something like ChatGPT where the entire world is like, "This is amazing." Or, "This is terrible." And there's not a whole lot in between, that's a very good signifier of it being truly impactful and disruptive. Whether it's actually good or bad is a separate question. But there's no denying that that's a disruptive technology.

Lenny (00:12:33):
That's an awesome framework. Basically, if it feels like people sort of like it, mostly people don't care, very few people love it or hate it, probably not disruptive. If some people absolutely love it and a lot of people really hate it, good sign.

Sam Schillace (00:12:45):
Right. Yeah. Actually, weirdly enough. It's not voting, right? In the early days, we had, I don't know, a couple of million users, five million users, and there were still executives at Google telling me that it was a stupid idea and that it should stop and we shouldn't be doing it. So, for a long time, the haters outnumbered the people who were fans. And who cares? Whatever. It's fine. As long as you don't run out of the people who love it, that's fine.

Lenny (00:13:18):
Is there another example of you using this what-if approach either on a product you worked on or something you've seen and it working out?

Sam Schillace (00:13:25):
I'm doing a lot of it right now, honestly. I mean, that's probably the most immediate example. But I could almost point at any product and there's moments like that in there. But right now there's a lot of why-not stories, right, around generative AI. So it's expensive, it hallucinates, you can't necessarily... It's sarcastic, it's random, it doesn't do the same thing twice. Yeah, they're real, they're actual issues to solve, but I look at it and think, "Well, what if? What if we can build software around it? What if we can build more complicated programs than what we've been able to build? What if we actually have a reasoning engine that we can use to do meaningful things? What if this is really the second Industrial Revolution where, in the first one, we had a surplus of physical energy beyond just our bodies and things like water reels, and now we have a surplus of cognitive energy beyond just our brains, right?"

(00:14:17):
And that's a really transformational idea. So I'm completely in that mode right now, honestly. I think that's just the right mindset for something that's obviously this disruptive, right or wrong. Tesla is a great example. SpaceX is a great example where people are like, "That doesn't make any sense." And Elon's like, "Well, what if you could land rockets and reuse them and they get really cheap? That's pretty amazing. What if I can fix the battery problems and a car is basically a software product, right?" Those are pretty amazing what-if questions, right, of those products.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Yeah. So in this work on understanding what first principles actually looks like when you're thinking from first principles, the steps are essentially, figure out what you want to do, figure out the levers that keep you from achieving that thing, and then basically question every assumption that stands in the way of making this possible. So I think Elon's a great... The classic example. You can't talk about first-principles thinking without quoting Elon, telling stories of Elon. But essentially, it's just, okay, how much would it cost to make this if we were to start over and not...

Sam Schillace (00:15:16):
I mean, the why-nots, there are actually problems you need to pay attention to eventually to build stuff. But once you have the what-if, right, just to pick on SpaceX for a second, right? If you have what-if of like, "If I could make payload to space cost a lot less, what if?" Okay, that's amazing. That's an amazing world. Let's see if we can work on that problem. And then now you have all the why-nots? Why not? Why isn't it as cheap as it could be? And you can start to break the problem down and think about it that way. It's a good model.

Lenny (00:15:46):
This connects to something else that I know you're big on, which is optimism, being optimistic. There's this feeling that pessimism, you're often right. There's growing pessimism in the world in a lot of ways, especially in technology. I know you're a big proponent of staying optimistic. Can you just talk about why you think that's important and how you approach that?

Sam Schillace (00:16:06):
It's funny, it's a choice. I'm not an optimistic person by nature. I'm just not. All the people in my life, if any of them listen to this, they'll just laugh at the idea that I'm a proponent for optimism per se. It's just a conscious choice. I don't think you get very much for being pessimistic necessarily. You definitely don't get a lot for being careless. You can be optimistic to the point of being careless and causing harm, for sure.

(00:16:33):
Maybe a better way to say it is growth mindset, right? You want to look at the possibilities rather than the limitations, and suspend some disbelief and just work on these problems. I just personally feel like I've missed out on more than I've protected myself from. If I sum up both sides of that equation over my career, I wish I had been more open-minded and more optimistic, and more willing to try things, and more focused on possibilities rather than problems.

(00:17:00):
And so I'm just personally choosing to do that, try to do that as a habit. Nothing deeper than that. I just think it's a better place to be, particularly... It's kind of funny. When I came out here, I was pre-med. I dropped out of school. I came out to be a computer scientist with my friend. I didn't think of it that way. I came out to have a job at Ashton-Tate with a friend of mine, and spent 10 years not understanding that I was actually in a career and thinking that it was a temporary thing where I had to go back to med school and get my degree and be a doctor or something boring like that. And so for 35 years of doing this, it hasn't occurred to me that, oh, actually, I'm in this computer industry that's this technical industry that's constantly growing and constantly inventing things and constantly coming up with these new ideas. And actually, the best posture in that world is to be creative and curious and open and optimistic and try things and stuff like that.

(00:17:54):
The other thing I'll say about optimism too is related to doing these disruptive things like G Docs. Going back to this idea of all the good ideas look bad at first. Okay, so that's a first principle. That's a sort of fundamental thing of you're going to constantly be challenged by the really good ideas. So how do you overcome it? Well, one way you can overcome it is you want to be able to try things more easily. So part of that is being more optimistic, so being more willing to try stuff, and part of it is also just making it cheaper to try things.

(00:18:26):
Very early story of G Docs, when I had the idea for Writely, my two co-founders who were both deep domain experts in both app building and word processors were like, "The browser is never going to support this. It's a bad idea. Let's not do this." And they were right and wrong at the same time. They were right that it didn't support even what we have today and wouldn't have supported a full experience, but wrong in that the world was going to change and evolve. And we would never have done the first experiment if it had been a long and costly thing to do, right?

(00:18:58):
So the fact that our tools were sharp and I could say, "Let's do this thing." And it only takes a couple of days to get it on its feet and see how it feels, it's kind of a form of optimism, right? If you're super pessimistic, you can be like, "Even that's not worth it. Two days is a waste of time." So there's always a little bit of a leap of faith. And then you want to make those as consumable as possible. You want to be able to try things out quickly and learn things and do these experiments. 

(00:19:23):
Now, lots of people have said that before, but I think all those pieces connect for me in this idea of being optimistic and open to trying stuff. Because stuff always is different. You're always wrong about products. That's one of my other rules is you're just always wrong. And so you have to try it. You have to put it in front of people. You have to try it yourself before you'll understand it. No one can really design products in their head completely as far as I can tell.

Lenny (00:19:47):
Awesome. There's a few threads I want to follow there. But this is also a tool that I found came up again and again in first-principles thinking, people that are really good at this, is just trying it. There's a lot of just, "Nah, it's not going to work." And exactly as you just described, you often find out you're completely wrong when you actually try it out. And you have this quote, I think in one of your newsletter posts, talking about building Google Docs. You describe it as just fuck around.

Sam Schillace (00:20:12):
Yeah. Kind of.

Lenny (00:20:13):
Get to the edge of something and fuck around. That's the strategy.

Sam Schillace (00:20:15):
Yeah. Yeah. Get to the edge is only... Get your tools as sharp as you can get them to be. Make it so that you can try lots of cheap experiments, right? And just mess around and see what happens, see what pops out. And just try to be observant. I think the other part of optimism too is there's a receptiveness to it, right? If you're very pessimistic, you might miss the surprising result that pops out of an experiment. You might force yourself to do a bunch of experiments grudgingly, but you're like, "You know what? I hate this. I'm doing four experiments today because I have to do it because I want to be an entrepreneur, but it sucks and everything's miserable and black." And then you won't notice that, oh, this thing didn't work, but it didn't work in an interesting way. And you're more receptive to that kind of surprising thing, I think, when you're in an optimistic frame of mind. Like, "Oh, let's see how far I can get with this. Oh, it's not working, but why isn't it working? Well, that's kind of interesting. It broke here."

(00:21:04):
And we've done stuff like that in some of the things, the projects I've got going in Microsoft right now, we've got a chatbot thing we've been working on for a while and with memory, long-running memory so that you can have long conversations with it. And they work okay, but they don't work great in some ways. And we were trying to get multiple versions of them working together, like multi-agents working together. And we gave them whiteboard working memory as a shared working memory thing to fix this problem. And that turns out to make them much smarter. Don't know why. It just makes them smarter. So that was one of these nice little bits of discovery where if you're in a pessimistic frame of mind, you might've said, "Well, these don't work that well, let's give up on it." More optimistic frame of mind was like, "Well, let's try to give them a whiteboard just like a person and see if they cooperate better." And it turns out they really do. So another example of that mindset.

Lenny (00:21:54):
Along this thread, I was going to ask about this earlier, but there's a lot of technologies people get optimistic about. Crypto comes to mind, not that there's nothing there, but a lot of people got really optimistic and then it turned out there wasn't really a lot of business to be built and then things entered wintertime. Is there anything you've learned that gives you a signal that, "Lets keep working, I'm going to stay optimistic about this thing?"

Sam Schillace (00:22:15):
I spent a lot of time really thinking hard about crypto and whether I was just reacting to it because it threatens some part of my identity or whatever. And I never came down to anything that seemed valuable. I mean, that was always the thing for me is just there has to be a what if that I can say, "Well what if this works? How valuable is it?" And for crypto I was always like, "Well what if it works? Then I have to run up sec on my personal finances. That sounds dystopian. I don't want that." I can't think of anything as a user that I think actually is valuable here, even in the best case. So I feel like the pessimism is justified. 

(00:22:53):
So that's one of my other root principles is just like it's all about user value. Users are lazy, right? We're all lazy. We don't really care that much at the end of the day. No one's going to do something really in their life for any other reason other than it makes their life better. Nobody cares that you're friendly or nice or the logo is pretty or whatever. They care about making their life easier. We're all cynical at heart at some level, so if you can't point at user value, significant user value, it's not going to work. It doesn't matter. Shove all the marketing dollars into it you want, you can write all the articles you want, but it's got to actually solve a problem, a real problem, at the end of the day. I just never saw that with crypto.

Lenny (00:23:34):
Yeah. So I think the lesson there is truly understand if the value is real, versus, this sounds really cool, you think a lot of... Would you want it? I think is a nice exercise there.

Sam Schillace (00:23:43):
We pick on poor Elon, but I feel like with a lot of his products, at least he... He's got lots of other issues, but he articulates clear user value even in the beginning when he's hyping things up. Like Teslas, right? Okay, so electric cars weren't ready, he did the Roadsters, whatever. But he at least articulated this idea that we're going to put a lot of batteries in these things. They're going to really be real cars. They're going to have a real range. We're going to figure out the charging problems. As an end user I'm like, "Okay, that's great. Now I have a car that works like a car that solves some problems that's way cheaper to operate, because the fuel is cheaper. He's solving all the end user problems for me." That at least makes sense. Even if you don't believe that he's going to do it or believe in the way he did it, at least the end user value proposition makes sense, right?

Lenny (00:24:32):
You have this other great quote in your newsletter, "People are lazy. Look beyond cool too, on how much easier new tool or tech makes someone's life. Convenience always wins." Can you talk about that, just this realization people are just lazy and that's the key?

Sam Schillace (00:24:44):
Yeah, well I mean that is the thing. I think as product builders, it's hard to not love what you're doing. You build a product because you love it, you build it because you understand some problem, you build it because you want a paycheck maybe sometimes. But we build it for all these reasons that just do not matter to the end user at all. And if there's one thing I've learned about product, particularly in the consumer space, just kind of in general, is people are just lazy about stuff and don't care about anything other than it making their life better. The thing that's complicated with that is there's two things about it that I think are interesting that follow from that principle. One is, I think products almost follow these thermodynamic rules where if you add a little bit of value, your adoption goes slowly and if you add a lot of value, your adoption goes really quickly, right? 

(00:25:32):
I think ChatGPT is a great recent example of something that was just added a ton of new value to the world and got this explosive growth, and then you see lots of other AI stuff that people are doing that's just not bad, but not great, and it's sort of kind of adding a little bit of value and slowly lumbering along, or maybe it's going to collapse under its weight. That's one thing about the users are lazy part of this. And then the other one I think is, again, it's almost like physics. I think of this as entropy, or people who are confused about entropy or will be like, "Entropy is not real. Look, it runs backwards all the time on earth. Life gets more complicated. What is the deal with entropy?" And like, "Well no, you have to consider the whole system, right? The entire system of the solar system, including the sun is increasing in entropy all the time. We're just making use of some of it."

(00:26:24):
And I think the same thing is kind of true about user laziness, where people are like, "This tiny thing that I'm focusing on, this feature that I added is better. Therefore, users should adopt it." But you forget all the stuff around it. The user has to hear about it, the user has to remember it in the moment. The user has to learn how to use it, they have to build the habit. That's all effort, right? Not to mention the fact that the actual use of your feature might have friction on the way in, right? It might be hard to sign up for it. 

(00:26:50):
When we did Writely at the beginning, we didn't even ask for an email address, because it was such a novel thing. We didn't want any friction at all in the onboarding process. So you could just come in and make a document and start using it without telling us anything at all about yourself. And after about two minutes of typing, if you're still there, we'd very gently just say, "Please give us your email address, no password, no anything. Just give us your email address so we can send you a URL of this document in case you care about it later. Because if you leave, we'll never know where... We'll never be able to find it again." 

(00:27:21):
But we were super focused on that, as little friction as possible. And I think it's well known in the consumer space, you don't have... The number of seconds you have is not many. 15 seconds, 30 seconds, right, to convince somebody that there's some value there. They're not going to hang out and grind their way through a bunch of high-friction stuff to sign up for your thing. That's the other part of it is just, users will only adopt what you're doing if that sum total of energy that they have to expend is less than the resulting ease in their life that they get, usually by a factor of at least a couple, right? So it has to make your life a lot better, hopefully a really a lot better, like 10X better than what you spend to use it.

Lenny (00:28:10):
What I think of as you're describing this is, Microsoft Excel had a billion toolbars and buttons and options, which allowed Google Docs essentially to come in with a much simpler experience. Now you're on the other side of that, which is I didn't think about.

Sam Schillace (00:28:25):
Yeah, it's a really funny place to be. And it's funny to be at Microsoft, because I'm kind of the enemy, right? Because I'm the guy who messed them up a little bit. So there's some friction around that. Yeah, I mean I think there are similar trade-offs to be made right now, by the way, with AI. I think there's similar opportunities. But we made this choice with... So it's a little hard to remember, right? Because it's like 18 years, 17 years ago now, 18 years ago almost. In that era, Office was impregnable, right? So software had to be distributed physically, right, it had to be shipped around, it had to be bought and installed. It was harder to use.

(00:29:01):
And so there's a very high transactional cost. Because there's a very high transactional cost, the buyers would always make this decision like, "Do I want the thing with 1,000 features or the thing with 995 features? I don't know what those last five are, but I might as well have all of them." And so that was just the lock-in for Microsoft, right? So we made this trade-off, we're like, "Look, we're easy to use, we're zero install, you don't have to ever deal with it, it's super convenient. Plus you get this one new feature that's really, really useful, which is collaborating with each other and not having to send attachments around the old file servers, but we're going to take away most of the features, because we don't care about them that much." 

(00:29:39):
And we took away a little bit more than we should have. In the early days, we'd get all these complaints about people who wanted word count, which I thought was a really weird... I thought that was going to be way at the end of the list. We didn't have rulers, we didn't have any kind of formatting at that point, any real pagination. We just had these basic documents. But page word count came in, of course it was students, was one of our early adopters. So they really wanted to know if they were at the word count for the essay that they had just had assigned to them.

(00:30:06):
So there was this dance with Microsoft that we deliberately made this trade-off. And I think it's almost like a classic innovator's dilemma model, right? We had this incumbent that was asymptotically approaching usefulness, they're adding stuff. Whenever they added stuff, it wasn't really that much more valuable. And then we were this small thing that came in into a market that they didn't care that much about, that they didn't understand that well, which is the internet stuff, this disruptive new thing. We just chipped away from the bottom, like the innovator's dilemma. And I think it was hard for Microsoft to respond to it. I think it took them a while to even have a clear idea of how they were going to respond to it. In retrospect, they did fine. We took a bunch of market share, but they kept all the money basically. So we being Google. So they survived it. They did a good job surviving the challenge. We have all the users now, but they have all the money. We have all the money, I guess now.

Lenny (00:31:07):
I want to spend more time on Google Docs and the story there. A couple questions. How long did it take from starting on it to feeling like it's working? Whatever you consider product market fit.

Sam Schillace (00:31:17):
Almost immediately, honestly. It was weird, the process of it was, I had this idea, we set this thing up, we started working together. We're like, "Ah, that's actually pretty..." So basically history is like I noticed contents editable, so the browser would do some editing for you. And then I noticed JavaScript, I never realized that JavaScript is out there. And we had done word processors in the past, this team, and for a long time. In fact, my co-founder, Steve, the other person on that document, wrote this thing called Full Write way back in 1987 or something like that, that was a direct competitor. '85 I think even, that was a direct competitor to Word one. 

(00:31:57):
So we knew word processors, and so we decided to just try it. What's it like to build a word processor? And the fact that you could collaborate on them was kind of an accident. They're just these things on the server. We hadn't built the thing that would lock somebody out yet. So there was just like, "Here's a document, you can edit these two things." Which we, A, immediately realized was really cool. We could both work in the same document at the same time. And then, B, realized, "Oh, crap, we're colliding with each other, because there's no presence or anything like that. And there's no collision detection or anything like that."

(00:32:26):
So pretty quickly we're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool. That feels good as a development team to have these shared documents, not to send stuff around and not... So that's cool. So let's build that out." But like, "Oh, bummer, collaboration's a problem. We'll have to go fix that." And naively figured out that that's a problem. And it took forever to get that working. It was really, really hard in the time, because we didn't do operational transform. I don't think that technique had been quite invented yet. And so we did three-way merge, which doesn't work that well, because the browsers... The logical document, a document can be rendered differently in HTML. There's not a canonical representation. 

(00:33:04):
And so you're doing merges where alphabetization can change, the order of attributes can change, the tree structure can change. Firefox would do a blank paragraph with a singleton BR tag, and IE would do it with an open closed paragraph tag. And so even the tree doesn't match. So it's a really hard merge problem. So that turned out to be a gnarly hard problem to solve. But once we had seen the value of working together, we were motivated to do that.

(00:33:32):
The interesting thing too with that is, I think if we'd gotten it in the other order, we might not have done it. It's another good example of why not and what if, right? Where we got really lucky that we saw the what if part, that we saw how cool a document in a browser that you could collaborate on would be, because if we understood how hard the collaboration piece would've been first without understanding that value, we might've been like, "Eh, it's not worth it. It's going to be so hard to solve that problem. It's probably not a useful app." So I think it's a good little counter example of that optimistic, pessimistic perspective we were talking about. We could easily have missed that idea, easily have missed that idea. And we just got lucky I think in the order it got presented to us.

Lenny (00:34:16):
That is really interesting actually, that you need to be pulled to the what if getting you so excited that you're going to spend however many years it took you to solve that problem, because you are so excited about this what if. I think that's a really good-

Sam Schillace (00:34:31):
Yeah, yeah, I mean I've spent a lot of time. It's kind of funny, I keep expecting people to just be like, "All right, grandpa, stop talking about G Docs. It's been a long time." Right? So it has been a long time. It's been 17 years, but it's still very relevant. It's got a couple billion users now I think, it's a big thing. But I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years just thinking about, why did that work? What worked about that? What lessons can I draw from it? There was a lot of energy around it, positive and negative. The first week I was at Google, an executive there refused to give me hardware, because he thought that Google was an app company not a... It was a search company, not an app company. And literally the guy in charge of hardware at the time refused to give me hardware for this service. And I had to threaten to either sue him or haul him in front of Eric Schmidt, because I had a contract and I had contracted earnouts.

(00:35:20):
So that was another one of these interesting lessons of sometimes the opposition is enormous. And if I had just been a random Google employee with this idea and no legal protection, and the CEO wasn't a fan of the project, it would've died. There's no way it would've made it through that negativity and that pessimism and that person being either challenged or afraid of the idea, or just not able to imagine it, or what. I'm not sure what. But we'll keep coming back to this idea of optimism, but I have this very strong feeling about that most of the reason people don't do really innovative good products is this kind of mindset. You're just not seeing the opportunities.

(00:36:02):
There's a lot of hard work for sure. There's a lot of stuff that you can read about and best practices of doing iteration and user testing and user interviews and really listening and all the engineering best practices. That stuff is pretty mechanical. Once you know where you're going, you can do that. It's not that hard to learn and to master it. I think the hard stuff is this mindset of being open in the right ways and understanding that some kinds of pushback are good pushback. Some are bad. 

(00:36:32):
I always think that product builders and entrepreneurs, you have this really hard problem of you have to be very rigid about your mission. I know where I'm going. I know what my mission is, and I'm going to go there because the world doesn't care, it's going to push back. But you also have to be really flexible about feedback. You're probably aren't going to be right about a bunch of it. And so you have to blend these two things together somehow. It's like a samurai sword that's hard on the back, but softer on the edge so it doesn't break. Or the other way around I think. But there's this hard thing you have to do as an entrepreneur, and I think it's the real core of building really great products is finding that balance and really listening to those signals, being open to it.

Lenny (00:37:16):
And also knowing how long to commit to it versus time to move on to something else. So along those lines, what was the moment where you finally felt product market fit for what became Google Docs, and how long was that from the beginning of starting to work on it?

Sam Schillace (00:37:30):
It depends on what market we're talking about. I've been continually surprised at the adoption of G Docs. I think we knew there was something there pretty quickly, probably in the first couple months. There was a lot of energy around it. It was a weird ride, because we built this thing on a whim, and as an experiment. We liked it. We decided to go just advertise on Google. At the time, 37signals was the cool company. And we're like, "That looks cool. We'll just be some engineers and we'll have a little subscription SaaS business thing and chill out. So let's see what it costs to acquire customers. So let's go advertise on Google and see how much it costs to get people to sort of show up, and then we'll figure out if we have a subscription business or not."

(00:38:12):
And that just got us noticed. That got us noticed by Google. It got us noticed. We were I think one of the first 10 articles at TechCrunch, like Michael Arrington. Another funny story is that I had a breakfast with Michael Arrington at Bucks, in that era where he was trying to decide, he had this spreadsheet idea he wanted to work on and he was trying to decide he should go do that and maybe join forces with us, because we were cool, or if he should continue to work on this blog thing he had gone called TechCrunch. So I might be partially responsible for TechCrunch, because we turned him down and said, "You should go do TechCrunch instead." Every time I would bump into him, I would laugh about that one. 

(00:38:50):
But when we got noticed, we really got noticed. There was just this period where we were the hot thing for a couple months, where every VC wanted to talk to us and everyone's trying to figure it out. Because I think we're like... When you see one point on the line, like Gmail, which came before us, you're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool. That's an interesting quasi-app." But it's like a weird kind of app. It's serialized. You can't really interact with it that much. And then you see this as another point on the curve and you're like, "Oh, that's a real app. Oh, crap. I wonder, is there anything stopping us from doing the rest of Office? Oh, probably not. How far is this going to go?"

(00:39:27):
And so I think we were that second point that showed that there was actually this totally different paradigm. And so we just got this enormous amount of tension pretty quickly. And then the rest of it was feeling our way through what does it actually mean? How much of the functionality do we need to build? What's the really important part about it? How much of its collaboration? We spent a bunch of energy on offline, which was miserable, which never turned out to matter that much. 

(00:39:51):
Now that team has spent a long time replicating all these features that we abandoned by the wayside, which I think I'm not that interested in. I think the future of documents looks very different than what we have now. I think it's kind of funny now that we're spending billions of dollars on GPUs to emulate wind pulp and ink pressed by metal type. We're building linear documents that are fixed, that are static. So one of the things we've been doing with these chatbot things is they also serve as documents. I say bots or docs all the time. And so you'll do these things where you... I do this all the time, where we'll interview... We'll create a new one. It has a separate identity, as a separate document, and then you tell it like, "I'm going to write a technical document. Here's roughly what it's about. Why don't you interview me?"

(00:40:35):
So it interviews you for an hour, and now you've got this nice linear artifact which you can read. It's very readable because it's conversational. But at the same time, you've been building all these semantically encoded virtual synthetic memories in the Spectre database. So you can come in and say, "Show me a diagram of this. Draw this diagram for me, change it in the following way. What is this? If I change this, what if I change that? Summarize this part of it." So you can start to interact with it. That's still creating stuff at the bottom of this linear artifact. But the next step that we're working on now is just making that dynamic where you just come to something and you talk to it and interact with it. 

(00:41:12):
I think one of the things that's going to happen is, just like it seems... Well, in the early days of G Docs, people would say, "Well, what if I'm not connected?" And one of the things I would say is, "In three or five years, if you get handed a device that's not connected to the internet, your word for it is going to be broken." Which is true, right? It's anachronistic and weird if something's not connected. I think we're going to feel the same way about intention and interactivity in our products very soon. If I can't tell something what my intent is and have it configure itself in an intelligent way, have it converse with me, whether that's a device or a piece of GUI UX somewhere, I think it's going to feel anachronistic. It's going to feel really weird. 

(00:41:55):
There's that scene in one of the early Star Trek movies where Scotty tries to talk to the mouse, right? He's like, "Computer make the..." He's pissed off because he can't talk to the computer. We're all going to be like that in five years I think, about it. And it's going to seem really weird that we have these applications that I can't collaborate with the application. Why can't I collaborate with the applications? It's like the application's locked on a file server just like the pre G Docs days. Why can't I just interact with it and have it configure itself the way I want it to configure itself, and show me the data the way I want to see this, and let me build the workflow the way I want it, and remember it for me and bring it back later, and all that stuff? So that was a long digression, but I would just like... You're asking about features and functionality, and I feel like where we are now with these feature wars, it's just silly. It's not the point at all. I think documents are going to change radically in the next few years.

Lenny (00:42:46):
I want to follow that thread. Before I do, I found the first TechCrunch post about you guys. Starts with, "Imagine Word, but as an Ajax browser application."

Sam Schillace (00:42:54):
Oh, yeah, there you go. Yeah. It wasn't even JavaScript. It was Ajax.

Lenny (00:42:58):
Ajax, so hot back then.

Sam Schillace (00:42:59):
It's also funny too, because I'll talk to young front end developers these days. I'm like, "I don't want to scare you too much, but jQuery didn't even exist when I wrote this thing. This is like bare metal in the DOM, and there were bugs." When I went to Google, I had to write this little network stack at the bottom of the JavaScript that in theory [inaudible 00:43:21] you could interrupt, you could have multiple requests inflate and you can interrupt them and discard them and stuff. 

(00:43:25):
But the stack at the time was really buggy, and I think it was IEE. And so I wrote this little network queue that would keep track of whether there were requests in flight, and kill them in a way that didn't break everything. And it was hard to do, because it's this weird asynchronous programming. And that piece of code, when I went to Google, they made me reformat it for the JavaScript readability standards, and I could not get it to work with their formatting. There was some bug in the JavaScript compiler of the time that whitespace mattered. And so I wound up checking it in broken, got the readability badge and immediately fixed it. It's like that was another one of our little hacks to get this working.

Lenny (00:44:06):

(00:44:58):
There's often this criticism as an engineer, you just want to work on interesting things and work on the technology before you find a problem that it's solving. It feels like with this example it was, you just think this is a cool technology, let's see what happens. Do you have any, I don't know, learnings or advice for when it's actually fine. Let's just play with this tech, be at the edges, you said, and maybe it'll lead somewhere, versus you should probably try to avoid that and first focus on a problem.

Sam Schillace (00:45:22):
I'm guilty of that. I mean, I like to play with stuff. I tend to think with my fingers as much as anything else. So I actually think there's a good place for just play with the tech a lot and figure out what it's good for. What I've evolved to doing these days with my teams is I pick what I call north stars that I think are interesting, useful things to get to rather than just messing around. What's a cool thing that I think might be buildable with this? 

(00:45:49):
So right now we're doing these multi-agent systems. We're trying to figure out how much independent work they can do without a person holding their hand. And so a nice domain to test that out in is programming, because you don't have a whole lot of... You just give something a Python environment and a file system and that's it and that's all it needs. And so you're not distracted by connectivity issues or whatever.

(00:46:11):
So one of the problems right now is go write the eye in Python. That's a problem I could give to an intern and it would take them a summer to do some halfway decent job of it. It's a thing you could expect a reasonably competent programmer to do, mostly independently. And so it should be possible for the system, if it's independent at all, to go do that. So is that useful by itself? No, because we already have the eye, it doesn't matter. But if we build a system of programming agents that can self-monitor and self-correct and bug themselves, that can build things that are roughly that scale of complexity, that's valuable. That would be a valuable thing to have. 

(00:46:43):
It's kind of interesting too, because that system already, it's produced a bunch of good insights. One of them is its kind of complicated and then hard to debug it. It's this asynchronous system of stochastic agents. That's a lot of stuff to deal with. So we wrote a debugger agent. And debugger agent watches stuff, and when there's a problem somewhere, it goes and figures out what the problem is and then gives you a nice explanation of what you broke and what needs to be fixed. And we haven't turned it loose on actually fixing things yet because we don't trust it, but it's very helpful as an assistant [inaudible 00:47:15]. We had one that documented itself too. That's the other one we did recently. Just turned it loose on documenting the code base and did a pretty good job of it.

(00:47:21):
So it's starting to produce interesting stuff, right? Because we have these north stars that we aim things at. And I think that's maybe a good antidote to this. Just playing with tech without being focused doesn't tend to produce anything that's super valuable. But picking these, even if they're arbitrary goals, as long as they're real goals that you're trying to get to, that's useful, right? Where you're like, "I wonder if I can get this to work. I wonder if I can build this thing." Then grind away at that for a week and see how close I can get. See what I learned about why it's hard. That's probably better than just like, "Let me poke at JavaScript for a while."

Lenny (00:47:59):
It's also different, I think, at a bigger company where you need to achieve something, versus I think as just an engineer out of college just playing around, like, go for it, right? It's just like, what's the worst that could happen?

Sam Schillace (00:48:09):
Even the early days of Writely, the very... I mean, we had a goal from the beginning. The beginning was like, "Can I write a word processor in a browser?" That was literally the problem statement, right? It was like, "I have content edible, I have Ajax or JavaScript. Can I put these together and something that feels like a word processor? Let's go do that." It's kind of half messing around with tech, but it's also half an actual goal. So I don't know. 

(00:48:35):
I like playing around with... I think a lot of the good product ideas, most of the good product ideas actually come up from engineering. So I think there's a lot to be said for, get familiar with tools, particularly weird esoteric combinations of tools can often be useful. If you understand or three things... At Google, I was one of only two people in the company who had the code readability, which is the right to check in code in this language, and both a backend language, which is the monitoring language, Org Mode, a middle tier language, which is Java, and a front language, which is JavaScript. No one else would do that full stack. I think it's useful to have that broad perspective sometimes.

Lenny (00:49:15):
Sam, the Renaissance man of all languages.

Sam Schillace (00:49:19):
Yeah, ADD more like it, but yeah, I pay attention to things.

Lenny (00:49:22):
I wanted to follow this thread a little further around being good at these what if questions. It feels like you've built this, or maybe you were born with this skill of thinking in the future, thinking about what's possible, thinking about where things are going. Is there anything that you could recommend to people listening to get better at the skill? Because for a lot of product people, this is really important to figure out, where could we be going and let's work back. 

Sam Schillace (00:49:45):
This is a really interesting question. And I may actually write, I've been thinking about writing a book from some of my Sunday letters, and this is maybe the frame of it. So I'm curious to see how flamed I get from saying this, it'll be interesting to see. I think there's this weird thing that I've noticed. I go talk to university kids and stuff like that, and there's this weird thing I noticed where when I was in university and I would talk to old guys like me, they would all say the PC is this stupid toy, whatever, it's not real computing, go on a mainframe or whatever. And my attitude was like, "Out of the way, old man, just like, you're irrelevant. I'm going to go do this thing. It's awesome." And go, go, go. 

(00:50:21):
And now when I talk to kids, I actually had a slide up at Michigan when I was talking recently that was titled, okay humor, and the professor actually put it up there. Because this generation is very pessimistic and doesn't seem to be quite as engaged and energetic about solving problems. And I've been puzzling through it. And I think maybe there's a bunch of different things that intersect.

(00:50:41):
I think one of them is, I think they all have to do with the willingness to take risk and to fail, honestly. I think that's really where it comes from. So I think you see a lot of filtered content. And that filtered content presents low probability events like five and six-sigma events as though they were normal. So you see everybody makes $100 million in their startup in the first three months. So if your startup isn't making $100 million, you're an idiot. There's that stuff. There's also, you're living out loud, so when you fail in that context it feels very painful. 

(00:51:12):
But I think there's also for elite students, like people at these elite schools, they're hard to get into. I went to Michigan, "You're kind of smart. Michigan's a good school. You live nearby, go apply to that one." Nothing serious about it, but kids in the elite schools, their lives are highly curated going up to getting into a school like that now, right? Those students like, "I didn't do sports, I didn't do extracurricular. I was just a weird nerd having to be good at math." And so I think there's that as well. If you're highly curated where you've spent a lot of your life thinking, "Everything I do has to have a reason and an output." It's very hard to just mess around and do something that might lead down a surprising path, right? So that's the curation is part of it. 

(00:51:55):
And then I think just in about the mid '80s when I graduated from high school, we stopped letting kids just play on their own, unsupervised outside with other kids. I grew up in this neighborhood full of, it was like the faculty ghetto for this small university my dad taught at, and we just ran wild. It was on the estate of widow of Dodge Motor, founder of Dodge Motor, so we had a couple hundred acres of swamp and fields to go run around in. We did hair-raisingly, dangerous things that my parents never knew about, and really explored and had fun. 

(00:52:27):
I think if you put all those pieces together, I think there's much less of an ability and willingness and skillset around experimenting to the point of failure, making a fool of yourself, having bad ideas. I send stupid emails to Satya at Microsoft all the time where I'm just like, "I don't know what the hell he thinks of me at this point." Because I send him all these goofy ideas. I think he actually gets it and he's like, he likes it, because I don't think people usually do that for him. But I'm just like, "Man, this is..." Then I'll send him an email a week later. I'm like, "Yeah, that was a dumb idea. Sorry about that. I've decided that wasn't a very good one."

(00:53:01):
But I think you cannot dance if you can't... If you're afraid to embarrass yourself. You cannot succeed if you're afraid to fail. That's just how it is. You have to have that sense of play. You have to have that sense of, it's okay if this doesn't work, I'll iterate on it. I have this personal motto, which is, from error comes virtue. Because I'm a maker, I make stuff. And I fuck it up all the time. I have poor motor skills, so I make mistakes constantly, and then I just figure out how to make the mistake into a virtue somehow. So I think it's a really good skill to have. The saying I took on this year and I really, really like it as my... I never had a personal motto before. I think it might be my personal motto, it's like, virtue from error.

Lenny (00:53:49):
Amazing. On this topic of failing. I think a lot of people hear this advice and they're like, "Yeah, okay, I need to fail more." It's hard to do. And oftentimes your performance at a company is negatively impacted. And it feels like for you it was just, you've done it enough times where fine, okay, it's going to be fine. I launch this thing, no one cares. I email Satya this thing, he ignores it or he doesn't. It's going to be okay. Is that maybe the key to this or is there anything else that you've done to allow you to be okay with failure?

Sam Schillace (00:54:19):
I feel like you can have a linear return on your effort if you manage things in a linear way, which is I think that tightly managing, okay, nothing's going to be surprising, I'm going to be within this boundary, I'm going to slowly accrete value, I'm going to play this game, whatever. I think you can have a nice linear, boring return to your career and you'll climb the ladder, it takes 30 years or whatever. I don't have the patience for that. And I think the way you get extraordinary returns is you do extraordinary things, right? You have to take bigger risks, and have more interesting shots to have this kind of extraordinary result in your career. 

(00:54:56):
I feel like I always tell people, I think... I mean, I pitch this because I've observed myself and thought about what has been successful in my career. It's not a thing everybody can do. I'm just kind of like this. I never really fully grew up. I'm kind of this weirdo. I still feel... I'm 57 now, and I feel like I'm about 17. I'm still very immature and like to mess around with stuff and play with things. So not everybody can do it. But I think there's, at the end of the day, the reason you get ahead in your career is you had a lot of impact. And the reason you had a lot of impact was because you picked something that you're good at that you did with a lot of intensity that wound up having impact, right? And so I think the good at part of it is hard too. We tend to undervalue the things we're good at. We tend to think work has to be unpleasant. And so if something is easy and fun, we don't tend to think it's very valuable.

(00:55:51):
So I think lots of people gravitate in this direction of, let's go do unpleasant things and grind our way through the career, because that's the way to make it. But the reality is, you should go do the thing that you feel guilty to get paid for, if there's a thing like that, and do the hell out of it, right? Do it as hard as you can. If you get pleasure from doing something that people want to pay you for, do it the best you can do it, as hard as you can do it. And if that's messing around and playing around with cool ideas, do the hell out of that. 

(00:56:19):
Work doesn't necessarily have to be hard. It often is, but it doesn't have to be. And the best case is that it isn't. The most impact you'll ever have is where you're in that mode where you're just in the flow and doing your thing and you're happy to do it and you can't quite believe they pay you and you don't understand how you're getting away with this, but it's super cool anyways, right? I think that's the career thing that makes sense to me. At least that's what I've done. Who knows? It's all luck sometimes, so it's hard to replicate these. Everybody has a different path.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. I love that advice. It's exactly where I was going to take our conversation, so I love that you took us there. It makes me think of, I'm reading Charlie Munger's Almanac, which just came out through Stripe Press. And Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's whole philosophy is, when you find an advantage, just go huge. Just go big, right? Make one bet a year. But when you find that, go for it. Don't buy a little bit at a time. And I love that. That's exactly what you're saying.

Sam Schillace (00:57:18):
Sometimes things don't make sense either. So I'll lean over and show you, for people with the video. That's an instrument I made. It's an instrument. So the top of that's a piece of redwood, this one right behind me with the cat eyes, the reason it's got these weird cat eyes, by the way, this is virtue from error right there, I dug this piece of wood out of the forest. It'd been sitting on the forest floor for 80 years trying to not rot and doing a pretty good job of it, because it's Redwood.

(00:57:43):
And there were knots in it. So those two cat eyes are where the knots were. There's another knot right here that I couldn't get out. But there's two knots in there that I had to carve out of there. That's a very weird design that I did by hand. It doesn't quite work. It's kind of a failure. The arch of it's a little bit too high, so it's a little hard to play, because the pick hits the top because the strings get a little bit close to the top. So like that... 

(00:58:02):
But that's an experiment. I was playing around. I wanted to do this thing. It was fun to do. It was a passion project. Now it's just hanging on the wall. Not everything works. Clearly I don't have a career as a luthier either. So it's more just a fun thing to do. But that's just a good example of the... I don't know. Sometimes I don't even understand why I do stuff. You just do it because you do it. Because it makes some sense to you.

Lenny (00:58:25):
Many people are in the opposite boat where they don't like what they're doing, they're miserable, but they have to have a job. They need income, they need to pay their rent, feed their family.

Sam Schillace (00:58:33):
I know, I realize what I'm saying is very privileged, and I am sorry about that. But from some perspective.

Lenny (00:58:38):
But I imagine you were also in those situations occasionally. Is there anything you recommend to folks that aren't in that, I would do this for free, I'm so excited about this work? Do you recommend try to get out that as soon as you can? Is it enjoy it as much as you can, get the most out of it?

Sam Schillace (00:58:53):
I mean, I've done plenty of things for money. I've done plenty of jobs to make money for my family, things I did not enjoy doing. All I can say is really, I stopped doing those things as soon as I could stop doing them. Not only as fast as I physically could, because I definitely had that Calvinist, oldest boy thing of, must provide, must suffer kind of thing. So it took me a long time to realize, no, actually I'm really creative. I don't have to be like everybody else. I can have my own path, and I can be this weird engineer. I always joke that I'm an engineer. Two is a prime number. It's just like I'm kind of a programmer, but not real... I'm this weird non-linear person that only barely fits into the programming world. But it's okay. It took me a long time to figure out that I could do that, that I could be comfortable with that part of myself. 

(00:59:40):
And I'm fortunate enough now that I've done enough things and have enough of a connection and network that people understand who I am and the value I can bring. And so I get away with doing that stuff that I like doing. So it is kind of privileged advice, and it's not something everybody can do at every stage in their career. Certainly earlier stages you often have to make compromises, but I still think it's worth paying attention to, right? When you're working, what makes you happy? What is the stuff that you feel guilty for getting away with? When I started managing people, I couldn't understand why people were paying me and I wasn't writing code, because all of my energy was attached to, "I can produce a lot of lines of code every day." And I asked my boss at the time, "Why are you so happy with this? I'm not writing anything." He's like, "I don't know what you're doing. Everywhere you go, it gets better. So just keep doing whatever it is you're doing."

(01:00:29):
And that was one of these moments where I was just like, "Oh, I could do something else and it's kind of fun. I like talking to people all day. That's great. They're going to pay me for talking to people all day. If they seem happy, I'm happy. Let me just lean into this for a while and see where it goes." So I think you just look for those moments when somebody is willing to let you do something that you feel happy to do, surprisingly happy to do, or doesn't feel like it's the thing you "should be doing". If you get those surprises like this, I think this goes back to this openness, the optimism that we were talking about. You have to be receptive and attentive to those moments when they show up. So I think they are in every career. If you listen for them, you'll see stuff show up where you don't think of it as who you are, but somebody else sees it in you and if you can be open to it, you can do these pivots.

Lenny (01:01:21):
When you talk about that, that makes me think of Seth Godin has this really important advice that's always stuck with me, that no matter what job you're in, just try to enjoy it and do the best version of that job you can, because you'll enjoy it more, that you'll end up being more successful, and it's just a good habit to just like, "I'm just going to do the best I can at being a waitress at this place. I'm just going to do the best at greeting people entering the Apple Store."

Sam Schillace (01:01:45):
Absolutely. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And even more than that, just find a way to bring yourself to it, right? What is the thing that you can do in this role that is unique to you that you're the most comfortable with, right, where you really have high impact. I don't know. I tend to be very, it's kind of a joke because I'm a programmer, I tend to be a very binary person, right? I'm either all in or all out on something. So whenever I do something, I do it with just a ridiculous amount of intensity, for better or for worse. So I find the ways to do stuff. I tend to be very unhappy if I can't be intense in something successfully, and then if I can be intense in it successfully, I'm happier and the people around me are probably less happy, but stuff happens. Anyways, I get things done.

Lenny (01:02:35):
Speaking of getting things done and being intense and working things that are really interesting, you're responsible for some of the cutting-edge work happening at Microsoft in AI. You're spending a lot of time in AI. I'm curious to get your take on just what you find interesting, where you think things are going, what people should know about AI. I'll share a couple of quotes that you put out somewhere that I have here that I think are cool. One is, "AI isn't a feature of your product. Your product is a feature of AI."

Sam Schillace (01:03:01):
I love that one. Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:03):
Another is, "It'll be possible to add some value by building AI into your product, but really transformative massive value will come from building apps and solutions that won't work at all without it, that treat it as a true platform."

Sam Schillace (01:03:14):
Yeah, I think both of those are really true. So what I'm working on is, most of the industry right now is focused on, when you talk about somebody who's working in AI, it's somebody who's creating models, right? It's somebody who's figuring out how to do some new open source model or somebody who's doing some new training or make some model bigger. And I think that's very, it's valid, useful work. It's just not the kind of work I like to do very much. And a lot of people are doing it. 

(01:03:38):
And so I'm an app builder, I'm a tool builder, and so I don't create models, I consume them, right? I want to build things around them. And so when I started with Microsoft, started working on GPT-4 with Microsoft in September of last year, my immediate reaction to it after picking my jaw up off the floor, which we were all doing in the early days, was, "Okay, this is cool, but in some computer science sense, it's just this function, this stochastic pure function that just takes a character array and rearranges it and hands it back to you. That's not much of a building block for building programs. We need state and we need control flow, and orchestration, and call-outs." 

(01:04:19):
So that just started me down this rabbit hole of thinking about building the Semantic Kernel, which we built, and then building Infinite Chatbot, which was next, and these other projects we've been working on. And the more I think about this stuff, the more I do think those two quotes are good quotes. I think what's going to happen over time... I actually think we're at the beginning of this just gigantic disruption in the software industry. I think the way that the internet made distribution of information free, I think AI is going to make pixels free. 

(01:04:49):
So pixels are expensive to produce now, they take programmers and they take lots of infrastructure, and putting a pixel in front of the user is a hard thing to do and lots of software is predicated on that. Lots of business is. The way lots of businesses were predicated on it being hard to distribute information 25 years ago. But you can see this already with things like just images, right? Two years ago, if you wanted a piece of digital art, you had to go invent Photoshop, learn to use Photoshop, use Photoshop to do the drawing, build the skills up. That's a lot of work to produce those pixels. Now it's like, I want a picture of a cat riding a bike eating a banana, done, right? So those pixels got really free. 

(01:05:28):
And the similar things are happening in the business world as well, and I think it's just going to start to happen everywhere. So you can draw... This is what if, let's go ask some what ifs. So what if the models get really good at planning, so they get more independent, they can do longer and complicated things? What if the multimodal stuff gets really good so that they can both consume and produce dynamic UI like I was talking about? What if we figure out a good way to store state, this is my bots or docs thing. So what if do we figure out a good way for you to really highly personalize something so it knows you really well and you trust it with confidential information? 

(01:05:59):
If you have all of those things, you're just going to spend a lot of time talking to that agent. It's like, what would you do... If you imagine you're the richest person in the world, you've got 100 of the best people working for you, and a chief of staff, and they're tireless, and they never fight with each other, they do everything you want. With that staff supporting you, what are you doing with software? What are you doing when you're sitting in front of a screen? Well, you're probably communicating intention and you're probably consuming some either entertainment or some of the products of that intent. And that's about it. You're not messing around with pokey static apps and stuff. That doesn't work, right? You're just telling your staff to deal with stuff for you. 

(01:06:36):
So I think that's where we're headed, I think, in the world of software at least. Things are going to get more dynamic, more intentional, more semantic, more fluid, then more personalized. I think there's a ton of problems to be solved to make that vision real. But I think this feels to me a little bit like seeing the Palm maybe, or the early iPhone, where you're just like, "Okay, I get it. Phones are going to get interesting. That's a new device. Now we got to go do a whole bunch of engineering before they actually are as useful as they're today." Right?

(01:07:09):
So I get it. I think software is going to change radically now. I had the same feeling when we started doing... This is going back to G Docs again. It's another lesson. It's another one of these category shifts. The second we got Writely up on its feet and I was like, "Ah, the browser is actually a platform that you can actually build real apps in. I get it, the world's going to change." And we had a ton of stuff to do, right? Nobody really understood distributed systems. Nobody understood how to build stuff in multiple places at once or how you deal with replication, how you deal with security, all kinds of hard... All the development patterns had to shift from Waterfall, to Agile, to CI-CD, all this stuff had to change to fully realize that world.

(01:07:51):
But I remember back in 2005, this very quick... And the people who were the strong proponents, I think all saw this, instantly saw that the world had changed and there was this new category. And I have exactly the same feeling about generative AI. Like, yep, software's going to totally change. These businesses are going to totally change. It might take 10 years to really work through all of it, but yep, door open, new room, new game, start coloring in the blanks, right? Let's go.

(01:08:19):
So that's where I think we're going. And that sounded really certain, it probably sounded more certain than I should sound. I think there's a lot of, probably a quarter at least, if not a half of what I just said is wrong in some way. So we're going to learn a bunch of stuff along the way. And there's a lot of work to do, a whole lot of work to do and a whole lot of unanticipated side effects are going to pop out, and there's just a whole lot of stuff to get that to be real the way there was with all of the last transformations. But I think this is just a giant category shift. I think it's just incontrovertible that it is. 

(01:08:55):
It's kind of funny when Gemini came out, all the press take was like, "Oh, it's not that different from GPT-4. I guess we're done with AI now, we can go back to bed." I'm like, "That is the dumbest possible interpretation of that story that you could come up with I think." Of all the takes you could have had on that, I think that was the dumbest one honestly. It could say many things about either company. It could say many things about the science. But, "Guess there's nothing here to see." Is not one of them.

Lenny (01:09:28):
For somebody listening that wants to not fall behind on this and or find opportunity for their product, other than just playing with it, which is what everyone is always saying, just like, "Play with it. Use ChatGPT, use Bard, and all these things." Is there any advice you'd give listeners for how to approach thinking about AI, how it integrates into the stuff they're doing?

Sam Schillace (01:09:48):
Yeah, I agree with you. Just play with it, is not really great advice. I think the best technique I've really seen for learning things is to pick a thing to do with the thing you're trying to learn, right? Even if it's an unreasonable... Even if it's a goofy, weird thing, right? Like I'm going to figure out how to draw funny pictures with this programming language or whatever. Even if it's a dumb thing like that, picking some arbitrary goal and being a little bit stubborn about trying to get yourself to it is a good way to learn stuff.

(01:10:17):
And then the question is, "What goals are you picking?" So try to pick goals that lead somewhere maybe at least a little bit interesting. So if your goal is just like, "I'm going to mess around with ChatGP for an hour." That's not really much of a goal. If it's like, "I'm going to go try to GPT that can do this part of my job, let's see how close I can get." That's more interesting, right?

(01:10:41):
And I do think unfortunately, one of the other ways in which this is very reminiscent of the early dot com era, and I think plenty of people have said this, is this sense of exhaustion in keeping up. There's so much stuff going on right now. And that's I think another good strong indicator that something really big is going on, where it's just very, very difficult to keep track of all the stuff that's happening. It's kind of interesting, because I remember, just to kick crypto's corpse one last time, there was a tweet at the beginning of the year that I saw that somebody was like, "Yeah, it took the AI bros a week to come up with as many use cases as crypto came up with in a decade." Which definitely feels true, right? It's just so much stuff going on. And I think you just have to try to keep track of it. 

(01:11:29):
One of the other things I think is going on in the moment, which feels a lot like the cloud moment to me, is it's hard to get the first idea. The zero to one is hard. Understanding that there's something there at all is the really hard part, because you have to be lucky and you have to be talented and you have to look in the right place and do some very hard work. But once you understand that there's something there, like the cloud model works, or their generative AI matters and scale works and stuff like that. Once you're there, the one to many, all the optimization stuff, that happens in parallel, it happens really quickly. Many, many, many people can do it. There's a lot of energy. It'll just go really fast. 

(01:12:05):
So I think we're in that phase where just like we're in the elaboration phase where we understand this step and people are just filling in all the white space as fast as they can. So that'll slow down eventually, hopefully. We'll see what the next year brings. But yeah, it's a hard time. It's hard for professionals even. I think you just have to read a lot. You have to think a lot. You have to play with stuff. You have to choose your battles. You have to pick good targets. Pick a goal in your domain that would matter to you if you can get to it, and then go try to solve that problem with some specific technology and get to know that technology.

(01:12:39):
Maybe pick the technology based on how popular it seems, if you want to learn something lots of people [inaudible 01:12:44]. Those are all good. I think you just have these kind of mundane... I don't think it's really a secret, I don't think. They're kind of mundane strategies, but you just have to pick some stuff and do some homework. And there's no magic single bullet to learning this stuff. You just have to run. It's like, "How do I run this sprint without getting out of breath?" You don't. You're going to be out of breath, run hard. It's just what it is.

Lenny (01:13:09):
I love that advice. And I love it connects to everything else that you've been talking about is, find some problem someone has, find some value you could provide, and then think about, how can AI potentially provide that? I think that's really practical. Great advice. Maybe a last question just around Microsoft. It feels like Microsoft is firing on all cylinders. It feels like it's become one of the most innovative companies out there. It feels like Satya is known now as the most innovative, best executing CEO out there potentially. That's just what it feels like. Being on the inside, I'm just curious, what is it that you think Microsoft is doing so right or how they think that enables them to be so innovative and continue to be such a behemoth as so much has changed in tech?

Sam Schillace (01:13:52):
There's a couple of things. First of all, I think very, very highly of Satya, or I wouldn't be there. I really, really like Satya. He is very much what he appears to be from the outside. I've had plenty of candid private conversations with him and watched him in meetings and stuff like that. He's a very decent, genuine, honest, high energy, caring individual with a ton of empathy. He's really motivational in a way that is not destructive. He believes very strongly that a leader's job is to raise the energy of the organization and he really lives that. And I watch him in meetings where I'm a domain expert and I cannot believe how engaged he is in stuff and how much he understands about something that I know he's not as deep an expert as some of the people in the room are and he's fully in there. So he is a really incredible leader in many ways. That's one thing. 

(01:14:44):
I think another is that culture is very humble, honestly. I mean, it's interesting going from Google to Microsoft. And I don't want to draw comparisons or anything like that, but I think there are definitely similarities and differences between the companies. And I think one thing that stands out with Microsoft is it's a humble culture. It does unglamorous work all the time to make businesses be successful. So it's got that sort of mindset of just hard work and humility, which I value a lot. And then I think there's just, I mean honestly, there's just a fantastic number of really talented people working there. 

(01:15:18):
It's kind of funny, this year I've been writing a lot of patents, because there's just a lot of stuff going on in the world. And I've written more patents this year by a lot than the rest of my career combined. And I commented on the number. I'm like, "I've written 15 patents this year." I commented to the patent attorney that I work with. He's like, "Ah, that's nothing. The chief science officer wrote 700 of them one year during the mobile boom." It's like, whatever you feel about patents, and I don't necessarily love patents, although it's part of my job to write them, but that's the kind of people that are there, these just fantastically talented people with just really deep experience at a lot of different levels. 

(01:15:58):
I think that's part of it too. There's just a lot of really good folks there. Kevin Scott, who I work for, is one of the smartest... He's probably the smartest person I've ever been fortunate to work directly with. He's definitely one of the smartest I've ever met. He's pretty fantastic. And the group around him is pretty fantastic, and the leadership in Windows and Office is pretty fantastic. So it's just a lot of good people and a lot of good attitude, and a good leader I think is the answer. And luck. It's always luck too, right? Kevin and Satya made a bet on OpenAI a few years back, and they're doing some extraordinary things with capital raise and the support of that technology and stuff like that. That doesn't happen by accident either.

Lenny (01:16:39):
No drama there, by the way.

Sam Schillace (01:16:41):
I wouldn't know anything [inaudible 01:16:42] there. I hear it's calm. I stay far away from it as possible, honestly. 

Lenny (01:16:47):
Most under-the-radar startup out there. Amazing. Sam, is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Sam Schillace (01:16:58):
Mostly I think probably take all of this as more my personal opinions and not Microsoft's official stands. This is just me being an engineer. I'm not here as a Microsoft representative necessarily. But yeah, I don't know. Build stuff, solve problems, build stuff. That's what it is, right? That Jobs quote-

Lenny (01:17:21):
Fuck around. 

Sam Schillace (01:17:21):
Fuck around. Well, that Jobs quote is right. The world was built by people just like you. That's that's the thing. It's really true. You don't have to have permission, you just have to have energy.

Lenny (01:17:33):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Sam Schillace (01:17:36):
Probably not.

Lenny (01:17:38):
Great answer. Sam. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Sam Schillace (01:17:44):
I like weird book. There's this book called Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, which is this very beautiful meditation on the nature of cities and the nature of Venice. And I read it the first time I was in Italy right after college, and it just blew all the circuits in my brain when I went to Venice, and so that was pretty cool. The other one I recommend to people with some caution is this very intense and disturbing book called The Wasp Factory by Ian Banks, which is probably the creepiest and hardest book I've ever read, but it's a very interesting psychological deep dive. So those are both fiction. If you're looking for business advice, I think the business advice one is probably, Where Good Ideas Come From, Steven Johnson. I really like that book. I think some of the stuff about the adjacent possible. I think it's an old book now, but I think it's pretty timely still. I think he had some good stuff in there.

Lenny (01:18:36):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Sam Schillace (01:18:40):
My favorite one right now, my guilty pleasure is watching Gary Oldman be a completely disgusting over-the-hill British spy in Slow Horses, which is pretty fun. And I'm actually having a little fun with the retro monster stuff like Monarch and stuff like that. It's kind of fun to watch. I don't know. I have absolute junk food taste when it comes to media.

Lenny (01:19:04):
Love creepy monsters and bugs.

Sam Schillace (01:19:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:07):
I love it. 

Sam Schillace (01:19:07):
Shooty science things that blow up a lot. I'm not very deep.

Lenny (01:19:13):
By the way, have you seen Scavengers Reign, Scavenger Reigns, Scavenger Reign? Okay. You'd love it. It's on HBO. It's incredible. It's an animated sci-fi thing, and it's very creepy, slimy, kind of alieny things, and it's so beautiful. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Sam Schillace (01:19:32):
I have one that got banned at Google, and I liked it. I still think it's a fun question. It's, how many zeros are at the end of 100 factorial? And the reason I like it... Yeah, it's like, you made the face, right?

Lenny (01:19:43):
Going to ask ChatGPT for this answer.

Sam Schillace (01:19:45):
Well, here's the thing. Well, don't though, because the reason I ask it is, it seems like an unreasonable and impossible answer. And if you sit down and think about it a little bit, I'm not going to tell you how to reason through it, but you can figure out the answer to it in a few minutes. And so the reason I ask is not to get to the answer. It's because I just want to see how people react when I give them something that seems impossible and unreasonable. 

(01:20:07):
And some people just back off and refuse to engage with it. And some people are just like, "I don't know, let me roll my sleeves up and see how far I can get in this thing." And if you do that, you can actually get through it. And I just think it's interesting, because that's building stuff, right? That's a good signal of when somebody tells you you can't write a word processor in the browser and you can't do collaboration. Do you roll your sleeves up and deal with it or do you fall over?

Lenny (01:20:32):
And what was the question again? Just to [inaudible 01:20:34]. 

Sam Schillace (01:20:33):
How many zeros are at the end of 100 factorial in decimal?

Lenny (01:20:39):
And then why did it get banned?

Sam Schillace (01:20:41):
I think it got known, and somewhere... Actually, the funny thing is, one of their more senior directors, actually he's a SVP now I think, Dave [Bezeras 01:20:51], I interviewed him when he came in, and I asked him that question. And his response was, "I don't do math. Next question." And so I failed him. I was the veto. And they have this policy where... We're friends now. They have this policy where one veto is actually a good signal. If you're controversial as a candidate, they would take a hard look at you. And so my veto may have gotten him higher, because I was like, "I don't know, he wouldn't answer this question. That's a red flag for me, so don't hire him." And he turned out to be a great person. So it's maybe not a good question anyways. 

Lenny (01:21:20):
That comes back to one of your other lessons of the best ideas have some people that are just very anti that idea. 

Sam Schillace (01:21:26):
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

Lenny (01:21:27):
It all circles back. Next question, what is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Sam Schillace (01:21:34):
My father-in-law and my brother-in-law worked for the American car companies. And I've never had American cars. I just drive Japanese cars, because I grew up in Detroit and just hated that culture. And so recently we bought a Ford Mustang Mach-E, the electric Ford Mustang, and I just love the shit out of that car. I don't know why. It's just a really fun car to drive. It's very surprising to have this American muscle car that I'm just really... An electric American muscle car that I really like. So that's probably the current product I really am enjoying the most right now.

Lenny (01:22:03):
Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, find useful share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Sam Schillace (01:22:11):
Virtue from error. Yeah, I think that's... It's become one for me, and the more I say it, the more I like it. But I just like this idea of, you're going to fuck up, make something from it and be creative with your mistakes. I like that a lot. So I think that's at least my current one.

Lenny (01:22:33):
And say it again, just so people get it.

Sam Schillace (01:22:35):
There's lots of different ways to say it, but I just like, virtue from error, is probably the cleanest way to say it, or from error, virtue.

Lenny (01:22:42):
Final question. Apparently you're the only person who has sold both a company to Google... I like that you already know where I'm going. Both a company and also 200 pounds of blood sauce.

Sam Schillace (01:22:53):
Yes.

Lenny (01:22:54):
Both to Google. Tell us the story.

Sam Schillace (01:22:56):
The story? So I have a friend who dropped out of the tech industry to start a company up in San Francisco called Boccalone, which was an artisan salumi thing in the Ferry Building. And so he'd make blood sausage and stuff. So there was this wonderful insane chef back in the day when Google had really high-end cuisine in the campuses, probably like 2005 or something, or no, sorry, probably 2008, something like that. And so my friend Mark shows up. This Chef JC had the word foie gras tattooed onto his knuckles. So that's the kind of guy he was, he was just super awesome. 

(01:23:30):
And so I had Mark show up to talk to JC about buying some of those products, because I was an investor in that company. And he showed up with a bag of blood sausage that was, he's like, "Here, you should take this one and put it in the refrigerator." And like, "Why?" He's like, "It's dripping." I'm like, "It's all right. It's fine." He's like, "It's dripping blood." Because they hadn't got the packaging right. So we showed the blood sausage to JC. He cooked some of it up. It was really good, and he was like, "Yeah, that's awesome. I'll buy a couple hundred pounds of it." And so technically, because I was an investor in that company, I sold both the company Writely and 200 pounds of blood sausage to Google, which I think is a unique accomplishment. And I would just absolutely love to meet anybody who has also done that. We'll have a party.

Lenny (01:24:13):
Did you get stock though, for that blood sausage?

Sam Schillace (01:24:16):
No, I did not get stock or anything. That guy was crazy, at one point... Just a quick JC story. At one point Google rented some goats to graze the hillside across the way. And JC was a very non-politically correct, non-woke kind of guy, and he did not like all the sort of attitude at Google. So when these goats were across the hill, he bought a goat carcass from somewhere else and roasted it over a spit and carried it whole through the line for lunch one day to serve up, just to completely tweak people. So that was a different time at Google.

Lenny (01:24:51):
The good old days. 

Sam Schillace (01:24:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:24:53):
Amazing. Sam, that's it. We did it. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to potentially follow up on any of this? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Sam Schillace (01:25:02):
Well, I have a Substack, which is Sunday Letters From Sam, that I write a letter roughly every Sunday, that I've been doing for about 10 years. Not that particular... Well, I've been writing letters to my engineering team on Sunday since I was the head of engineering at Box, and I think that's 12 years now or something. I just started doing it to keep myself accountable, and people liked it, so I just kept doing it. So now I do it in public. I repost them on LinkedIn. You can find me there. You can message me on LinkedIn if you want to. I'm hesitant to give out my personal email address, because this is probably going out to a lot of people and I don't want to get spammed. 

Lenny (01:25:37):
Smart, smart man. 

Sam Schillace (01:25:38):
Last funny story. At Google, my email address at Google got leaked somehow and a spammer... I was a little but notorious during the early days of Writely, and so a spammer used it for what's known as a Joe job, where you send something out, fake emails out, with somebody else's email address as the reply to. So several hundred million emails went out, and all bounced. And so for a while I had my own Gmail front end server that would filter them out for a couple of weeks until that died down.

Lenny (01:26:08):
Let's make sure no one does that to you right now.

Sam Schillace (01:26:10):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny (01:26:12):
You didn't answer the final question. How can listeners be useful to you other than not doing that, spamming things to you? 

Sam Schillace (01:26:17):
Oh, I guess, the thing I guess I'm interested in is people making interesting progress in the direction of that product vision that I talked about. Independent action, the UI part of this stuff, generating UI, consuming UI, all that stuff, I think I'm curious about that. I mean, and interesting ideas. Anything surprising that seems that you'd like to have somebody pay attention to. I entertain weird ideas all the time. I do my best to entertain weird ideas and live what I preach. So if you think you have something that's really resonating that you think you want to have somebody pay attention to, you can connect me. I'll take a look at it, I'll do my best. I won't look at stuff that's incremental and boring. It has to be actually interesting and disruptive. So I don't care. I'm not going to review the 27th memo writing AI chatbot thing that plugs into Outlook or whatever. I don't care.

Lenny (01:27:11):
I think that's a final good takeaway, is that's a litmus test for, are you working in something innovative? Which I think has been a great theme of this conversation. 

Sam Schillace (01:27:18):
Yes. Tell me something that'll piss me off. That'd be more...

Lenny (01:27:21):
Sam, thank you so much for being here.

# Why Uber’s CPO delivers food on weekends | Sachin Kansal

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:02):
I feel incredibly lucky to have gotten to work with Sanchan while I was at Airbnb. He joined Airbnb as a director of product and quickly moved up the ranks to head of product for all of Airbnb. Before Airbnb, he spent almost four years at Instagram as head of product for Instagram Ads, and then he created and led the Instagram Shopping product and team.

(00:00:21):
Before that he was director of product at Yahoo and a PM at Microsoft. And today he's the VP of product at Coinbase. I don't think I've worked with a harder working PM, particularly someone who's incredibly kind and nice and generous.

(00:00:34):
In my conversation with Sanchan, we cover what he's learned from working with some of today's best CEOs, including Brian Chesky, Brian Armstrong, Zuck and Kevin Systrom, what it was like inside Airbnb when COVID hit and how they made it through travel completely stopping, how to set up your product development process at a startup, tips for hiring amazing product managers, when to hire your first PM, when to A/B test and when not to, and so much more.

(00:00:59):
I hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did. So many product managers are basically treated like project managers. You get higher thinking that you'll be deep in product strategy and vision, and getting to know your customers, only to wind up organizing other people's work and finding backlogs and optimizing tiny, tiny features.

(00:01:21):
If this sounds familiar, you need Dovetail. Because Dovetail gets that the true heart of product management is understanding what customers want, why they want it and how to give it to them. That's why Dovetail built a suite of user research products that help you get to the core of what your customers really want and why they want it.

(00:01:38):
Dovetail offers a suite of powerful analysis tools to help you identify themes, patterns and insights in your customer interviews, allowing you to make better, data informed decisions about what solutions you should build next. Organizations all over the world, like Atlassian, Canva, Datadog, GitLab, Sketch, Nielsen Norman Group, and Deloitte use Dovetail to get a better understanding of their customers and build better products.

(00:02:04):

You can also enrich that information to automatically see if the person exists on various watch lists. Just go to Withpersona.com/lenny to get started. Sanchan, welcome. Thank you so much for being here.

Sanchan Saxena (00:03:26):
Thank you, Lenny, for inviting me. Excited to be here and chat with you today.

Lenny (00:03:29):
Absolutely. My pleasure. I was really lucky to work with you at Airbnb for many years, where you were a beloved product leader. And then you went on to do bigger and better things now at Coinbase. And I'd love to just hear how you first got into product, and then just a little bit of your journey of how you got to where you're today, where you're basically head of product at Coinbase.

Sanchan Saxena (00:03:49):
Yeah, happy to answer. Maybe I'll go back in time and start from my first job. I was in my third year of engineering where the entrepreneurial bug caught me, so to say, bit me. And I took a little bit of sabbatical from my engineering, which by the way, was in aerospace engineering.

(00:04:03):
I wanted to be an astronaut, go to space. Unfortunately back then, there wasn't an Elon Musk for SpaceX. If you wanted to go to space, you got to work for a government agency, which I didn't like. Fast forward that to my third year of engineering and I start my company, raised a bunch of money, hired some people.

(00:04:18):
Didn't go as planned, so I [inaudible 00:04:20], came back and finished my engineering and got a job at Microsoft, which made my mom very happy. My mom said, "My son finally has a stable job. What the heck he was doing running some companies?" But jokes aside, I got a job at Microsoft, which was a great starting position.

(00:04:34):
I started in engineering. But within a year or so, I moved into product. And I moved to the Silicon Valley office of Microsoft. Never worked in Seattle, but always worked in Silicon Valley at Mountain View. And I worked for this product called Hotmail. I don't know how many people know this or not, but there's an email service called Hotmail. I was one of the product people.

Lenny (00:04:50):
Absolutely. It's scary that people may not even know what Hotmail is at this point.

Sanchan Saxena (00:04:55):
Right? It's kind of crazy. Back in the day, it was pretty cool. I worked there, and then since then have been in Silicon Valley. So moved into product back in, I think, 2005 or '06, something like that, and since then been in product. I've been very lucky and fortunate to have stumbled upon incredible opportunities all the way from Facebook and Instagram to Airbnb and Coinbase.

(00:05:16):
And fun fact, when I joined Instagram, it was still very small. And it was less than, I think, 50 engineers or something like that. Very tiny. It was pre-revenue. We made $0 in revenue. I still remember the day when Zuck told Kevin Systrom we got to go make revenue, and we made $0 back then.

(00:05:30):
And was there till 2017. By the time it was like a billion monthly active users, multiple billion dollars in revenue, was my first hypergrowth experience as a product leader. And then in 2017, I joined Airbnb, which is where you and I worked together. There I had a dual role.

(00:05:45):
I was a GM of Airbnb Plus, but also the head of product helping Brian Chesky scale the product management organization, establish the culture of it, and see how best we can build a world class part organization. And then after that, I took some time off, about six months, introspective to see what do I want to do next.

(00:06:00):
And that is when I went into the Web 3.0 rabbit home, and that's when I learned more and more about Web 3.0, what's happening over there. I've always been investor in crypto since 2014, but never thought of it as a builder. I was like, "Ah, I don't know if I want to build in there. It seems cool. I can participate from the outside."

(00:06:18):
But then the more I read, the more I realized, "Man, this is one of the biggest revolutions happening." And that's when I joined Coinbase and here I'm the VP product for ecosystems and a bunch of other stuff that I do here, and excited to be able to play a small role in this next revolution called Web 3.0.

Lenny (00:06:31):
Amazing. Just listening into that trajectory and places that you worked, I imagine people are wondering like, "Man, how do I follow a trajectory like that? How do I live a life like Sanchan?" Do you have any advice for someone that's maybe just starting out that may be wondering like, "How do I follow this sort of path? How do I work at all these incredible companies and get to maybe where you are now?"?

Sanchan Saxena (00:06:51):
Yeah, I look back at my career, one thing that is very true is that I never had that plan. I stumbled upon a lot of things. I mean, I wanted to be an aerospace engineer, didn't work out, pivoted. I started my own company, didn't work out, pivoted. I came to Silicon Valley, worked at Hotmail, didn't work out, pivoted.

(00:07:07):
Things start to materialize when you actually take steps to do something. My biggest advice to people is, oftentimes the analysis paralysis of dotting every eye, crossing every tee sometimes chokes you out of opportunities. When you find something that gives you energy, just jump in with both feet. And try to go through that process, and pivot and learn, and pivot and learn and pivot.

(00:07:29):
That's how you would create a great career as opposed to sort of a five year career plan and working backwards from that. Those things just don't work. The other thing I would say is I read this book early on in my life called the Little Bets. It actually was a reflection of whatever I did in my life. Before that I thought I was a weirdo, I don't know what I'm doing. And then I read that book and I realized, "Oh my God, there's some method to my madness. It's called little bets."

(00:07:52):
You take little bets, you try them out. If they don't work out, you build rapid recovery and start to do something else. And that is the meta story connecting all the dots in my life, in all the career opportunities that I've had, just one piece of big advice I'll tell everybody. The second thing I'll say is product management is a very interesting discipline.

(00:08:10):
You don't go to school for that. You don't get a degree for that. And most people that I know in product have stumbled upon product management. They were doing something else and like, "Oh my God, this seems cool. I want to do this." The advice I give early stage product people is you got to learn the art and the science of product management early on in your career.

(00:08:29):
There's an art piece to it and then there's a science piece to it, and you got to be able to manage both of those things in your head. If you become too scientific, you miss out on opportunities because you can't see those opportunities using the scientific method of discovery, because they're too tiny or they're so farfetched that people cannot even understand them.

(00:08:45):
And the art piece is really important for you to be able to sniff those out by being in the community, hanging out with people who are actually builders and learning where the next trends would be. My advice to people is go get a job which will make you the fastest learner in the field of product management.

(00:09:00):
That is what will help you a lot. No course, no degree, none of those things will help. The most important thing will be how quickly can you jump in, learn the auto product management. Some people prefer doing that at a startup. Some people prefer doing it at a established fan company, which has processes and systems as well. It's your choice. But the fastest you learn that, the better it'll get for you.

Lenny (00:09:20):
Wow. I love so much about that advice. To go a little bit further on this last point. When people are looking for a company to go join to learn, to accelerate their career the way you're describing, what do you think they should be looking for? I know you said maybe a startup. Do you think they should join a startup? Do you think they should join a bigger company? What kind of things should you look for to find the best place to learn?

Sanchan Saxena (00:09:41):
Yeah, I think there is no right recipe for one, but it matters to the individual. I'll share both stories with you. The way to think about this is let's say you want to get to a destination, whichever destination it is, you probably want to get on the faster ship. You don't want to get on a slower ship. That's one metaphor to use in your mind.

(00:09:58):
And then when you got to the ship, you know the ship will get there, but remember you are not going to get to your destination faster than the ship will. You got to understand what your destination is, then optimize the learnings from there. At a startup, you're going to learn a lot of things. There are three types of learning, a starter learning, meaning you can get started. You're a person who can get started. You see an idea, you see an opportunity, you can get started. Right?

(00:10:21):
That is something that a startup will teach you a lot. You see something, you want to get started to do something about it, great, you'll learn a lot over it. And there's zero to one people who can then take what they have started and scale it to one. And then there are one and beyond people who are scalers, who will scale the system that is found product market fit.

(00:10:38):
And I think depending on your journey, depending on your career, depending upon where you are, you might want to optimize for different types of learnings as well. What I advise people is there's a great way to go to Google, Facebook and Amazon and learn the scale mechanisms that these companies have built. And I look at Amazon and I get inspired by that company, because what they have figured out is how to scale innovation with 1 million employees.

(00:10:59):
It's a pretty different learning. And you can't potentially find that at a startup. Similarly, the ability to just get started, the ability to see an idea, start hacking at it, start building it without the encumbrances of the processes and the system that these big organizations have, you can probably learn that in a big company as well. You got to figure out what are you optimizing for, what goes well with you.

(00:11:23):
I've seen many successful leaders who will get choked up in a big company environment, and I've seen many big company successful executives who want to choke up in a very startup environment. And this is not for everybody. Both sides of the games are not for everybody. First and foremost recognizing what gives you energy, recognizing where you thrive the most is really important.

(00:11:41):
For example, I am not the guy who can optimize a 100,000 employee company. I will never enjoy that kind of learning. I've done to some extent a large company thing, but I thrive in that starter to scale angle. But when it becomes too large, I start to lose interest in that kind of learning. Some people enjoy different things. You got to understand what it is and be able to optimize there.

Lenny (00:12:03):
Where would you say you learned the most of all the companies you worked at that helped accelerate your career most?

Sanchan Saxena (00:12:09):
I think I would rank Airbnb probably the place that I learned the most. And I'll share with you and your audience why I feel that way. I joined Airbnb back in 2017, making decent revenue, had good product market fit. I remember when I got there, the entire product management order was like 30 people or 40 people, something like that.

(00:12:26):
You had three directors of product, very small still for a company that was generating a billion plus dollars in revenue. And then the context was there was this ambitious founder, Brian, who will never take no for an answer. And he would bend reality in many regards to make shit happen.

(00:12:41):
And you are very familiar with those days as well, but you will have a practicability. You will leave the review thinking, "Shit, this is actually possible." The guy just inspired you that this is actually possible and you went in thinking it's not possible.

(00:12:52):
What I found is that at Airbnb, I learned a bunch of different things. One, I learned how to build products where software is just one part of the product. Let me explain that a little bit. The product of Airbnb isn't the app. It is a means to an end. The product of Airbnb is the memories you're going to create when you sit in that Airbnb beautiful house with your family, with your friends, and you're building those memories. That's the product. It's in real world.

(00:13:18):
And how you build a real world product which is of course powered by software, like the app, the website, et cetera, is different than just building a pure product that is purely software. I learned what is operations, how to scale operations, how to work with operations, how to create beautiful physical homes over there. The second thing I learned is just how to build great products.

(00:13:39):
I mean, I got I think a masterclass from Chesky in how to build products by watching him act, behave, and make decisions as well. And we'll talk about it later today. But I learned some of my fundamental product principles from him, and working with him and the team that he had assembled, the design leaders, the engineering leaders, et cetera. I learned a lot over there.

(00:13:59):
And last one but not least, there was still a hypergrowth thing. We were going through crazy growth. And then I learned what happens in leadership when coronavirus happens, the company starts to tank. It was a lesson in crisis management. I tell my friends I could not have gone to HBS Stanford business school to learn crisis management as much as I learned while being in the front row seat managing through that.

(00:14:23):
My learning as a product leader from Brian as a hyperscaler, taking the product management organization from 30, 40 people to 200 people, and last but not the least, managing the crisis. I felt like it all compressed into three years something that you will learn in 30.

Lenny (00:14:38):
I imagine you had no sense of that sort of path or trajectory or learning when you joined Airbnb, it was like, "Hmm, this is going to be a great company, little [inaudible 00:14:46] things."

Sanchan Saxena (00:14:47):
Yeah, absolutely. And oftentimes it's a joke, but I'll say it out anyhow. Oftentimes you meet leaders who are leaving Facebook, Amazon, Google, and it's like, "Hey, here's my Excel spreadsheet. Here's how I imagine the startup that I'm joining will grow. Here's the valuation. Here's my life. Here's my compensation. That's it." None of that shit is going to happen.

(00:15:05):
The companies have a different trajectory and you can't predict those things. So yeah, you're right. When I joined Airbnb, I thought it's going to be a walk in the park, just like Instagram was. I mean, Instagram wasn't a walk in the park. But relatively speaking, Instagram never experienced this kind of rapid pivoting of the reality, right?

(00:15:22):
I'll share with you I was there when Instagram had less than a hundred million monthly active users, $0 in revenue, 50 engineers, till it had 1 billion monthly active users, billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of employees. And I don't remember a time where the reality got bended so badly that we had to pivot.

(00:15:41):
In Airbnb's time, man, one fine morning in January, Brian and us were all talking about going IPO and taking the company public. Six weeks later, we are figuring out, "Damn, how do we make this company survive?" The revenues, if I'm not wrong, dropped to less in single digits of last year's revenue.

(00:16:00):
And there is no head of product, there is no CFO, there is no COO, whoever has a business plan to say, "Hmm, what are we going to do when our revenue drops to single digits of last year's revenue?"

(00:16:10):
I definitely didn't think that is what happened, but that's what ended up happening. Luckily, everything worked out, and I'm happy to share what we did and how we navigated through that with the audience, but it was some crazy, crazy times, man.

Lenny (00:16:21):
I was on the outside of that having left Airbnb a couple years prior and I was like, "Shit, what am I going to do now? I've been taking time off. There go all my Airbnb shares. I think I can get a job soon." And that's actually what led to the newsletter and starting to charge for the newsletter. But I'm very thankful for the turnaround that you helped create. I'd actually love to hear a bit more about what it is they did that helped them through that.

Sanchan Saxena (00:16:43):
I'll share with you the behind the scenes story that we went through. This is January, and Brian had this idea of taking the company public in April. And we are working on the road show deck, we are working through numbers, we were crafting the story, et cetera, everything's going well.

(00:16:59):
And then we hear of this coronavirus crisis and all of a sudden countries are shutting down, one after the other. Italy shuts down. Japan shuts down. This country shuts down. And all of a sudden we can see on our travel map, we have this dashboard where you can see where people are traveling, and you can see travel goes down to zero in this country on a map. This goes down to zero in this country, and you're like, "Holy shit, what's happening over here?"

(00:17:19):
I remember in all-hands where Brian stood up and said, "Look, we built this company for a crisis like this. We built this company, we have $2 billion in bank." I think something like that, some ridiculous number. "We have not used a single amount of money from our last raise," because we were profitable or growing really profitable. "And we are going to survive this."

(00:17:35):
Six weeks later, he's in the same all-hands and telling people, "This is a different world we are living in." We had to lay off 1,900 employees, just 190 of those were in my organization. We had to raise $2 billion in debt, and the valuation dropped to 50% of what the valuation was. It was one of the craziest times.

(00:17:53):
And Lenny, when you go through that, the loss of challenges you face, one is fine. You can cut costs by laying off employees for a little bit and create a little bit more runway. But remember, this is coronavirus time. I had to let go of people over Zoom. I couldn't even meet them in-person.

(00:18:09):
I still remember when I actually finished my speech and I told them, "This is the last day," now, I literally shed a tear in front of everybody, because I was like, "Man, this is hard. This is really, really hard." And the company let go of 1900 people. I just had to let go of 190 in my organization, but it was still very painful, because remember, it is no fault of these employees. They just happen to be at the wrong side of the tornado that's hitting the world.

(00:18:34):
The second equally most important thing was the people who stayed back, how do you motivate them? One is you can let go of the people, but people who stayed back, they need a light of hope that something is going to turn around. But how do you plan when data is changing every single day? And every day we will wake up, a new country will go down and say, "No, no more travels into our market".

(00:18:56):
And we start predicting that our revenue will be 7, 10, some ridiculous very small percent of last years. There's panic. And this is where I would say Brian Chesky is an incredible leader. He's the Rocky Balboa of Silicon valley. You can punch him, he'll go down, he'll stand up, he'll fight again. That's the analogy. He's truly the Rocky Balboa where he took so many punches, but he stood up again and say, "One more round."

(00:19:22):
And that's how the company survived. From an operating principle, we went into two week planning mode. Greg Greeley, who was the president of Airbnb used to say, "Look, can't plan for a year, can't plan for a quarter. We're going to plan every two weeks. We're going to react to every two weeks." And I think this is the lesson that I try to share with a lot of product people as well and founders as well is that things are going to go all right. Things are not going to go as you plan.

(00:19:47):
The real genius isn't to dot every eye, to cross every team before you get started. The real genius is, what do you do when shit goes wrong? And I believe rapid recovery is the key to success. What you do, how quickly you can recover from failure becomes really important. Our operating model changed. We went to two weeks shipping. All right, what are we doing for the next two weeks? What is the most urgent thing for the company? For the company. Not my team, not your team, not somebody else's team.

(00:20:13):
And we pivoted the entire machinery down over there. And then slowly and slowly after two or three months, we got to a place where we got semblance of what is happening. I want to tell you one story. Hotels and Airbnb are competitors, right? And when this thing happened, we had a debate, "How are we going to position Airbnb against hotels?" And actually we had to figure out what are the advantages of people staying in an Airbnb.

(00:20:35):
And luckily for us, being in an Airbnb where the air you breathe is only you and your family turned out to be a huge secret sauce to compete. When you're in a hotel, there's a lobby. You get to be with other people. But when you're are in an Airbnb, you're safe. We pivoted our marketing as well and messaging as well. The entire company came together to become one.

(00:20:55):
And through this, I would say Brian's leadership was just phenomenal, everything I learned about crisis management, leading with calmness. There's a very good saying in boxing. I love sports. There's a very good saying, which is, you can have all the plan. The moment you step inside the boxing and you get a punch on your face, all your plans go out the window. And you got to stay calm when you get a punch on your face.

(00:21:15):
And that is what I learned from Brian, how to stay calm, how to stay composed while at the same time, deep down you know you owe a lot to these employees, you know you owe a lot to these employees to have clarity, and for them to stick around with you and believe in you that the company can turn around. It was an amazing journey, but pretty painful.

Lenny (00:21:32):
Wow. I haven't heard that level of detail about what went on inside, and so thank you for sharing all that. Very tactically, I'm curious, the two week planning cycles, how did that actually happen? Was there a large meeting every two weeks with the leaders and they just kind of discuss, "Here's where we're thinking for the next two weeks."?

Sanchan Saxena (00:21:48):
Yeah, I think so. One of the things about Airbnb, and we'll talk about it later as well, but it's a very founder-driven company. While there are leaders over there, the founder is deeply in the trenches. He really understands the customer. He's not this executive who's so far removed from reality that they can't actually create the content.

(00:22:04):
Brian was living, breathing that exercise. Execs were breathing that thing. What we'll do is we'll have a bunch of things top-down. Again, this is what we need to do guys. We need to cut this feature. We need to cut this product line. We need to cut this business unit. I literally had to shut down one full business unit because we had to cut the bleeding, so to say, and let go of those many people.

(00:22:24):
It was a top-down mandate, but also it was a bottom-up. The engineers, the product managers and designers are frontline. They are in connection with the CX team who's hearing what customers are complaining about. And so there was a mixture of top-down guidance to a bottoms-up things that we are seeing on the field. And every two weeks or so, the leadership, Greg in that case, for example, would make a decision on, "Here are the things we are going to go handle." And there were no teams anymore.

(00:22:50):
We basically dissolved this idea that there are sub-teams. There was one team, #Airbnb. Didn't matter whether you worked in CX or Airbnb Plus or Lax, or any of those things, we're going to move engineers wherever we have to, we're going to move PMs wherever we need to, and there's no such thing as sub-team anymore.

(00:23:09):
A lot of engineers on my team would go on to do marketplace dynamic stuff, like pricing and all that stuff, while some of those engineers would then go on to build CX tools or something else that was needed for survival. I felt like a 4,000 people company was operating as a four people company and a 40 people company, which is one team, no sub-teams, everybody rowing in the same direction. And that was really important.

(00:23:31):
Because remember, employees who are at your company are looking for clarity. What should they work on? Is the thing that they're going to work on meaningful, right? Because nobody knows, right? And when people will ask you as a leader, like many people ask me, what does six months look like? What does a year look like? Where are we a year from now?

(00:23:46):
The most honest answer you can tell them is, "I don't know." Because if you cook shit up, they're going to see through that lie. They're going to like, "Ah, this is just all marketing fluff." We would be very honest as leaders, would be very vulnerable as leaders, saying, "This is truly once in a lifetime thing. We don't know how we're going to navigate. But here's what we believe to be true."

(00:24:05):
We had to get people from feature obsession, revenue obsession, to belief obsession. What is belief obsession? When we all believe that when coronavirus is over, people will want to travel. We all believe that coronavirus will be over. You start going into first principles belief-based thinking, and you'll bring stories that will make people believe that the future that we are working toward is actually possible.

(00:24:28):
For example, there was a survey we did, we said, "If money wasn't a consideration, what would you do for the rest of your life?" 99.99% of the people said, "I will travel the world." Travel is in human genes. And so we had to pivot to actually making people believe why travel will be back, why Airbnb will survive, and why Airbnb will eventually thrive if the coronavirus crisis is lower.

Lenny (00:24:51):
These stories are incredible. I was going to ask around the morale piece. You mentioned keeping morale up. And it sounds like a big piece of that was pulling people back to the mission and the vision of Airbnb and re-inspiring them, and helping them feel like this will work out. Is that what you found to be most effective, to keep more morale up, or is there anything else that also helped keep more morale up in this very tenuous time?

Sanchan Saxena (00:25:11):
I think in these tenuous times you will notice that you can't pay these employees better than market. When this happened, FAANG companies were at our door trying to poach our engineers. Overnight, every engineer was pinged by Facebook, Google say, "Hey, we heard Airbnb is going down. You want to come over? We'll pay you X amount of money, and that stock is stable."

(00:25:34):
You had vultures at the door, so to say, as a proverbial exercise where your top talent is getting poached, but you can't pay this top talent the best. Right? You can't. Because your financial situation doesn't allow you to do that, right? But you still give them something, right? Because it's at a lower price and you start to sell the vision that if the company turns around, this will be at a higher price and you'll have right compensation. But those were some of the challenges.

(00:25:56):
The second challenge is you'll notice that people who thrive in these situations will be the one who truly believe both in the mission, but I think more importantly in the founders to make that mission come to life. Because you and I both know, right, there are many companies who have the similar mission, want to do something similar, but some succeed and some don't.

(00:26:17):
And the secret sauce of that in my opinion is the founder. And if the employees do not believe in the founder, if the employees do not believe that the founder can make things happen as they talk about, and the founder is not able to connect with the employees, those companies go down in flames. The second thing I would say is the founder needs to be at the front line. And Brian Chesky was on the front line.

(00:26:37):
He was literally 24/7 available, interacting, making decisions, holding all-hands, writing emails, sending messages, and assuring people that I'm in this with you. By the way, there's a proverbial thing, right? When such situations happen, all execs take a pay cut. Every company does that, right? But then still certain companies survive, certain don't, right?

(00:26:58):
It's primarily because of the founder. And then the third thing I would say is somehow getting people to believe in the future that they came here to create. When drastic situations like these happens, when I joined Airbnb I had a vision of what it can become, and the reality snaps and all of a sudden like, "Holy shit. Is that even possible?"

(00:27:21):
That is the real art I learned from Brian is that the power of storytelling without any data. Your data is telling you, "You're going to die." The data is telling you, you got 7%, 10% of your revenue, whatever the number was now. I forget now. Like single digit number, right?

(00:27:36):
And every day you're seeing the numbers go down, right? And Brian has this incredible ability to help you see a future in a way so crystal clear that when you leave chatting with him, you're like, "Man, it's possible. We can make it happen. We can do it." That trait was really, really important that Brian invested in it, and all the three founders, by the way.

What are things you've seen the leaders at those companies do that have stuck with you that you're going to take to other places that are maybe unique?

Sanchan Saxena (00:29:06):
Yeah, I think a lot of amazing things. I tell people, I learned all things about building great products, building great businesses, building great companies from founders like Kevin Systrom and Brian Chesky, Brian Armstrong and others. Well, let me go back to Instagram days. I want to paint the picture first of what it was when I got there and the journey we were on.

(00:29:23):
At that time, Instagram was a highly successful app that was growing really fast, but there were many questions. Only photos, you can't share anything outside. It's only from the camera. You can't share links. At Facebook they allow you to share links. Why don't you allow that, right? There's an existential question that comes at those stages, which is who do you want to be when you grow up?

(00:29:45):
When you're a startup, that's a big, important question for you to answer. And there were many debates. "Do we want to be the next Facebook? Do we want to be the first Instagram? Who do we want to be when we grow up?" Right? And that debate is really, really important. That clarity is really important for your employees.

(00:30:02):
The thing that I learned from Kevin Systrom was the power of simplicity. That guy can listen to everything, hear everything, hear the noise on Twitter, here, there, all the customers complaining, and then just simplify things that makes sense for the team to operate on. That's his superpower, which is simplicity. Take all the information, but simplify your strategy, your belief, who you want to be when you grow up in a way that people can then act on it.

(00:30:28):
The other thing I learned from him was intentionality. This is the story of Instagram Stories. When Snapchat came about, Snapchat was eating Facebook and Instagram as lunch in many regards, because the Snapchat Stories was crushing it. And there are lots of myths, by the way, in the media, how that happened.It was a mandate from Zuck.

(00:30:47):
No, Zuck did not have a mandate. There was no such thing. It was something that people were experimenting. I want to tell you a story, two stories, which is stories in Facebook app and stories inside of Instagram app, and stories for your audience is the stuff that Snapchat invented, all credit to them. In product management, you always debate measure twice, cut once kind of a thinking. It's like measure the data, get all the data, right? Get all the analysis, ask customers, et cetera.

(00:31:12):
Some of the successful founders don't do that. Some of the successful founders go off of gut and instincts more than they go off of data. And that to me is a superpower of a founder is like they have this instinct, their vision. I'll tell you a story. On Instagram side, Kevin Systrom made a decision. We're going all in on this new format. There was no A/B testing that if you add stories at the top ...

(00:31:34):
I mean, there were a little bit of A/B testing, but not like, "Okay, let's go measure. If you add stories at the top, the feed will go down as a result. Engagement will drop as a result. Revenue will draw. And as a result, we should not do it." There was no such thing. The founder said, "We're going all in people. This is the future. We're not going to measure and then cut. We're going to cut. And then we are going to iterate from that new baseline. We're going to continue to iterate on that on the Facebook side."

(00:31:57):
And by the way, there's a very good article that some PM inside of Facebook wrote why stories didn't survive at Facebook but thrived at Instagram is because on that side there was a mathematical modeling being created, which is what are the trade-offs. And you have a successful business. And this is the innovator's dilemma. You have a successful business called feed that is generating billions of dollars.

(00:32:16):
And you got to bring in this new thing, which has zero advertisers, we don't even know if the engagement will be there or not, and you got to put those things together. There was a very different approach that Facebook took for stories versus Instagram. And by the way, there was no this rumor in the media there was a top-down man. No, these teams were just experimenting. They were just trying things out.

(00:32:35):
We always want to look at our competition, be inspired by what's working, what's not. There's no harm in learning from somebody who's doing something great and experiment and see if that works for you or not. That was the story. And the thing that I learned from Systrom was intentionality. As a founder, one of the things you have to recognize, or even as a product leader, you have to recognize is that every product that you build should be intentional in nature.

(00:32:57):
An intentionality doesn't come just from A/B testing. A/B testing maybe you can do that, right, as a later on, but you got to have intentionality. Where do you want to go? What is the world you want to create for your customers? And then create out A/B testing to get you the fastest route to that end state world. When I talk to product managers, oftentimes I tell them you're being either too lazy or you're trying to be too risk averse by telling me, "Here are the assumptions you have that you're going to test."

(00:33:24):
First tell me the intentionality of the product that you want to create. What do you want to see come true? And then let's talk about the A/B test we can run to measure that we are headed in the right direction. And it's a flipping of the mind. And that was something that Brian also taught me. By the way, it's a joke, but some degree it's reality too. A/B testing at Airbnb is a bad word.

(00:33:44):
You don't go to Brian and say, "Hey Brian, here's my Excel spreadsheet. I want to run some 10 A/B tests and come back and tell you whether we are heading in the right direction." You're going to get thrown out of the window. It's like, "No, we got to figure out what the product is." The other thing I learned with Brian Chesky was you first want to create an ideal end state of the product without any constraint.

(00:34:05):
Here's a good analogy that Brian will teach people. Let's say you want to build Airbnb. What is the 15 out of 10 experience you want to create? That's where Airbnb designers and PM start by the way. In most companies, the designers and PM start by saying, "Okay, 10 is perfect. We can probably do seven. Let's start at seven." It's a very constrained minded thinking. It's like, "I got this much time. I got this many resources. I got this much budget. I can only do so much." Right?

(00:34:31):
And what Brian taught us was think unconstrained first. Think about a 15 out of 10 experience, design the ideal end state first. I'll give you a very concrete example of this. Let's say you're building Airbnb lounges. A customer's check in is at 3:00 PM, but their flight is at 6:00 AM. What are you going to do? Well, you got to build a lounge, right?

(00:34:50):
If you're traditionally trained in product management, this is what you'll do, which is, look, I don't know how to build this in 120 countries. I don't know how to scale this stuff. So I'm going to ignore some ideas and I'm going to build a MVP lounge. And then I want to say, "Okay, if I add internet access to it, customer detention went up by way. If I add coffee to it, this went up by Z.If I add cheers to it, it went up by X," and hence I'm going to justify how to build a beautiful mall.

(00:35:15):
That's not what you will do if you're Brian Chesky. Here's what you'll do. You will pick one location because you don't know how to scale a lounge in 120 countries. Pick one location. But you know how to get in one location a barista who can create coffee, you know in one location how to get the best seats, you know in one location how to get the best air conditioning, you know that right. Build the best possible lovable product first.

(00:35:38):
And then from that point on, understand what worked, what did not, and then scale the pieces that actually worked. It's a very different way of thinking about things, doing things that don't scale it first. Those are different things I learned at Instagram and Airbnb.

Lenny (00:35:50):
So much good stuff there that we could do a podcast at each learning. And that point about working backwards from the ideal, that's something I've absolutely taken away also from Airbnb and news often. If folks want to learn a bit more about that, if you Google Snow White Airbnb, there's a whole story about Snow White that kind of touches on where a lot of this idea came from.

(00:36:08):
I want to follow up on one point you made about intentionality. See your founder or PM and you're just like, "Oh, yeah. Okay. I'm just going to figure out a vision, and this is where we need to go. And I need to be intentional, so I'm just going to tell people here's where we're going." Oftentimes you're wrong.

(00:36:24):
Do you have any thoughts for someone trying to decide how do I know if I'm going in the right direction, how do I know if I should trust this gut that I have versus running A/B test, because otherwise we don't know? Do you have any thoughts on that?

Sanchan Saxena (00:36:35):
Absolutely. I think there are lots of things to unpack there. The first and foremost thing I'd say is that when you sit in your car, you tell your GPS, "Here's where I want to go." You never go into your car and say, "Hey, GPS, tell me where I should go." Right? At least I haven't done that. And then you use the GPS to run an A/B test, say, "Look, I want to get there in the fastest way possible."

(00:36:58):
GPS then figures out the path to get there in the fastest way, or sometimes tell the GPS, "I'm low on gas. Take me a gas efficient route that I can get there, or [inaudible 00:37:07]." Those are A/B tests. But you never say to the GPS that, "I don't want to go to San Francisco. Tell me where I should go." It's a similar concept around intentionality.

(00:37:19):
You got to start first and foremost with, where do you want to go? What is the true customer problem that you want to solve? And why does that matter? The second thing I'll say is, oftentimes, product leaders discount gut or intuition a lot. And the reason is it's a safe thing to do. You can always point to data and say, "Look, I did this because of this. And if I fail, here's the data. And don't fire me." I'm just joking.

(00:37:44):
But you get the extreme of it, right? It's very hard to build a team and build your reputation and get an intuition. But the thing is, founders do exactly that. There was no document that said, "10 years later Facebook will make billions of dollars in revenue," or no document that said, "Coinbase one day will become a hundred billion dollar company if you invest in that at that point in time." You got to have gut and intuition. And founders have that and operators need to learn how to harness that as well.

(00:38:07):
And to me, gut and intuition is data. It's just not statistically significant yet. That's all it is. You have built that intuition, that gut, because you immerse yourself in a situation, you hung out with customers, you understood what was happening. You just can't prove it that it is statistically significant yet.Don't discount your gut. That's the second point.

(00:38:28):
And the third point that I'll say is, once you have figured out what that experience looks like, yes, you got to validate what's happening, you got to get feedback back from the community while launching it, and then you got to constantly iterate. My advice to people is, don't do that testing up front, start with some assumption, start with a bunch of intuition, et cetera. Create that and then have the appetite to actually persist through that.

(00:38:51):
That's another thing I learned from Brian is that oftentimes these ideas, these crazy ideas, you need persistence. He used to say, "You got to have impatience with getting started, but patience for seeing them through." Because at many other companies, you can actually kill a brilliant idea early on because you just didn't have the patience to see that through.

(00:39:11):
You got to start with intentionality and then you got to iterate and test, and iterate and test, and iterate and test. But don't give up too early either. And last but not the least, I'll tell a secret to all your audios.

Lenny (00:39:21):
Oh boy, here we go.

Sanchan Saxena (00:39:23):
Nobody knows everything. Right? The idea is that you can look at as much data as you want, which is still not going to feel that all the answers. What is really important? The really important thing is rapid recovery. Build a culture in your team where failure of those experiments is actually celebrated.

(00:39:41):
Build a culture in the team where actually people get energized when they fail, because guess what, each failure was a learning that will avoid a mistake for them in the future. Right? And I think that is the mindset and culture you want to build. Look at data, look at all the things. But at the same time, don't just look at that and say, "Look, because the data said so, that is what I'm going to do." I'm going to use a very good analogy over here.

(00:40:03):
And this story has been butchered many times, but I was right there when this happened, so my version is at least 80% accurate. There might be other versions as well. But this is Instagram Stories. Imagine you are Kevin Systrom and data science comes to you and say, "Look, I looked at data, and 99% of all photos on people's phones are actually at least a week old. Please allow Instagram Stories to let people select a photo that is at least a week or two old."

(00:40:30):
Then user research comes back and says, "We talked to a bunch of people. They said, 'Yes, I would love to share a story of my birthday about a month ago.'" Right? And Kevin Systrom says, "No, my intentionality is that story should be real time news. It should be the world's largest TV channel. You open that up and you see what's happening right now. That is the intentionality I'm going towards."

(00:40:51):
In the beginning, Instagram Stories did not let you pick anything that was not real time. You couldn't go back in your camera and pick something a month ago or two ago, because the intentionality of the product was to create the world's largest real time network of what's happening in the world right now. If that's the intentionality, you got to ignore the other customer needs that I want to share with the world what I did a month ago, and that changes the dynamics.

Lenny (00:41:14):
Essentially, intentionality is setting up vision for where you want to go, where the product's going and then working away towards it. That makes a lot of sense. An example of Instagram. It's interesting because he eventually changed his mind, because I know that you can upload old photos to stories [inaudible 00:41:28]

Sanchan Saxena (00:41:27):
No, that's actually after he left. But yes, you're right.

Lenny (00:41:29):
Okay, I see. A different intentionality appeared.

Sanchan Saxena (00:41:34):
And look, it's also nothing wrong with changing your mind afterwards once you push the envelope, and then you learn something new and you can pivot. And that's another beauty of founders is that they're very intentional people, very strong opinionated people, but in the face of something new, they're also the fastest to change. They don't have remorsefulness, they don't have regrets, and like, "Yeah. All right, let's pivot." And that is the culture you want to build as well as an operator.

Lenny (00:41:57):
I'd love to spend a little time on Coinbase and the product culture there. How A/B test driven is it at Coinbase? How do folks think about intentionally vision? And also just, what's the product development process like? I'm always curious how products is developed at different companies.

Sanchan Saxena (00:42:10):
I think all different companies that I've worked at have very different product development cultures. At Airbnb, for example, design and experience was super paramount, and you will not compromise over it. You won't cut design to ship. In other companies you will cut design to ship sometimes because you want to find something quickly.

(00:42:26):
At Coinbase, it's slightly different as well. Every company has their nuances. Coinbase is an industry which is rapidly growing. It's Web 3.0. I mean, I have not come across a Web 3.0 expert yet. There is nobody who's an expert in Web 3.0.

Lenny (00:42:40):
They seem to be on Twitter.

Sanchan Saxena (00:42:41):
Yeah. There are lots of people who think they're experts on Twitter. But the reality is, man, the industry is so nascent, so early. You have good intentions and good intuition about where it could go, but it's very hard to be right all the time. The culture of Coinbase is to take big, bold bets, get started with very tiny teams.

(00:43:00):
The Coinbase NFT marketplace that we just launched, it started with five people, one product manager, one designer and other three engineers. That's how smart it start. And of course it has grown big now as we find product market fit, etcetera, et cetera. But that's the idea is take big, bold swings, but with tiny teams that can move at lightning speed and make shit happen, because that's one aspect of it.

(00:43:22):
The other culture that I love about Coinbase is this idea of how we make decisions. Emily, our COO, posted a blog. It's public. You guys can all read it. It's a very different mindset of making decisions, so let me unpack that. When I was at Facebook, Instagram and other companies, other tech companies, there's a saying around product and design, marketing. All these cross functional people need to come together to build a product.

(00:43:45):
And oftentimes you will notice that the decision making process could get a little bit convoluted, not always, but a little bit convoluted. It's like, okay, what do you like? What do you don't like? You got to align influence, align influence. And next thing you know ... And again, I'm not saying always, but sometimes it can happen that the thing that ends up shipping is the least common denominator that annoyed everybody the least amount, right?

(00:44:09):
Everybody said, "Yeah, I could get comfortable with that. I could get comfortable with that." And Brian has an allergic reaction to things like committees. It's like designing by committee. The idea that we have, and you can read it in her blog, is the idea of a directly responsible individual or DRI.

(00:44:26):
For every project, we'll establish a DRI. It could be a person in operations, engineering, design, legal, marketing, whatever that is, depending on the nature of the project. And DRI's job is to then listen to the cross functional partners, get their input. And we have a written culture like Amazon, so every input is provided in writing. Right?

(00:44:45):
You can see what head of legal is saying. You can see what your head of operations is saying, what engineering is saying in writing. And then the DRI's job is to take all that input and make a decision. Not take all that input and do necessarily what's right by everybody, right? Still do what's right by the customer. Still do what's right by the business. Still do what's right for the user in many regards.

(00:45:07):
But take that input, inform yourself with all the right things, but it's your job to then make the final call. Whoever you might be, sometimes it's operations, sometimes it's engineering, sometimes it's design and product, and others then have to disagree and champion that for you. I might go in and I might write in that rapid, "I disagree with this. Here are the reasons why."

(00:45:27):
But the decider the DRI has to make that decision. And once that decision is made, I got to disagree and commit to it and champion it with the rest of the team as if it was my decision. It's not just disagree and commit, it's disagree and champion. Go out there and evangelize that this is the right thing to do. Now, there are lots of advantages of that.

(00:45:43):
It cuts all the passive aggressive behaviors that all of us have seen in different companies. It's like, "Ah, I got to go talk to this head of X, and I got to be nice. I got to make sure we have this relationship." And the decision gets dragged over two, three months, because the speed of decision making is directly proportional to the strength of your relationship in those companies, right?

(00:46:02):
Here, the speed of decision making is directly proportional to the person who's directly responsible from making that decision happen. And it is, of course, incumbent upon that person to listen and get unsolicited advice. But at the end of the day, they're the single [inaudible 00:46:16]. They're the final DRI. It's a very different culture than any place I've worked in. And when you join Coinbase, we have to orient you by saying, "Look, this is how you operate," very different than any other company.

Lenny (00:46:28):
That's so interesting. Is that how big decisions are made or does that filter down to even individual teams where a PM or whoever is a DRI in a team makes decisions this way?

Sanchan Saxena (00:46:37):
Individual people as well. You will see PMs writing, engineers writing, and operations and legal writing a rapid. It's called rapid. It's for rapid decision making. And it's the same format that I would use if I want Brian to make a decision. It's the same format someone will use inside their team.

(00:46:52):
Let's say you are working on a particular project, you will write that rapid. It's the same exact format, same exact mechanism, and every team uses those mechanisms to actually scale. Otherwise, decision making can actually be the [inaudible 00:47:05] of hypergrowth companies.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Is there anything else that's unique about how Coinbase operates that's stuck with you that you might take to a future company that you may work at if you ever leave Coinbase?

Sanchan Saxena (00:47:14):
Yeah. I think decision making is one. I think just the idea of how to operate in such an ambiguous industry. When I got to Airbnb, ambiguity was a lot, because it was the first time we were doing home sharing as an example, right? And it was not done before. But you had had the overall understanding of the travel industry, the customer, the regulation, et cetera, et cetera.

(00:47:33):
But I think [inaudible 00:47:35] is a very ridiculously new thing. People sometimes ask me what's the future of NFD, I say, "Ta-da! I don't know," I'll experiment, figure it out. I have an opinion. I'll take that opinion and start to execute against it, but nobody knows. How do you build conviction in a highly noisy world?

(00:47:50):
I mean, Web 3.0, as you're probably on Twitter, everybody has an opinion on Twitter. X should do Y, and Y should do Z, and this is how it should be. Right?And the thing that I would take with me everywhere is, how do you build in that noise? How do you stay focused and still build what you believe is the right thing and still let the noise happen around you?

(00:48:09):
And I think as Web 3.0 advances and every company becomes a Web 3.0 company, that's at least my prediction in this decade, just like every company became a mobile company, didn't have a mobile app, but became a mobile company, I think every company will become a Web 3.0 company. Everybody will have to build that muscle of operating in that level of ambiguity where there's literally no data and lot of noise.

Lenny (00:48:28):
Is there some way of operating at Coinbase that allows them to operate in this ambiguity and focus? Is there something that you've seen there?

Sanchan Saxena (00:48:36):
Yeah. I mean, we have our own flaws. I mean, no, company is perfect. We have our own flaws. But what we have figured out is how to operate, just the way I described before, which is a DRI mindset culture. Instead of having 15 people have 15 different perspectives, et cetera, it should all be amalgamated into one rapid.

(00:48:51):
And we trust our leaders. We trust the DRI, whoever that DRI is, to make the decision. And then we start going towards the same direction. We ignore all the noise over there. Again, no company is perfect yet. We are still learning, but this is something I found to be very effective.

Lenny (00:49:03):
On the thread of Web 3.0, if someone's thinking about like, "Should I get into a Web 3.0 sort of company? Should I not?" what sort of people do you find are most successful maybe on the product side specifically, but even broadly, folks that may enjoy the world of Web 3.0 and others that maybe not?

Sanchan Saxena (00:49:18):
Yeah, I think Web 3.0 is definitely at a stage right now where I'm seeing a lot of influx of people from Web 2.0 world. Literally, if I look at my LinkedIn post, there's somebody saying, "Ta-da! I left X and I'm joining a Web 3.0 company." So there's already.

Lenny (00:49:32):
Or starters pivoting to Web 3.0 in your entire team.

Sanchan Saxena (00:49:35):
Exactly, starters pivoting to Web 3.0 as well. I feel like when I joined ... I mean, I joined very recently. I mean, not long time ago. When I joined, it was a very different conversation. I was still telling execs and others at Google and Facebook, "This is why you should join. This is what's happening," et cetera, but now I feel like the world is slightly different.

(00:49:52):
I think the people who will thrive or who thrive in Web 3.0 are people who truly are able to understand the potential and disregard the constraints of today. And here's what I mean by that. You all have seen articles written by really influential celebrities saying, "Web 3.0 sucks." And let me tell you why, because today sucks, right? We agree with the future principles of Web 3.0 of decentralization, this and that. But look at today, everything is centralized. Everything is blah, blah, blah.

(00:50:21):
I always remind those people as like the path to Web 3.0 goes, and from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 goes through web 2.5. It doesn't go straight from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. It goes through web 2.5. You got to go through that journey. And a lot of stuff that's happening in Web 3.0 today is web 2.5, 2.7 kind of. There's no truly decentralized stuff that is there, but the idealism is there. The closest thing is Ethereum probably, or Bitcoin.

(00:50:42):
The idealism is there and we want to get to the towards that, right? The people who will thrive most are people who understand those ideals, understand the future and are builders. They want to take what it is today and then morph it into the ideals of tomorrow. I remember I'm a history buff and I love watching the history of technology.

(00:51:02):
And there's a video on YouTube which describes someone playing with the internet back in 1986, '87, '89, right? And what you had to do was if I wanted to visit Lenny's website, here's what I'll do. I'll type 192. whatever the IP address was, and then I'm going to hit enter on a blue screen. And then there'll be things coming down and I'll pay $200 to just access his website.

(00:51:23):
[inaudible 00:51:23] too, right? But if you can get past that and see that someday Lenny and I will actually have a podcast, video podcast or YouTube podcast over the internet, and we'll be able to see each other and record that shit, that is powerful. We are looking for people at this stage who believe in that journey.

Lenny (00:51:43):
I love that. And just the idea of hiring and joining company, I wanted to touch on hiring advice. You're really good at hiring. You've hired many people, you've interviewed tons and tons of PMs, and so I just wanted to touch on this before we wrap up.

(00:51:56):
I find that hiring and just finding people as maybe the single biggest pain point for companies these days and startups especially. Do you have any advice for our founders or product leaders or just leaders in general for hiring, including finding people and closing them, that kind of thing?

Sanchan Saxena (00:52:10):
Yeah. I think maybe I can focus a little bit about what are some of the things that I believe are incredibly important for startups to get right when they're hiring. The couple of things to remember is that what really matters, what's highly code related to a startup success isn't that they used a process like scrum, like this, like that.

(00:52:30):
Well, what's highly correlated is that somebody bloody knew what to do when. That is the most important thing. And I call that content. Content means what you do when. Process means how you do the thing that I just said. And I think there's a very easy love affection towards process.

(00:52:50):
And I think Reed Hastings has talked about this in their culture deck. Steve jobs has also talked about in the past is that, oftentimes we gravitate towards people who know how to avoid mistakes, who know how to create a process. Here's what a typical cycle is. You get bigger and bigger, you start making mistakes, you're like, "Oh, we got to create a process so we don't make the same mistake again."

(00:53:07):
And next thing you know, over a period of time, the process becomes the product. Every morning you wake up, you look at your calendar, 80% of the time as an exec you are moving the process, you are managing the process, and that process becomes the product, and you lose sight of what the real product is, who your real customers are.

(00:53:24):
My advice to people, especially in early stage startups is bring in people who know content and teach them process, as opposed to bringing in people who know process and trying to teach them content, because that's a bloody hard thing to do.

(00:53:36):
And this obsession about a lot of funders ask me when I consult with them is like, "Should we do scrum? Should we do X, Y, Z process?" I'm like, "You can do whatever you want. It doesn't matter. You can try any of those things. It will not be correlated to your success." And maybe to some degree, but not a lot of degree.

(00:53:52):
What you really need to figure out is, who do you hire, who can actually understand what the content of your product is, what the content of your customers is? How do you win in that industry that you're operating in? And make sure that you stay obsessed over there, right, as opposed to the process. This is something that Brian Chesky has grilled in me.

(00:54:09):
Hire executives who know how to execute. And his idea was, let's say Sanchan's entire team disappears, and then I go to Brian and say, "Hey, Brian, I got to hire this organization, I got to hire these people, and then I'll tell you what to build, or I'll then build." Right? Now I should be able to then crawl up my sleeve, if I'm a content kind of a leader, and I should do exactly what my team did.

(00:54:29):
Maybe not with the same capacity, because if I have so many people team, I can't do so many people worth of work. But at least be able to tell you, "This is what we should build. This is when we should build. This is how we should build." Right? I shouldn't be a leader who just delegates to the extent that I forgot what content is, right? And that is a very important piece.

Lenny (00:54:46):
When you're looking for a leader like that, because that sounds amazing, what do you look for? How do you know if there's that sort of leader when you're interviewing or just kind of evaluating?

Sanchan Saxena (00:54:55):
One of the things we did at Airbnb, because this was the thesis that we had over there, we actually changed our interview process around this. We will give people a work challenge. You're very familiar with that. Most people say, "Come and do a presentation." No, we actually gave you a work challenge.

(00:55:08):
We said, "This is the problem you're facing. How are you going to solve it?" Right. We're facing Airbnb Plus problem, we need to build millions of homes that are Airbnb Plus, but we don't know how to do that. What would you do? And we want to see the depth of thinking. They don't know the right answer because they don't have the right data. That's okay. Right?

(00:55:24):
But they at least need to show us how they approach the problem. What are they going to do? And they need to show us the content of how they're going to do. Some people will come in and say, and have seen slides in those presentation, they'll come in and say, "Here's my process. Ideation, execution, iteration." That's okay. I want to know what you're going to do inside of ideation.

(00:55:42):
Some execs will come in presenter say, "Well, the first thing I'm going to do is go out there and figure out are their third party companies who can actually scale my operations without building it in now." That is content, right? And I want to evaluate that.

(00:55:53):
The second thing we will do is in our interview process as well, if it's an exec, Brian will spend time and I will spend time, anybody else will spend time, we will focus on whatever you did in the past, tell me the role that you played in that versus telling me everything that your team did. Right? To be precise, the role you played.

(00:56:11):
And this is something I tell a lot of my folks at Coinbase as well is like, you got to be able to bring things to me, escalate to me when you need my help and let me help you be successful. My role is such that I have a large team and I can't do everything. But what I can do is set them up for success. How? Of course, the tactical supply of resources.

(00:56:32):
But more importantly, when we are thinking about the content, when we think about what to do, when to do, how to do it, let's sit together and think about that. Escalate to me, bring things to me. I will go into the mud with you and I'll create that clay for you, with you. And that is how I stay relevant. But more importantly, that is the value that I get to help my team succeed as well.

Lenny (00:56:51):
I love that. I was just thinking that the fact that you call kind of the roadmap and the plan like a content, that makes you a content creator, and how does that feel?

Sanchan Saxena (00:57:00):
Yes, that does feel good. I mean, you should have the ability to create a roadmap and that is your creating content around that. But the thing that I want to make sure people understand is that the format of that roadmap doesn't matter. Whether you use Excel, or this, or that, it doesn't matter. That process doesn't matter.

(00:57:15):
What matters is that you were able to come up with the right roadmap, which is what you're going to build, at what time you're going to build. And that is a core value set of an individual or a leader that you should absolutely look for.

(00:57:26):
And so otherwise, my prediction is four or five years later or whatever the time is, that company will start to attract process people, and next thing you know, everybody in the company is a process person and nobody is a content person.

(00:57:38):
And then what hands up happening is the founder ends up taking that burden of becoming the content person, and next thing you know, they can't scale. They just cannot scale. The company cannot scale.

Lenny (00:57:47):
Yeah, because process eventually just kind of starts to break down.

Sanchan Saxena (00:57:50):
Exactly. There's a very good deck. I'll encourage your audience to watch the Netflix Culture Deck. And Reed Hastings talks about this at length, better than I did. And it's a beautiful concept, it's a beautiful argument, and I think I will encourage every follower to start looking for that.

(00:58:04):
And again, I'm not saying process shouldn't exist. You absolutely need some process. That's why you can scale. You can't scale without some process as well. But process is not the answer. Content is the answer.

Lenny (00:58:13):
I feel like I've taken enough of your time. And so we've gotten to the final part of our chat, which is the lightning round, where I'm going to ask you a few questions and then just tell me what first thing that comes to mind. If nothing comes to mind, that's totally cool too. Does that sound good?

Sanchan Saxena (00:58:27):
Yeah, that sounds great, man.

Lenny (00:58:28):
Okay. What's a book that you recommend most to other product leaders?

Sanchan Saxena (00:58:33):
Two books come to mind. One is The Little Bets, which is how you live your life and how you build businesses with little bets. And the other thing I would say The Innovator's Dilemma. Those are two of my favorite books and highly recommend everybody reading those.

Lenny (00:58:46):
Awesome. What's a company that you recommend most to PMs that are looking for a new job other than Coinbase?

Sanchan Saxena (00:58:53):
Yeah. I mean, I think there are tons of Web 3.0 companies or tons of other companies. I would say amongst the companies [inaudible 00:58:58], the insights say where it is. I think Airbnb is a great company. People should definitely look at that company. It is once in a lifetime kind of a company as well, and people will enjoy working over there.

Lenny (00:59:07):
Agreed. What's your favorite app right now?

Sanchan Saxena (00:59:09):
My favorite app right now, Coinbase NFT.

Lenny (00:59:13):
Shit, I should have said other than Coinbase. All right, you get that.

Sanchan Saxena (00:59:16):
I would say I love TikTok. I am on TikTok all the time. I love how entertaining it is. I love how simple it is. I'm on TikTok all the time.

Lenny (00:59:27):
Same. We're in trouble. Who is your favorite manager that you had?

Sanchan Saxena (00:59:31):
Oh, my favorite manager. It was my first manager. His name is Sashi. He was at Microsoft. And he fundamentally helped change the trajectory of my life. He believed in me. And I was just out of college at that time. And he invested in me. The most important thing was he invested in me. If any successful person you meet in your life, one thing they will all tell you is at some point in their life, somebody believed in them and somebody invested in them, and that was that manager.

Lenny (00:59:54):
Amazing. And then finally, what's a favorite interview question that you like to use?

Sanchan Saxena (00:59:59):
Tell me the story of your career and focus more on why you did what you did. And I ask this question because the resume is full of polished shit. It's like, "Oh, I did this. I did this." Right? I want to hear the story. And tell me why you did what you did. And that tells me a lot about the person when they're answering the question, not the what. Because I can see that on the LinkedIn or the resume, but why, why they chose to do what they chose to do.

Lenny (01:00:23):
I love that. Where can folks find you online, and then how can listeners be helpful to you?

Sanchan Saxena (01:00:27):
Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty active on Twitter. Now that you know, I'm also active on TikTok. But Twitter is probably the best place to follow me. And yeah, if you have any suggestion, anything you want to chat about, send me a message on Twitter, DM me, or LinkedIn. One of those places and I'll be happy to chat with you.

Lenny (01:00:43):
And I imagine folks should check out Coinbase NFT and Coinbase Wallet?

Sanchan Saxena (01:00:47):
Absolutely, man.

Lenny (01:00:48):
How do people find that?

Sanchan Saxena (01:00:50):
Nft.coinbase.com. Give it a shot and let us know what you think.

Lenny (01:00:52):
Amazing. Thank you so much, Sanchan, for being here. This was amazing.

Sanchan Saxena (01:00:55):
Thank you, Lenny, for having me.

Lenny (01:00:58):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at Lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# The hierarchy of engagement | Sarah Tavel (Benchmark, Greylock, Pinterest)

## Transcript

Sarah Tavel (00:00:00):
I think a lot of people think about markets almost like these bodies of water, it's like it's this big body of water that we're going after. I actually think that the most interesting markets, you have to think of them like currents where you're there's something happening in the market that's creating this current where you can have a plank of wood that you've put on the river and it's going to pull you forward. Versus a market that doesn't really have that momentum to it, you're going to have to build something really big and fancy to make any progress. That's why we care less about market size because really, what you're looking for when you're looking at a market, are what are the dynamics of change, what's the current and momentum that's going to pull the company and make the job easier for the founders to actually build something that endures. 

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Sarah Tavel. Sarah is a partner at Benchmark, one of the most preeminent venture capital funds in the world, where she focuses on investing in consumer and marketplace startups. Prior to Benchmark, Sarah was the first product manager at Pinterest. And though I normally have a policy against VCs on the podcast, as you'll see, Sarah thinks very much like a product and growth leader. And I always learn a ton talking to Sarah about startups and marketplaces. We also learn in our conversation, she used to play rugby and was apparently one of the best tacklers in her league. 

(00:01:28):
In our conversation, we unpack two of Sarah's killer frameworks for building a startup. One, the hierarchy of engagement, which is an incredibly useful lens for trying to figure out how to grow and scale your consumer startup. And then, the hierarchy of marketplaces, which is an incredibly useful guide for helping you build your marketplace startup.

Sarah, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. 

Sarah Tavel (00:03:12):
Super excited to be here. 

Lenny (00:03:13):
So you may or may not know this, but actually, normally have a policy of no VCs on the podcast. But you're a very special VC because you're a former product manager. Many people don't know you were the first product manager at Pinterest. To me, you still think like a product manager so I'm very excited to break my rule and have you on the podcast. 

Sarah Tavel (00:03:31):
Thank you for the exception. 

Lenny (00:03:33):
What I want to do with our time together is dig into two frameworks that you've developed and use with founders that you work with to help them build successful companies. One is focused around customer businesses, and one marketplace businesses.

(00:03:49):
Let's just start with the first framework. I think you call it the Hierarchy of Engagement. Just to start, could you maybe just share a broad overview of this framework? And also, just where it emerged from, where you came up with this concept? 

Sarah Tavel (00:04:02):
Sure. I think one thing you'll notice about me is that I have an allergic reaction to vanity metrics, what people talk about as vanity metrics. When I made the transition from Pinterest, where I was leading product for the discovery team, so I was responsible for all the discovery surfaces on Pinterest. The home feed, the search, the recommendations, a couple other teams. Ultimately, what those teams were about was about engagement, increasing engagement of Pinterest. It was helping people, when they were on Pinterest, find something that they loved enough that they wanted to pin it to one of their boards.

(00:04:48):
When I started to meet with all these really talented consumer founders building consumer social products, this was during a time when everybody was getting excited about growth hacking. What you would see is that you would see all these founders coming in, and they all had these up and to the right graphs, whether it was sign-ups, or downloads, or MAUs. It felt to me like it wasn't obvious that those metrics that they were all getting very attached, and focused on, and showing in these presentations was the wrong thing to focus on. It didn't get to the heart of whether they were on the path to building enduring consumer social product. They were missing, at the core, the criticality of engagement. 

(00:05:45):
I just started to feel this and it became like a pebble in my shoe. I started just to go through that process that you've gone through many times before of writing and distilling it, and that's where I came up with this hierarchy. What you realize when you look at social products is that they're almost is this action which I call the core action of that product that forms the foundation of the product. When a user completes this action, it's clear that they both understand the utility of the product, they understand what that product is all about, and it's an action that, if they perform the action, they're very likely to come back. So for Facebook, the obvious action is friending, in the beginning days. For Pinterest, it's pinning. I don't know if you're an Evernote user. For Evernote, it's writing a note. When you perform that action, that means you're an engaged user. Of course, there's a lot of other actions that you have to do. You can follow people on Pinterest, you comment on Facebook. But the end of the day, if you're not doing that action, you're not really a user to the product. That's why the MAU thing doesn't really mean anything. It's really looking at, I think, of users completing the core action. You can look at this as a cohort, weekly, daily, whatever the right cadence is. But that's the foundation, that's level one. 

Lenny (00:07:16):
Basically, there's some definition of an active user that a consumer business basically needs to define, and essential figure out what is that action they're taking that makes them an active user versus just opening up the app, or whatever it is. For Snapchat, it might be sending a snap.

Sarah Tavel (00:07:34):
That's right.

Lenny (00:07:35):
For What's App, it might be sending a message. Okay, cool.

Sarah Tavel (00:07:36):
Yes. Yes. By the way, this action, it's very important to pick the right action. You want to make sure it's an action that scales to enough users. You want to think about, "If I think about my product roadmap and optimize for it, what do we end up doing?" 

(00:07:56):
Just to give you a more concrete example, actually in the early days of Pinterest, we weren't sure what it was. We had all these things we were measuring. We were measuring follows, we were measuring clicking through, liking something, pinning obviously, time on site. We would do these experiments and you would get all this different data where some things would go up, some things would go down. What were we optimizing for? 

(00:08:24):
There's something that's really, really important about having that clarity of this is the action that is most important for our product. All things, our NUX has to lead to this. If a user isn't doing this, then there's something missing from their experience of the product. It's super important to get real clarity and know exactly the one that you're going to be picking to go forward. 

Lenny (00:08:49):
One more question along these lines. How do you think about this milestone versus the activation milestone for a new user? Do you find they're often the same? Getting your user to that aha moment-

Sarah Tavel (00:09:00):
Yes. 

Lenny (00:09:00):
Versus ongoing? 

Sarah Tavel (00:09:01):
Right. Part of it is how do you measure the success of your NUX, of the activation? To me, it is are you taking those new users and helping them understand the mental model of your product well enough that they start completing the core action.

Lenny (00:09:18):
Awesome. 

Sarah Tavel (00:09:19):
There was a NUCs once that we played with at Pinterest where we didn't even teach people what pinning was. It was their feed magically appeared and it was a real ... That was an example of okay, we have to help people understand that they are here to discover something and save it to their board. 

Lenny (00:09:35):
Just in case people don't know what NUX is, new user experience. It's just an acronym for new user experience.

Sarah Tavel (00:09:40):
Thank you. Yes.

Lenny (00:09:42):
Okay. Maybe one more just foundational thing that I think we maybe skipped is what's the best way to think about using this framework? Is this essentially where you should focus your energy, on which elements of your product you should be driving, which metrics to focus on? Is that a simple way to think about ... Basically, we've talked about layer one and there's three layers. What's the best way to think about, as you're talking through this framework, of how to apply it and use it? 

Sarah Tavel (00:10:02):
In a way, you have to think holistically when you're building these consumer products, when you're designing it. But I think it's very important, once you get the product out and you're starting to optimize, to start thinking through each of the levels. That's just very focusing, to help a founder understand, "What are the levers that I really have to be focusing on to improve?"

Lenny (00:10:26):
Awesome. I want to come back to how to apply it, in maybe some examples, after we go through the three levels so I'll turn it back to you. 

Sarah Tavel (00:10:32):
Perfect. Let's say you're building your product and you're starting to see that you have users completing the core action. Then, the next challenge you have, and I've seen this many times before, is that then you have to figure out how to get those users to stick around. You want to retain those users. Obviously, if they do the core action once or twice, and then they run out of steam, you're going to be in a really challenged position to build something that endures. 

(00:11:03):
The test for me, of whether you're building a product that has the ingredients to create a retentive product on a micro level, just at the user level, is that the product should get better the more you use it, and you'll have more to lose by leaving it. I'll give you a couple examples there, a couple of my favorite products. 

(00:11:26):
Obviously, Pinterest. One of the features that I worked on when I was at Pinterest and we shipped was this idea of a picked for you feed. The idea was every time you pinned something to a board, we would take that information that the user gave us and use it to create recommendations in their home feed. It may have been the first algorithmic feed that was in a social product because, suddenly your home feed wasn't just things and people that you followed. The truth is, people weren't really following other people on Pinterest so we needed a way to make the experience get better the more you used it, so we started to do these recommendations in your home feed. 

(00:12:10):
It was this experience that, the more you pinned, the more personalized your home feed got for you. Then, the more you pinned, you also had more to lose by leaving Pinterest because, all of a sudden, you had all your favorite books, articles you wanted to remember, the recipes that you were planning on cooking one day, the holiday planning that you were doing. So you wouldn't abandon Pinterest because Pinterest was this repository for these different expressions of your identity, or these different bookmarks that you wanted to back to. That was this idea. It's very important that the core action is the thing that you use as the product to make the experience better over time. 

(00:12:52):
Evernote, another example. I don't know if you're an Evernote user.

Lenny (00:12:57):
No. I tried it once and it was way too complicated, and I gave up quickly.

Sarah Tavel (00:13:01):
People still laugh at me for being an Evernote user.

Lenny (00:13:05):
Oh, wow. 

Sarah Tavel (00:13:06):
I'm a lifetime user. 

Lenny (00:13:09):
Wow. 

Sarah Tavel (00:13:09):
It's one of those things that I take all my notes in Evernote. I dump documents in Evernote. What I means is that, the more I use it ... Now I know that I can do a search in my Evernote and I'm going to find the document I'm looking for. Now, I can never leave Evernote. It has everything. I have thousands and thousands of documents in Evernote. That's a product that's incredibly retentive. 

Lenny (00:13:37):
Unless someone builds a great exporter, and then there goes that piece of friction. 

Sarah Tavel (00:13:41):
People keep telling me I need to move on to Notion or something else, but not yet. I will remain a dinosaur here. 

Lenny (00:13:48):
Wow. I love that that's an example of someone can break that barrier and make it less retentive, by making it easier to get off.

Sarah Tavel (00:13:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:13:56):
It's interesting growth strategy, basically. 

Sarah Tavel (00:13:57):
Yes. Yeah, it's very true. Let's say, now, you have a product, it's growing, more people are completing the core action. When they complete that core action, the product gets more retentive for them. It gets better the more they use it, they have more to lose by leaving it. Then, your tall task, and this is the hardest thing to overcome, is how do you make the product self-perpetuating? This is where I love to think of every time a user users your product, let's say they're clicking on the mouse or they're tapping on their phone, I love to think of it as this kinetic energy that they're putting into your product. You're taking that energy, and your job with a great product, is to take that energy and, as much as possible, convert it back to the experience that they're having with your product. 

(00:14:55):
Now, the biggest thing that you can do is a network effect. The more I pin something on Pinterest, the better the experience for every user on Pinterest. Every time I add a pin to a board, I'm creating a new edge in Pinterest Graph, that Pinterest then uses to create recommendations and enrich their understanding of all those objects on Pinterest. The network effect is the strongest thing that you can do. And obviously, if you have that, which all social products have to in some way, you have to spend time, as much as possible, just maximizing where that shows up, fine-tuning it, removing friction so that it's a flywheel that spins faster and faster. 

(00:15:42):
But, there's other loops too, that you have to identify and then maximize. These are the growth and re-engagement loops. These are classic loops, you talk about these a lot, they exist in marketplaces and social products. How do you get it so that, as your users use the product, they want to share it with other people? They create metadata that you can then use for SEO. You have collaborative experiences that pull other people in. There's all different things you can do here. And then, there's also things that you can do to re-engage a user.

(00:16:18):
As an example, in the early days of Pinterest, if you pinned something, you're pinning something that you found on Pinterest that somebody else pinned. So we would send a push notification, "Hey, Lenny, Sarah just pinned your pin to her art board." Now, if you were a dormant user at that point, it's been a couple weeks since you'd used Pinterest, that notification might pull you back into Pinterest and be like, "Hey, I wonder what other pins Sarah has on her art board." It's a great re-engagement loop where Pinterest doesn't have to do anything there intentional. The user is creating the action that drives the outcome that Pinterest wants in that example. 

(00:17:03):
Now, as much as I love Evernote, this is a place where Evernote obviously falls down. There's no loops that they can take advantage of, that when I use the product, I make it better for you. There's no loop where, when I use the product, I want to pull you into the product. They tried at some point, to do collaborative journals, it doesn't work. That's a place where, because of that, Evernote had to spend money to acquire users, they tapped out. They missed that level three. 

(00:17:38):
There's other examples I could speak to, of companies that weren't able to transcend to level three, that you wouldn't otherwise think. I think of companies like Houseparty and Clubhouse. What was interesting about both of those products is that you would think that the more users that came into Clubhouse or Houseparty, the faster the flywheel should spin. But the challenge was that they relied on push notifications. I don't know if you had this experience, but let's take Houseparty as an example. You started to follow a lot of people on Houseparty, and then all of a sudden, your push notifications just got overwhelming. Because it was a realtime product, that you had to use push noti cations to know the moment to join the product, but when you had so many push notifications because the more people you followed, the more notifications you had, you just get to this point where you start ignoring them. It becomes this thing where, even though the flywheel should be spinning faster, it starts breaking down. That's the real tricky nuance in this level three.

Lenny (00:18:52):
I think people hearing this are going to be like, "Okay, getting people to use your product more often, increase retention, make it viral basically," it's stuff they already know. But I think what's powerful about this is this is just a lens, a clarifying lens on what is most important. There's so many things you can be focusing on to increase your product's success and help it grow. What I love here is just, "Here's the three most important things, and then here's the levels." They build on each other. If you want to increase retention, get people to do the core action more often. If you want to help it grow, focus on helping it spread, self-perpetuate. 

Sarah Tavel (00:19:30):
Yeah, I know. That's absolutely right. The importance of it is I can't emphasize enough how important focus is when you're building these companies. It's so hard. There really isn't a playbook. Every company, the ones that succeed have to be fundamentally different from anything that was before it. But there are these first principles of the ingredients that they all share, and you can use those ingredients to really focus you when you're going through the inevitable growth curve and wanting to know, "Well, how do we maximize this moment? How do we really focus on the things that will set us most up for success?" That's where I think a framework like this can be really clarifying. 

Lenny (00:20:17):
There's a lot of depth behind each of these things that you're being modest about. One is, with the top of this pyramid of making it self-perpetuating, the reason that's really important is for a consumer app to work well most of the time, it has to be able to spread really cheaply. The cost of acquisition needs to be very low, unless you somehow figure out some paid ad strategy where you can make money with paid ads, which is very rare. So maybe speak to why that's so important to a consumer product.

Sarah Tavel (00:20:45):
Yeah. What are you trying to build with a consumer product? You're not trying to build something niche. You want to build something that can be a mass-market, hundreds of millions of users, billions of users. It would take considerable capital to do that with marketing. There's one example that we have so far, which is TikTok, of spending more than $1 billion, once they figured out actually the first two levels in order to grow. They didn't actually put user acquisition spend behind TikTok until they had a product that was retentive, and then they know that they really wanted to maximize that. But every other social product has grown organically. They've been able to do so because they've figured out how to maximize these loops. Even TikTok got to millions over users before they spent all the capital to acquire those remaining users. 

Lenny (00:21:52):
I didn't know that number. TikTok spent $1 billion on paid ads-

Sarah Tavel (00:21:56):
Yes.

Lenny (00:21:56):
To get to where they are today? 

Sarah Tavel (00:21:57):
Yes.

Lenny (00:21:57):
Holy moly. 

Sarah Tavel (00:21:58):
Yes.

Lenny (00:21:59):
I knew it was many millions, but I didn't realize it was $1 billion.

Sarah Tavel (00:22:04):
Yes. 

Lenny (00:22:04):
That just shows you how hard it is to break in and become a new social network, essentially, or a new social app. 

Sarah Tavel (00:22:10):
It is hard. And then, at the same time though, we do see exceptions to it where I still feel like consumers are hungry for new experiences. We've seen a couple over the last few years that have gone into tens of millions of users. Nothing that has really created the experience that's sticky enough to pull minutes away from, really TikTok and Instagram, which just are these dominant forces right now. 

Lenny (00:22:42):
Your message also reminded me of a recent guest post on my newsletter about this app Saturn, I don't know if you read it. 

Sarah Tavel (00:22:49):
Oh, I didn't. But I know of the app, and it's just an awesome founder.

Lenny (00:22:53):
Yeah. It was really interesting. They had a really interesting insight about, first of all, very few apps ever make it to the top of the app store that break through what's already there. The ones that do almost always spend a few days there and then, are gone because it's a one shot thing. What they basically talked about is many apps have this viral K-factor, where they spread like crazy, everyone starts using them, everyone's in there. But then the opposite happens very quickly, too, where if a few people miss using it a few days, you go in there and it's, "Oh, nothing's happening here anymore," and it quickly crumbles. Clubhouse essentially went through this, BeReal started go through this, where people stopped posting and then, "All right, forget this. Everyone's gone." Most apps have this destructive K-factor that kicks in, the same way it kicked in to get it to spread. 

Sarah Tavel (00:23:36):
Yes. As people say, when something grows really quickly, it also can collapse really quickly. 

Lenny (00:23:43):
Yeah. Tough. I guess along those lines, is there anything you've seen or learned ... The idea of this framework is to avoid that, essentially. But I guess, is there anything comes to mind to avoid that? 

Sarah Tavel (00:23:55):
One other thing that I've seen that runs into a challenge, and I find it runs into a challenge particularly with level two, is anonymity. Anonymity is something where ... Pseudo-anonymity and anonymity are very different concepts. With pseudo-anonymity, we have it on Twitter, you have it on Reddit. You have a persistent identity that you're creating, and that identity then can have accruing benefits, mounting loss. My pseudo-anonymous account on Twitter that just flames other VCs ... I'm just kidding.

Lenny (00:23:55):
This is breaking news.

Sarah Tavel (00:24:35):
I'm not funny enough to make something like that. But for the people who do have it, they get accruing benefits because they get people to follow them. And that's the mounting loss too, where they've grown their identity on a platform even though it's a pseudo-anonymous identity. The challenge when you have pure anonymity is that you don't have that accruing benefit or mounting loss that happens. 

(00:25:05):
I don't know if you ever played with Secret, but it's similar to TikTok or something like that. These are the types of experiences where, over time ... The network effect doesn't work because the anonymity creates the conditions for bad behavior, so that starts to pull down the community. And then, it is also the experience where you'd use a product and you can delete, and then come back three months later, and because of the anonymity aspect of it, your experience isn't any different. I find anonymity, people keep trying it, and super talented founders keep hitting their head against that wall because it has the very early fun growth, but it just continues to be a product that isn't able to persist without some persistent identity. 

Lenny (00:26:05):
I'm going to pull on this thread of just ways to increase retention. Basically, this is one of the things, maybe the main thing you're telling people to help increase retention, make it so that it's really hard to leave. Before we get there, just to make it clear, is this framework mostly for social consumer products, or do you generalize it to consumer products? 

Sarah Tavel (00:26:25):
I think it's consumer products in general.

Lenny (00:26:29):
Okay.

Sarah Tavel (00:26:29):
But it makes the most sense for consumer social. 

Lenny (00:26:34):
Okay, got it. 

Sarah Tavel (00:26:34):
It works for Evernote. Evernote isn't a consumer social product. 

Lenny (00:26:39):
Awesome. Okay, so it's most helpful for if you're the social, your friends are in it sort of product?

Sarah Tavel (00:26:45):
Right. You have the chance of level three with social.

Lenny (00:26:48):
Right, awesome. Okay. On this thread of retention, it's a thing that I speak about often, everyone always talks about. The most important thing you got to get right is get retention to a good place because if you can't retain people, nothing's going to work anyway. 

(00:27:02):
So just to spend a little more time here, is there anything else you recommend to founders to help them with increasing retention and getting to a healthy place with retention? 

Sarah Tavel (00:27:13):
Number one is actually measuring it. I can't tell you how many times I suggest to a founder to track cohorts and that's a new thing. Just being really, really clear and intellectually honest on looking at cohorts I think is number one. 

Lenny (00:27:34):
Okay, maybe just describe that briefly, and then we'll link to an article that I have about how to do that. 

Sarah Tavel (00:27:38):
Perfect. These are the moments when I should probably turn the mic over to you, to talk about-

Lenny (00:27:44):
Nope, you're in the hot seat. 

Sarah Tavel (00:27:46):
[inaudible 00:27:46]. A cohort, what I always like to look at is weekly cohorts for these products. You look at them in two ways. Which is one, for each vintage of cohorts, you're looking at a group of people who signed up in a given week, and that's one. 

Sarah Tavel (00:28:00):
... like a group of people who signed up in a given week and that's one cohort. You look at it both on an active user basis, like are those people continuing to come back to the product? And I particularly love to look at that on a weekly active user completing the core action pieces of like, are users completing the core action? How is that changing overtime for each of the cohorts? And then also, looking at activity level within those cohorts. And so, what you love to see is the kind of classic smile graph where, as the network grows and users start to use the product more and more, you start to see that, overtime, they actually become more retained in the product as opposed to kind of the classic leaky bucket where the cohort just keeps on dwindling down. And until you reach a point with your cohorts where there is a plateau, you have more work to do on figuring out the retention of your users.

(00:29:04):
The second thing is just focus. So I can't tell you how how many times also you'll meet a founder and they will... There was one example I saw, it was a kind of a dating app, friend making app, and he was growing it via TikTok, which is not geographically constrained at all. And so, he's growing the user numbers, but without focusing on a specific geography, it's gonna be really difficult to make that type of product a high retention product.

Lenny (00:29:39):
Coming back to the framework, which layer do you find most often is the one founders maybe are under-investing in/maybe the most important to focus on if you had to pick one of these, or is it super dependent on your situation?

Sarah Tavel (00:29:54):
What I often feel is that, a lot of times, product founders, consumer founders, see where they want to get to, they compare themselves to the full expression of a product that you see with other products, ROBLOX, Instagram, TikTok, whatever it may be, and they want to get there.

(00:30:19):
But what that ends up meaning when the when a new user signs up is that there's too much in the beginning to to take in and understand, and you don't then have a very focused product that gets the user to the thing that you most want them to do. And that's actually part of the importance of understanding level one, what your core action is, is that you want to make sure that when a user comes to your product, signs up for the first time, doesn't have necessarily a lot of contacts on what the product is itself, that they see the thing that they're supposed to do and you get them to do it. And a lot of times, in the beginning, there are just so many other things that a product might have that you're defusing that attention that they would otherwise have had on the on the thing that's most important. 

(00:31:19):
And so, I feel that that's the first mistake, and it's kind of natural that it would be the first mistake, but maybe the largest mistake that I see people make. 

Lenny (00:31:32):
Essentially, not getting the activation moment right, not focusing enough on getting people to that aha moment as people describe, and then again, that repeating again and again as a core action. 

Sarah Tavel (00:31:42):
Yes.

Lenny (00:31:43):
To close the loop on this sort of discussion, could you just share again a few examples of core actions/activation moments, just to make this fresh again in people's minds? And then also, just whatever you could share about helping people decide what that is. I know it's a difficult thing to do well, but any advice for how to find that activation?

Sarah Tavel (00:32:03):
I mean, I'll tell you the exercise that we did at Pinterest because as I mentioned before, it wasn't obvious to us in the beginning of Pinterest like were we a social network? Like should we optimize for the follow graph? But you have to remember, Pinterest, this was 2011, you had Twitter growing like crazy, Instagram was growing. Those were both asymmetrical follow graphs that they were creating, right? And so, it wasn't clear at the time whether Pinterest was actually just creating a new follow graph, but that was about things instead of what Twitter was or what Instagram was. And so, it wasn't obvious.

(00:32:45):
And what happened actually is that there was two efforts that I think of as like kind of bottoms-up and top-down that helped really clarify that, actually, pinning something was the core action, it was going to be our North Star. We called it weekly active pinners.

(00:33:03):
And the two things were, there's always this like bottoms-up analysis that you do, which is, we looked at every action that you could do on Pinterest, so we had liking, following, clicking through, time on site, pinning, repinning. And we looked at, first of all, what percentage of users complete those actions? And if you do that action in a week, what's your propensity to come back the following week? And we basically ranked that.

(00:33:38):
And what we saw was that if you pinned something, repinned something, which is finding something on Pinterest, I'm using those synonymously, or click through, you had an incredibly high probability that you would come back. So if someone's pinning something, they're coming back to Pinterest the next week with a super high, more than 90% probability at the time.

(00:34:02):
And then there's like the top-down way of thinking about it, which is, well, what is Pinterest for? And if a user does come to Pinterest and they never add something to a board, do they really understand what Pinterest is? And yes, clicking through makes you want to save it. The click through is valuable, you want save it, so clicking through is obviously really important. But at the end of the day, if they don't like that pin enough that they want to save it themselves to their board, then we haven't done our job. 

(00:34:36):
And so, we did this kind of top down, bottoms up analysis to make it very clear that when we launch an experiment or launch a new feature, if the probability, if the percentage of people that pin something doesn't go up, or the number of pins for that cohort doesn't go up, that experiment is not a a successful experiment.

Lenny (00:34:58):
Awesome. There's a post I'll link to in the show notes where there's actually a guide to doing this regression analysis on how to figure out your activation milestone.

Sarah Tavel (00:34:59):
Amazing.

Lenny (00:35:08):
Basically, what is most causal of retention as you're describing. And I love this example from Pinterest. Any other just examples? Again, you shared a few at the beginning of just examples of great activation milestones/core user actions.

Sarah Tavel (00:35:20):
I'll tell you one other one that I thought was super interesting, which is that when I initially published this post, I had assumed wrongly that YouTube's core action was watching a video. And then Shishir Mehrotra, who was the kind of CPO of YouTube, he reached out to me and he said, "That's what it was in the early days, but we started to realize that it wasn't actually our core action. And we did a lot of analysis on YouTube and what we realized was that subscribing was the core action on YouTube."

(00:35:59):
And it makes so much sense when he said it, right? You're a creator, you're uploading content onto YouTube, there are a lot of other places at that time that you could have uploaded that content to, but you care about YouTube because that's where you're growing your audience, right? And so, the more people that subscribe to your content on YouTube, the more you have the accruing benefits and mounting loss of using YouTube.

(00:36:26):
And so, that was super important on the creator side, which, one of the funny things that will bridge to our next conversation is that all social products are really marketplaces, right? YouTube is a marketplace. You have the creators uploading content and the viewers who are watching it, supply and demand.

(00:36:46):
And so then, the subscribe button is also very interesting because then from the demand side, the viewer, why would I come back to YouTube consistently versus, again, all the other places I could spend time on if it weren't for me having found creators for whom their content really resonates with me so much so that I subscribe to their content? 

(00:37:10):
And so, I loved that example because it showed a little bit the evolution that can happen with these companies, but then also, just the beauty of like you know you've got something really right with the core action when it's helping both sides of your network.

Lenny (00:37:26):
Awesome example. And I think it's also a good reminder people change these things. "You come up with your best bet. Okay, we tried this for six months, maybe let's try something else. We've learned something new."

Sarah Tavel (00:37:36):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:37:37):
I'm also going to link to this post I wrote around finding your North Star metric, which was like such a multimedia conversation with just links for all these topics to go deeper. Essentially, I figured out the North Star metric for, I don't know, 30 companies. And I feel like the North Star metric of a company ends up often being this core user action. So like Pinterest, it sounds like those WAPs, weekly active pinners.

Sarah Tavel (00:38:00):
Yeah. Pinners, yeah.

Lenny (00:38:01):
And YouTube is subscribers.

Sarah Tavel (00:38:04):
In the beginning we called it weekly active repinners and war because we felt like we were at war, so it was good.

Lenny (00:38:09):
And then, it became peacetime maybe.

Sarah Tavel (00:38:10):
Yes, exactly. 

Lenny (00:38:11):
Awesome.  So maybe just to close the thread on this framework, can you just briefly summarize who this is most helpful for and just how they could apply it if they're maybe not growing as fast as they want or they're just getting started as a founder building a consumer product?

Sarah Tavel (00:38:29):
Yeah, I think about consumer founders, product founders, product leaders in these companies that are thinking through the road map. What is the most important things that they need to prioritize, the big rocks, for the immediate short-term? And the framework then provides a lens on what to prioritize.

Lenny (00:38:51):
And we'll link to the whole framework for people that want to go deeper.

Sarah Tavel (00:38:54):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:38:54):
Okay, so let's move on to your second framework that you called the hierarchy of marketplaces. And first of all, I want to give a shout-out to Mike Williams, who's the founder of Everything Marketplaces, who gave me a bunch of good question suggestions to ask as we do this.

Sarah Tavel (00:39:07):
Wonderful, now I'm nervous. 

Lenny (00:39:10):
He's Mr. Marketplace.

Sarah Tavel (00:39:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:39:12):
Okay, so let's start with the same question, just what's kind of the broad way to think about what this framework is and who it's for? And then, where did it come from?

Sarah Tavel (00:39:18):
It's a framework or hierarchy that is for marketplace founders. It could actually be B2BC or B2C, or marketplace product leaders that are like either getting started or scaling their marketplace and helping kind of prioritize and focus on the things that most matter.

(00:39:42):
And it came out of a similar reaction, a very similar parallel to what I was experiencing, meaning, all these consumer social founders. Like they would talk about MAUs and I just felt like it didn't get to the heart of whether they were building enduring value. And I actually started to realize that GMV was very similar. GMV, it's a metric that it seems like... Of course, you can't build a marketplace without growing GMV in the same way that you can't build a social product without growing MAUs. But if you focus, if the race that you think you're running is to grow MAUs or to grow GMV, you're not actually going to run the right race. It can take you... 

(00:40:32):
And actually, with marketplace, very interestingly, it can take you in the wrong direction. So what would happen is I would meet all these founders and everybody got fixated on this milestone of $1,000,000 of GMV. Right. And I think a lot of people started to feel like if you could hit $1,000,000 of annualized GMV, it means you're ready for your Series A. But it's kind of self-evident that not all GMV is created equal, right?

(00:41:02):
So imagine a food delivery company 10 years ago. You could have $1,000,000 of GMV by focusing on LA, or $1,000,000 of GMV by focusing on Boston, or you could have $1,000,000 of GMV by having $500,000 here, $200,000 here, like spreading it out. And I would meet so many founders who would say, " Oh, well, I thought we had to prove out that the value proposition resonated in these other cities and so, that's why we're diffusing our focus." But what they what I would always feel is like they were just making their job so much harder by doing that.

(00:41:46):
The other way you could think of it is like if you're trying to get to $1,000,000 of GMV as quickly as possible, you're actually motivated to go after a really big market, right? It's a lot easier to get to $1,000,000 of GMV when you're skimming the cream on this big ocean of a market, then to be very, very focused on a smaller market. And getting to $1,000,000 of GMV in a constrained market is a lot harder, takes longer, but it's actually the path to building something that endures.

(00:42:16):
And so, I was having the same conversation again and again and I just felt like I needed to crystallize it or synthesize it in a way that would be easier to communicate, and that's what led to this hierarchy.

Lenny (00:42:30):
Awesome. Okay, cool. So you've touched on a number of the important elements of this hierarchy, so let's dive in.

Sarah Tavel (00:42:35):
Okay. There's probably a couple core insights, but the first one that I think about with this hierarchy is that when you're building a marketplace, you actually have to start from the goal and work backwards from there.

(00:42:51):
Now, what's the goal? Marketplaces, I mean, you have so much incredible content on this, they're just incredibly difficult to build. You're basically building two companies at the same time, right? You have the product and go-to-market org for the demand side, the product and go-to-market org for the supply side. And somehow, you have to make these two line up so that they serve each other's needs. It's an incredibly difficult dance. And yeah, it's one of the hardest types of companies in the software world that I think you can build.

(00:43:29):
And you do it because you think about the the full expression of these models and you think about companies like Airbnb or Amazon or eBay or Google, where once you have scale and have very dominant market share, you have a product that just is the best place without question of fulfilling this need. And they end up being very profitable cash-flowing businesses. And you see that, and that's the business that you want to build, that's why you're going through all the hardship of building a marketplace, getting the marketplace off the ground to get to that place.

(00:44:10):
And there's kind of very clear analysis. I published it in the hierarchy. I have this incredible graph that I remember seeing when I board observer for this online classified company called OLX led by Fabrice Grinda. And it kind of shows that the more dominant a marketplace is relative to the number two in its space, the more profitable that business is. And so, it's just like a very clear like you don't want to be... Obviously, when you're building a marketplace, you don't want to be in the middle of the pack, but even being number one but just barely number one doesn't give you any of the benefits of a marketplace model, you're fighting for each incremental point of market share. It's not clear to the supply side or the demand side that you're like the main place to be. And so, it only becomes really clear once you have that dominant market position where you're just so much bigger than the number two

(00:45:09):
And the only way to get to that place, to get to that moment of real dominance where you have this winner take most dynamic is that you have to tip your market, and that's the only scalable way to do that, and that's what level two is.

(00:45:26):
And so, how do you maximize your chance of tipping a market? You have to focus on a really constrained opportunity, and that is level one. So that's kind of like the broad framing, which is like a really important thing of how, when you're building a marketplace, you actually are building towards that point of dominance. And so, it's part of the reason why being really, really, really focused in level one is so important.

Lenny (00:45:57):
Awesome. So you walked through this backwards. Just to summarize in case people didn't totally catch it, basically, layer one is focus, layer two, tip the market, layer three, dominate the market.

Sarah Tavel (00:46:08):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:46:09):
Awesome.  So let's maybe start with layer one of just focus-

Sarah Tavel (00:46:09):
Let's do it.

Lenny (00:46:13):
... which I think is the most counterintuitive step for people building a marketplace where, as you said, normally, it's go big as fast as possible, get as much GMV as possible, just make everyone happy as quickly as you can. And your advice is, essentially, do the opposite. Make it very...

(00:46:29):
You have this like great acronym of thimble that, I imagine, you'll talk about that I love, I always think about. So yeah.

Sarah Tavel (00:46:34):
Yeah. And part of what's so hard about this idea focus is I'm lucky to meet with just incredibly ambitious founders. And the hardest thing I think about building these marketplaces is that the ambition can often feel like this sun, like the heat of the sun that's trying to warm everything up, and you're going after this big market, warming the ocean.

(00:47:05):
And I think that, really, what the the best, ambitious founders do is they focus that ambition like a laser beam on a small market, the thimble. And what you do is like you're getting that thimble, you're getting the product market fit really, really right with this like small, constrained market. And if you heat that up really, really hot, then it expands from there. 

(00:47:29):
And part of this is that we have to accept a couple of points of scarcity. One is that, you can't raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the start, where we, especially today, live in a world where there is a constraint around capital. And so, you have to be able to take that capital in the beginning and make the most out of it. And the only way to do that is to be very, very focused.

(00:47:57):
And the second thing is that the constraint is the founder's attention. And again, these things are really, really difficult to to get off the ground, and the only way that you can do it is by having myopic focus on a segment.

(00:48:13):
And the example that I always think about was a very cool thing that we all got to see, which is when the food delivery wars happened, where you had companies like DoorDash and Postmates and Uber Eats, and then, the incumbents of Grubhub, take very different strategies. I make comparisons to Postmates and and DoorDash, both successful companies, but Postmates, from the very beginning, had very big ambition and went after all the big cities. They went after, not just restaurants, but restaurants and Apple and retail, bicycle. I remember, there were so many things that they went after all at the same time.

(00:49:06):
And when you're playing that game, you're always being compared to whatever other substitutes there are in the market, right. And you're it and that just when you have constraint of capital and attention you're you're spreading yourself thin across a lot of different vectors of kind of preference for the customer and the seller.

(00:49:28):
DoorDash on the other hand, famously and very controversially went after the suburbs in the beginning. And the beautiful thing about the suburbs is that there is very little competition because no one thought that you could do it economically. And they probably weren't wrong in the beginning, like DoorDash lost a lot of money in the beginning fulfilling delivery in the suburbs, just because the delivery times, the driving was so long, but by going after a market that other people weren't focused on, it let them get to a place where they were able to really make the customers on both sides of their marketplace happy enough that they retained.

(00:50:11):
And this word happy I use, I should expand on it a little bit because the realization I had as I reflected on this kind of feeling that GMV is really actually a vanity metric, it doesn't get at the core of whether you're building enduring value. It's like very clear and there's plenty of examples I could give where there are companies that had incredible scale and still were disrupted by a startup. And it's because actually, customers don't care how big you are, they don't care how many transactions you've accumulated. What they care about is when they have a transaction with you, how happy do you make them? How much better is the experience that you provide than any other substitute that they could use? And if you do a good job, then they're gonna keep coming back to you. And so I call it happy GMV.

(00:51:11):
And that's actually the thing that I think you as a founder or product leader have to focus on, which is, what do I think is going to be the experience of a buyer or seller that leads them to retaining and tracking that as like the happy path and therefore, the happy GMV.

Lenny (00:51:29):
Amazing. I love that concept, happy GMV. You also kind of extend this idea and I think you call it the minimum viable happiness is what you want to create when you're building this marketplace, this symbol of water that you're trying to boil into something incredible. What's the minimum version of that that creates really happy customers?

Sarah Tavel (00:51:52):
That's right.  Yes. And kind of the way to think of it is like, obviously, when you're a marketplace founder you know that in order to build something endures, you're going to have to grow. But you in the beginning, you're you're doing all these things that don't scale, you're working on your product experience, you're taking friction out of the transaction, and you want to get to a point where there's a certain percentage of people that retain after having done a transaction. And so, you're kind of doing the work, doing the work, doing the work to get to that minimum threshold. And that's when you know you get to kind of go to the next step of starting to figure out the levers to really scale what you're doing.

Lenny (00:52:36):
Awesome.  And again, it's easy to say, it's difficult to do as a founder to tell them like, "You just need to get a small version of this marketplace working, versus you go big really quickly." And so, most of the time, I think it's actually like location, basically start in a city if it's location-oriented. Or if it's all online, pick like one niche to focus on, like Etsy was like, craft fair goods, right?

Sarah Tavel (00:53:02):
Exactly. And sometimes, as we saw with Postmates, sometimes it's both, which is, geography and category. Again, you have to assume scarcity of your capital, of your attention, of your customers attention and so getting complete clarity of what is the experience that you want to really nail, what's that happy path you're optimizing for, constraining that in the beginning gives you the option, the optionality to grow beyond that, but if you don't constrain, you just won't be able to get there fast enough.

(00:54:47):
I want to talk about what it looks like when you you've got it working and it makes sense to start expanding, but before I do, there's one kind of example I found in my research which is really interesting, which is Thumbtack where they, from the beginning, went national and across many categories. And the founders admit maybe that wasn't the right idea. It took them a long time to get to something that was really working. But on the other hand, their thinking was to create enough of a flywheel for people to keep coming back. How often do you need a plumber? How often do you need a DJ? So there's-

Sarah Tavel (00:55:22):
I was just going to say that is the trickiness with Thumbtacks model and it persists as the trickiness with their model, which is that you don't have a high repeat use case there and so you have to... One of the really important things with building a marketplace is cornering the buy side, like having a relationship with the buy side where they don't even think about where they're gonna go, they come to you. And if it's a plumber, you use that so infrequently that every time you are going to look for a plumber, you're gonna start at Google, right? You're not gonna assume, "I'm gonna go to Thumbtack to find that because-

Sarah Tavel (00:56:00):
I'm not going to assume I'm going to go to Thumbtack to find that because you've already forgotten by that point. And so you need to have enough touch points with the consumer so that they'll have a relationship with you and start to think of you as a place to go to. And that's probably, that was the trickiness with Thumbtack. And by the way, when we talk through level two, that also level two will articulate some more of that trickiness.

Lenny (00:56:27):
Awesome. By the way, I do use Thumbtack. It's implanted in my head of that's where to go to find plumbers and stuff.

Sarah Tavel (00:56:32):
That's great. I mean those founders, I adore Marco. He is an incredible, incredible founder.

Lenny (00:56:38):
As a segue to layer two, what are signs that you've done a good job at focusing and things are working? You have this term that I love of creating a white hot center, so maybe speak to that, or just what tells you, it's like, "Cool, I think we've got this very focused thimble. How do we know it's time to go?"

Sarah Tavel (00:56:57):
Yeah, I think it's very much that you see people retaining. You just feel that where people are texting you or emailing or whatever it is, that they've had a great experience and you see them coming back. And you're not going to make everybody happy. Let's all accept that. But there's a core of users, a persona that you are able to make really happy. That's when you know that you're on the right track.

Lenny (00:57:29):
Awesome. It's essentially the very fuzzy product market fit question.

Sarah Tavel (00:57:33):
Yes, yeah.

Lenny (00:57:33):
And I'll link to a few posts I've written that help people get there. I guess is there anything you want to add there like this?

Sarah Tavel (00:57:39):
The only thing I'll add, those two things related I'll add. I don't like NPS for this, and I have a whole blog post on this. I like Sean Ellis's question of how disappointed would you be if this product disappeared? And I think it's if you have at least 40% of people respond that they'd be very disappointed, then you're on the right track. That's kind of the feeling that should tell you you're on the right track.

Lenny (00:58:06):
Awesome. Okay, let's talk about layer two around tipping the marketplace.

Sarah Tavel (00:58:10):
So layer two, I think, will actually illuminate again the importance of that constrained focus for layer one. You're doing all these things that don't scale, that you've written so much about, Lenny, about kick-starting, the marketplace, all those things that you can't just keep on doing forever.

(00:58:29):
Now, layer two, level two is about figuring out how to do things that do scale. And really, you're doing it in service of this kind of mythical moment of a tipping point. And the tipping point is this idea that you often reach some kind of saturation point in a market. You've reached an experience, you've kept on working on the product experience, you've taken a lot of friction out, and you keep on growing, growing, growing. And you're doing that in service of increasing happiness.

(00:59:06):
And this is a really important thing. The growth that you're doing, you should have a lot of clarity on your flywheel at this point, and know that you're growing in service of accelerating your flywheel. And people talk about the flywheel as liquidity. You could think of it as happiness, which is that the more the flywheel spins, the more you're able to make both sides of your marketplace happy.

(00:59:33):
And what you're doing is you're growing into a greater percentage of your market. And as you're doing all these things again that don't scale, then you reach this moment where things start to get a lot easier. You've kind of pushed the boulder up the hill and it starts to slide down. And what you notice first, I think, is you start to see it on a micro level where you might have suppliers that start to tip to you or buyers that tip. You might see your cohorts get a little bit better. You start to see some organic growth.

(01:00:06):
And let me give a story or an example of a company that I got to see where the marketplace started to tip. So we're investors in a company called REKKI. And REKKI is a marketplace for restaurants and their suppliers. And it's, imagine in the beginning, this kind of app that you could use. It almost looked like WhatsApp, that a chef could use instead of doing a voicemail at midnight when they're leaving the restaurant or typing something into WhatsApp and texting it to their supplier, an email, whatever it is. They could use this REKKI app and it would make it a lot easier for them to do that. And then of course the marketplace elements is that then they'll be able to discover other suppliers on REKKI if they need them.

(01:00:57):
Now in the beginning, REKKI had to have their own sales force and they were going to London, knocking on the doors of these restaurants, finding and cornering probably the chef in the kitchen to show them the app, to get them to change to this new app called REKKI. And it's a very high cost of sales effort to have, as you might imagine. But then what started to happen is that every time they got a new chef onto REKKI, that order would then go to the supplier that that restaurant normally ordered from. And so instead of getting the voicemail, the supplier would start to see a nice order form that was from the restaurant and provided by REKKI, powered by REKKI.

(01:01:43):
And what would happen is that as REKKI grew more and more in London, these suppliers started to get more and more of their restaurants ordering via REKKI. And then some of the early suppliers started to be like, "Well, this is so much easier for me. I would much rather get this order form from REKKI than have to listen to an hour of voicemails from chefs with different accents and different ways of ordering their food in the morning when I come in.

(01:02:12):
And so then the suppliers would reach out to REKKI and be like, "Hey, here's a CSV of all of our customers. Can you reach out to them and onboard them to REKKI because I'd much rather have my orders come via REKKI than the way I'm getting them." And so you go from this moment of the hard high cost of sales, pounding the pavement, to getting a list on a silver platter of restaurants to onboard. And that's that feeling of tipping, where all of a sudden something goes from being really freaking hard to so much easier.

Lenny (01:02:52):
It feels a lot like how people describe finding product market fit. Things start to feel like you're not pushing anymore and it's just coming to you.

Sarah Tavel (01:03:00):
Yes.

Lenny (01:03:01):
In your experience, is this tipping often just happens as you become more successful in this thimble of a marketplace? Or is it things you have to do actively to tip to get to this place? It sounds like in REKKI it was like this feature they built of just recommending, "Hey, you should check out REKKI, and maybe other suppliers would help you have an easier time if they're joining." So is it usually like it just happens with scale, or is there usually something you have to change to create this tipping point?

Sarah Tavel (01:03:32):
I don't think Ronan predicted that that was what was going to happen. And you're constant, that kind of customer obsession, having the relationships with the suppliers, having the relationship with the buyers, so that you have your ear to the ground. And when they start to lean in a little bit, you're there to receive them. And so I think this is very much part of what great marketplace founders are able to do, is they're able to start to feel that there's something tipping in their direction and then create momentum behind it.

(01:04:10):
And that's a lot of what this level two is all about, which is that, I think, every marketplace has to figure out what I call tipping loops. And there's two types of tipping loops that work together symbiotically to help a marketplace scale.

(01:04:28):
The first are the growth loops. And so we just talked about an example with REKKI. There are many examples of this Hipcamp, another marketplace I'm lucky to work with. If you and I went camping on Hipcamp and I booked a tree house on Hipcamp, and you are going to join me on it, I could then as part of my checkout flow, essentially invite you to my reservation so that you could see the maps, the more information about the tree house and any of the sites around it. And so I'm the person that Hipcamp acquired, but then I pull you into my experience and that's a great buyer to buyer growth loop.

(01:05:12):
There's classic seller to seller loops or buyer to seller, all these directions. And then the great marketplaces see those loops and they figure out ways to accelerate them. So classic seller to seller referrals. Uber drivers would tell their friend, "Oh, you should start driving for Uber, it's great." But then Uber incentivize it with a referral bonus, and you started to see Uber drivers literally writing blog posts about how much they loved driving for Uber because some of them were making more money getting the referral bonus then actually driving. And so you're trying to find these growth loops and you maximize them.

Lenny (01:05:56):
Awesome. I'll link to a post that has a lot of these insights from this work that I've done on marketplaces, but a few others that are just interesting. Basically you're trying to figure out how do you create a engine that continues to drive supply and also drives demand. So a fun example is when Etsy was getting started, as you know, they went to craft fairs and pitched sellers, "Hey, sign up for Etsy. You could sell your stuff online." And then all their sellers started telling all their buyers, "Hey, buy my stuff on Etsy."

Sarah Tavel (01:06:24):
Etsy literally gave them business cards. So Etsy gave their sellers business cards that made them feel like, "Oh, I'm a real..." Made them feel professional. And the link on it was to their Etsy store.

Lenny (01:06:39):
I love that. One of the most magical growth engines of marketplaces is when your supply brings on the demand. So that's a really good example. Another one is DoorDash, where basically a restaurant signed up for DoorDash and then they tell all the customers, "You want to order our food? Go to DoorDash and order it." And so all the restaurants are telling everyone about DoorDash and then they become DoorDash users and they order from other restaurants.

Sarah Tavel (01:07:01):
Yes, and it shows how creative DoorDash was to both sides of the market in that example.

Lenny (01:07:08):
And then Faire is an awesome example too. It sounds similar to REKKI as you described, where Faire is basically a B2B artisanal items marketplace where boutique shops buy nice candles and blankets for their store to sell. And essentially they did what you described, where they signed on a store and they basically told them, "All your vendors can join for free and not have to pay any fees if they sign up for Faire, and it makes it easy for you to buy their stuff." And then on the other side, a candlemaker tells all the places they sell to, "Hey, you should use Faire. It's so easy to buy our stuff, and we can communicate through there." And they can sign up without any fees. So basically everyone just invites all their existing partners on Faire, and then everyone's on Faire. So yeah, there's a lot of ways to do it.

Sarah Tavel (01:07:53):
I love it. And so the second type of loop, and again this loop works symbiotically with the growth loop, is what I call happiness loops. And I think of them almost as the kidneys for your marketplace as you grow. The happiness loop, the idea is you have a lot of new sellers coming in, and of course you have new buyers, but you want to make sure that you are matching your buyers with the sellers that are going to give them the best experience.

(01:08:23):
And so, normally in a consumer social product, churn is heartbreaking. Once a user churns, they're almost never going to come back. And with a consumer social product, you're trying to get to massive scale. But when you're building a marketplace, actually, there's a healthy amount of churn that you want on the supplier side because there are just going to be suppliers who aren't going to create a great experience for the buyer, and you can't do anything about that.

(01:08:53):
And so we've all had the Uber driver who you give one star to. That person you don't want on your marketplace getting matched with buyers. And so you're trying to then make sure that, as you grow, you have a natural mechanism in your marketplace to reward the suppliers that you want to reward and to churn out the ones that you don't. Of course your job is to do your best to set all the sellers up for success, but it's an inevitability.

(01:09:24):
And so there's two great examples I think of in these happiness loops, which is around search ranking, and then reputation. Search ranking is just a very obvious one, which is, you're trying to understand what creates a happy experience for the buy side, and then reward the sellers that provide that experience.

(01:09:47):
So I think an interesting example that ended up actually changing but still is illustrative, is that UberEats in the very beginning of their journey, thought that their advantage in the market was going to be about having really fast delivery, right? Because they already had this network of drivers and so they thought that that's where they were going to really lean in and have an edge over any competition. And so in the search ranking, they rewarded restaurants that prepared the food quickly, and so answered the Uber Eats request, and then actually got the food out as fast as possible so that Uber Eats became synonymous with the quickness by which you got the delivery. And so that restaurant that takes 40 minutes to prepare the food, they would get ranked low in the experience for Uber Eats, even if the food was really, really great.

Lenny (01:10:45):
Okay, so we've been talking about tipping of the marketplace. Is there anything else there that you want to share before we move on to the third layer?

Sarah Tavel (01:10:53):
Yeah, there's two other things that come to mind. One, just as a reminder, and then one as a caution. So the reminder is in order to tip a market, you have to reach a saturation point in that market. You can't tip a market before you've penetrated it to some saturation level. And it goes back to level one of why you want to focus on a constrained market.

(01:11:23):
Let's take growing a food delivery product in Des Moines, Iowa versus LA or New York. When you're growing in a small city and you're focused on restaurants, you're going to be able to get to this tipping point a lot faster and more efficiently than if you're going after a very big market. And so there's a real advantage to being able to prove out the playbook as quickly as possible and as efficiently as possible before you move on to bigger challenges. And so I think it underscores, again, why it's so valuable in the beginning to focus on something that is constrained.

(01:12:09):
And again, Postmates focusing on San Francisco, the city. DoorDash focusing initially on the suburbs, much smaller opportunity, but one that they could really knock the cover off the ball on. They had no competition. They had a customer that was desperate for attention, and so they could make them happy. And that just sets you up for real success to go from strength to the adjacent market.

(01:12:38):
The second thing that I'd say is, and this is so important is that not all markets are susceptible to tipping, right? We've all experienced this, I'm sure Lenny, with the companies that you work with, the companies I work with, where there are conditions of a market that make it vulnerable to tipping. I have six in my post just to name a couple classic ones.

(01:13:11):
The first obvious one is just concentration on the supply side. In order to be able to tip a market, you need suppliers to want to lean in on your marketplace. My partner, Bill Gurley talks about how great marketplaces create the new incumbents. So you basically have suppliers who aren't the incumbents. The incumbents aren't going to lean in on your marketplace, they're already fat and happy, but you want to have these hungry suppliers who lean in. But if there's already concentration in your marketplace, in the ecosystem, the market that you're playing in, then you're not going to have sellers lean in, and you're not going to be able to create a flywheel that spins where the more sellers you bring on, the better the pricing or experiences on the demand side because the sellers are happy and there's nobody that's hungry or fighting. And so that's just a critical, critical point.

Lenny (01:14:14):
Bill Gurley and I actually had a little Twitter debate once about supply versus demand and which one's more important. And basically his pitch was like, "All that really matters in the end, to build a successful marketplace, is can you find the demand? Can you bring the demand to your marketplace?" It makes all the sense in the world. Everything in the end is, "Can you find customers?"

(01:14:34):
In the work I've done looking into marketplaces, what I find is the hardest thing to do, to bring people to your marketplace, is to find the supply and bring it to people, basically aggregate it. And your point here is exactly right, is that basically the value of your marketplace is to find this non-concentrated demand that's all over the place and bring it together and make it easy to transact with. So I think that is really important, just to double down on this point, that what makes the marketplace valuable is supply that is hard to find that you make easy to find and transact with. And I feel like that's almost the core of what makes marketplace work.

Sarah Tavel (01:15:13):
I think you're both right.

Lenny (01:15:14):
Yeah, I think we're both right. Right, right.

Sarah Tavel (01:15:15):
Because in the beginning, the only way you get started with the marketplace, obviously, is you're bringing the supply online, and that's what opens up the opportunity. And the only way then for you to have a chance at tipping the market is if there's enough fragmentation on the supply side to create a differentiated experience for the demand side to care about your marketplace. But the only way to build long-term enduring value with a marketplace is to corner the demand side. And so it's kind of a little bit that evolution of a marketplace that ends up changing who you focus on.

(01:15:55):
And I don't know if you've experienced this in my experience with the marketplaces that I work with, it's a constant like, "I have to focus more on the demand side right now. Okay, now we got to focus more on the supply side." And it's just back to how difficult these businesses are to build, especially when you have limited resources, that it's like the forever battle of building a marketplace.

Lenny (01:16:15):
Yeah, especially if it's a geographically oriented marketplace like a DoorDash. Sometimes you have more customers than restaurants.

Sarah Tavel (01:16:15):
Right.

Lenny (01:16:22):
Sometimes you have too many restaurants, not enough customers.

Sarah Tavel (01:16:23):
Yes.

Lenny (01:16:24):
So, it's very city dependent. At Airbnb we had basically many attempts at a dashboard of which market is supply constrained, which is demand constrained. Along the same lines, I think it's also something I think about with B2B marketplaces, the reason they're challenging, in my experience, to work, there's so few of them, is the supply is rarely fragmented. Usually there are very few suppliers, so it's pretty easy. "I'm just going to pick one of these 10 and I don't need you." Is that true? Is that how you think about the challenges of B2B marketplaces?

Sarah Tavel (01:16:53):
There's definitely that, but I think actually the bigger challenge with B2B marketplaces is on the homogeneity of the supply. When you think about a lot of labor marketplaces, and let's take a classic example of Mechanical Turk, right? What you need in a marketplace for that flywheel... I have a graph in my slides where you show that the more you penetrate the market, the happier you're able to make your customer. You should have an exponential experience where the flywheel doesn't slow down. Now you take Airbnb as an example, there isn't a limit to how valuable it is to have more supply on Airbnb because everybody has their own special preferences. And there probably is a theoretical limit, but you just feel like there is always going to be the, there's such heterogeneity in the supply for Airbnb, that that's what has let Airbnb really close and escape competition.

(01:18:04):
With B2B marketplaces what sometimes happens, like a labor marketplace, is that you have this homogeneity in the supply, where it's not clear that adding the next incremental unit of supply actually changes the experience for the demand side. And so at Mechanical Turk, whether Mechanical Turk has a hundred thousand Turkers or 5 million Turkers, it probably doesn't really change the experience for somebody who is using Mechanical Turk. And that's why in the early days, a Mechanical Turk, you saw a lot of other copycats or clones of Mechanical Turk doing something similar because it didn't take that much supply for them to be able to create an experience for a segment of the market that was as good as the already scaled Mechanical Turk.

Lenny (01:18:55):
Awesome. I'm glad we got into that. We're getting real dirty about marketplaces. Exactly what I was hoping for. You said that you had something else you wanted to share along these lines.

Sarah Tavel (01:19:04):
And there's so many other examples of reasons why a marketplace won't tip competition. Again, you're a food delivery company and you go after the suburbs where there's no competition. That makes your job really easy to tip the market. You go to New York City where you have an entrenched competitor of Grubhub plus Seamless Web, a different culture around delivery where the restaurants mostly have their own delivery fleets, and it's just going to be so much harder for you to tip that market. And so, I think you have to be really context aware when you're building a marketplace of what your competition's going to be so that you see if there is a path for you to actually tip the market.

Lenny (01:19:52):
And even if you've tipped the market, it may get untipped, like Uber comes in and starts to eat your lunch, no pun intended. It doesn't last forever. You have to keep fighting for it.

Sarah Tavel (01:20:01):
Well, and it's such an important point, which is that you can never rest on your laurels when you're building a marketplace. The history of places is one in which you have a marketplace that feels dominant and then gets disrupted by a competitor. HomeAway, VRBO being disrupted by the likes of you at Airbnb.

Lenny (01:20:23):
I wish I could take credit for all that. Yeah, so one way I think about it is you're talking about this idea of tipping is, a simple way to think about if tipping is happening, if you're tipping it successfully, is percentage of your growth that's starting to come from organic word of mouth, people just becoming like, "This is the default way I'm going to order food, travel, book a ride."

Sarah Tavel (01:20:43):
I think you see two things. You see one, the cohorts getting better. So people start using you more. As the supply side gets more diverse, you have more and more use cases that you start to be able to serve. And so you get the demand side leaning in more, the cohorts get better. And then to your point, you have the organic growth that happens where you don't have to fight to get each new participant on both sides of your market. There's something that starts to happen where the value proposition is just so strong relative to any other substitute that the market starts coming to you.

Lenny (01:21:27):
Awesome. So essentially, cohort retention starts going up because more and more valuable, and more people are coming to you, just word of mouth or through some loops that you built.

Sarah Tavel (01:21:36):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:21:37):
Awesome. Anything else on this layer/level of the [inaudible 01:21:41] before?

Sarah Tavel (01:21:41):
No.

Lenny (01:21:42):
Okay, cool. Let's talk about dominating the marketplace and what that looks like, and how you do that. How do you dominate a marketplace and win, Sarah Tavel?

Sarah Tavel (01:21:51):
So yes, level three, and this is the one I feel like every founder who starts a marketplace, they're chomping at the bit to be able to really focus now on growth. Because all along, I feel like we've been holding you back of just, "Focus, focus, focus." And what you're doing through level one and level two as you're honing what you're building, is that you're basically building a playbook. You don't yet know whether this playbook is repeatable. It's not always the case that the dynamics of one market is the same elsewhere. I'll take REKKI as an example. In the London food scene, there's significant fragmentation of suppliers. In the Berlin food scene, that's not the case. And so it's not always the case that whatever you did in one market works in another market, but usually there's something that rhymes. There's a hint of what is going to work.

(01:22:56):
So what happens now is you have a market that's tipping, and the question then is, are you ready to take your eye off the ball and start to diffuse your focus into other markets? So there's kind of three vectors then that any marketplace can grow at this point.

(01:23:17):
The first vector is within the existing market where you already are tipping that market. You as a founder then have to make a very personal decision, that what you're looking at is the context of your competitive situation. So if you're tipping a market and you have no other competitor going after that market, you're the first one to see this opportunity, then I think you have two things that you want to do at the same time to grow.

(01:23:49):
The first thing is that you want to take the existing market that you're in and you just keep doing what you're doing, and you may even find ways to stretch beyond that initial market that you're going after-

Sarah Tavel (01:24:00):
... Beyond that initial market that you're going after, within the same market. And so, what I mean by that is Uber went from black cars to UberX to UberPool. They kept on finding ways in the geographies where they were already dominant to keep on getting stronger by expanding the use cases that they serve. So you have continuing to grow and penetrate the market, find ways to answer more use cases in that market that you can do, especially if you don't have a lot of competition. And then, the third vector of growth is you want to then try to get as many plates spinning in as many markets that you can handle as quickly as possible. And this is like the blitz scale, right? This is the land grab. And again, your equity value that you're going to create is going to come from dominating the market.

(01:24:59):
And so you don't want to plant a thousand flags in a thousand markets at the same time, spread yourself too thin, and not decidedly win any one market. You always want to put more wood behind fewer arrows. The more scale that you have, the more cities or categories where you have the flywheel starting to spin and you're starting to see the tipping point happen, the stronger your company will be. Each market that you get, you have scale in, where you'll have contribution profit. You take that contribution profit, you invest it in new markets. The more markets and contribution profit you have, the more venture capital you'll be able to raise, which you then reinvest in growing. And so, this is really the place where you are, as aggressively as possible, while, at the same time, not losing sight of the fact that your goal is, in each market individually, to dominate that market, you're trying to grow into as much possible market opportunity as you possibly can.

Lenny (01:26:10):
And again, the reason this is so important is most founders that are ambitious start with this. They're just like, "Go big immediately, blitz scale. We need to win fast before anyone catches up." And so, again, it's a reminder that's the final step, once you've done these other two steps.

Sarah Tavel (01:26:27):
Yes, and it's such an important point, because don't forget, you're always going to be vulnerable to competition. And so, let's say you have a million dollars, and you spread that million dollars of go-to-market costs across 10 cities, spreading yourself really thin. You have a competitor come in, and guess what? They put a million dollars into one city, they're going to win that city, and that's going to set them up for greater success down the road, to keep on being able to get more capital and more expense that they can put to work to grow those cities. And of course, we never have one competitor. Always have a lot of competitors. And so, focus on these steps is just, it really is such an important thing to have discipline around.

Lenny (01:27:17):
And this is the reason that Uber went big and raised so much money, invested so much to scale so fast, versus Lyft. Same with DoorDash versus Uber. Basically, they're both trying to dominate. Neither one, I guess, Uber, I don't know if it's safe to say, seems to have won in the market. DoorDash versus Uber Eats still very one and two-ish. So I think a lot of people look at these companies, they're like, "They raise so much money, they're losing so much money, they're never going to work." But they do this, because to build a durable business and to get the benefits of the idea of what the marketplace they built, they need to dominate, they need to be number one by far. And it doesn't mean it always works. DoorDash, even though they're bigger than Uber Eats, from what I understand, they're not like... I don't know, would you consider they're dominant? Or is it still a big challenge?

Sarah Tavel (01:28:06):
I don't know. I don't know. What is clear is that they've built an incredible company. It's just an incredible... They've done an incredible job of doing what they do, and it is a crowded market still.

Lenny (01:28:21):
So you can still build a great business, even if you don't dominate, dominate. It's just you won't make as much money, nearly as much profit, basically, your cash flow.

Sarah Tavel (01:28:28):
That's right.

Lenny (01:28:29):
Something that you all at Benchmark are really big on, which I think would be interesting to talk about, is the TAM not being as big a deal as people think. So a lot of times, there's a lot of marketplaces that start very small, and there's a fear that the market is just not going to be big enough for them to build a massive business long-term. And you all don't worry about that as much as a lot of other investors, where the market itself isn't a huge killer of investing.

Sarah Tavel (01:28:57):
I would underline it even, which is that we get excited about the markets, the opportunities, that might seem small from the outside.

Lenny (01:29:05):
I love it. Can you speak to that and help people understand [inaudible 01:29:10]?

Sarah Tavel (01:29:09):
You remember the early days of Airbnb like, "How big could this get?"

Lenny (01:29:14):
Yeah, I wasn't there that early.

Sarah Tavel (01:29:16):
Yeah, but you knew of it, and Etsy also underestimated for years and years and years. Hipcamp, that was part of what excited us is that it was this market that was actually much bigger than people would have thought from the outside. And the wonderful thing about going after these underestimated markets is that they don't have competition in the beginning. And so, you have more of the elements of being able to operate into a market and tip the market towards you, when you don't have competition. And so, we love these types of markets, and we always say, to the founders out there, if other people are telling you the market's too small, we would love to get to know you.

Lenny (01:30:00):
I think a lot of founders will love hearing this. I think it's also important to add something you've shared with me is it's important for there to be adjacent markets that are big, for you to have the potential to expand it to [inaudible 01:30:11].

Sarah Tavel (01:30:10):
Right. And yeah, it's such an important point. The market itself, it can't be a cul-de-sac. You need to start somewhere that has the potential to grow beyond that, but in the beginning, it's going to look small. Let me give you the example of Hipcamp. Hipcamp, when we invested, was literally land. It was land where people... I don't know, Lenny, if you're a camper. I unfortunately am...

Lenny (01:30:38):
Yeah, I love Hipcamp by the way.

Sarah Tavel (01:30:39):
Okay, well, amazing. Well, if you have a tent and a sleeping bag and you're not afraid to put your thermos in a running river and clean the water, then that was the early days of Hipcamp. It was for the hardcore camper, which itself, feels like a very small market. It's not actually that small, but it is a smaller market than other people might themselves get comfortable with. But then, what would happen is that hosts on Hipcamp, and I stayed at one of these Hipcamps, and it's just such an incredible experience, the host started to make a little bit of money from Hipcamp. And they took that money, and they started to invest in structures on their land. So in the beginning, maybe it was a fire pit or a bathroom or shower, and then, it became a tree house or a yurt.

(01:31:34):
And so, what happened with Hipcamp is that, in the beginning, it was going after this very different market segment, but as they became successful, made their landowners money, those landowners invested that money back into their land and started to open up the market opportunity for Hipcamp, into people more like me, that are glampers, that want that experience in nature, but maybe don't want to pitch a tent to have it. And so, that's kind of one of those examples of an underestimated market that ends up growing beyond that. There's warning stories here too. I always think of Etsy. So Etsy, I remember, actually, when I was at Pinterest, being driven crazy by Etsy, because Etsy was all about handmade goods. But as they were running up to going public, they started to chase GMV. And what that looked like is that they started to have a lot of mass produced goods on Etsy.

(01:32:38):
It drove me crazy at Pinterest, because there was this one seller of these scarves, that was clearly a mass produced scarves, and they were spamming Pinterest constantly with pins of those scarves. And it was just very clear that Etsy had kind of lost its way in that moment. They would start to chase GMV growth. They were going beyond what they actually stood for, and they ended up having a real reaction from the sellers that were making handmade goods and the buyers. It was this big erosion of trust, and they ended up, I don't know if it was related, but it ended up precipitating, I think, a CEO change, to the CEO that is there now and who has obviously done an incredible job building Etsy from there.

Lenny (01:33:26):
Yeah, we had the VP of product from Etsy on the podcast. And we talked about that actually, what that transition was like, because it was pretty dramatic. They went from very warm, fuzzy, cozy vibes to, "We need to build a business that lasts. Let's change the way we operate." While we're on this topic of what gets you excited about marketplaces, this is something Mike suggested I ask you, so I love that you get excited when it's a small market, very contrarian, what else, when founders are pitching you, let's say with a marketplace, what else do you look for? Whatever you can share off the top of your head that you look for that gets you excited about marketplace.

Sarah Tavel (01:33:59):
It's a couple things. One is, and I'm thinking actually of one founder I met recently, where there's that earned secret, where they see a market opportunity that other people are overlooking, that hasn't been addressed. Maybe there's a reason why it hasn't been addressed in the past, but now is the moment, there's something changing that's creating a current in the market. We could talk about currents later, if we want to, but that there's something that's creating momentum in the market, that's opening up an opportunity for this marketplace to exist. And for whatever reason, that founder is the person who sees it. And it's kind of one of those things that, once you see it, you're like, "How does it still work this way?" And it makes so much sense for somebody to come in and do something about it. And then, the second thing that always just deeply resonates, and it's obvious at this point why this would be true, is a founder then that really has focus.

(01:35:01):
And it's kind of back to focusing their ambition, like a laser beam, as opposed to this broad sun trying to do everything. And so, you really feel like they're focused on the right things, and that actually leads to the third thing, which is you really feel, when a founder is either trying to fool you or fool themselves with vanity metrics, versus the true intellectual honesty and the intellectual rigor of, "What's really working in my business? What's not working? Where are we focused to make that the best it can be?" And man, that is always, that's how you build long-term, enduring value, and it's something that I think it's consistent across all the founders I'm lucky enough to work with.

Lenny (01:35:52):
What I love about this answer is something I often say about marketplaces is that most of your problems are not marketplace problems or questions. It's just what every startup has to deal with. So what you shared is basically an earned secret, which will apply to any business, which maybe emerges a current in a wave that you can ride, having great focus and also focusing on the right metrics. I 100% agree. And it's also interesting, it could be a marketplace, it cannot be, and I think people often overweight how much... "I'm building a marketplace and I need to think of everything," from this marketplace perspective versus 95% of your challenges, questions, hurdles are going to be just whatever startup has to deal with. And then, there's a bit of specific to marketplace.

Sarah Tavel (01:36:36):
And I want to just double click on the current thing, because it's very related, which is a lot of people, and this is back to maybe our contrarian take on markets, I think a lot of people think about markets almost like these bodies of water. And it's like, "Oh, it's this big body of water that we're going after." And I actually think that the most interesting markets, you have to think of them like currents, where there's something happening in the market that's creating this current, where you can have a plank of wood that you've put on the river and it's going to pull you forward, versus a market that doesn't really have that momentum to it, you're going to have to build something really big and fancy to make any progress. And that's why we care less about market size, because really, what you're looking for when you're looking at a market are what are the dynamics of change, what's the current and momentum that's going to pull the company and make the job easier for the founders to actually build something that endures?

Lenny (01:37:40):
Essentially, "Why now?" is how a lot of people think about this, right?

Sarah Tavel (01:37:44):
Yes, yes.

Lenny (01:37:45):
I love just the visual of a current. There's a startup I invested in, as an example of the opposite, that's a crypto marketplace sort of thing. And they started it when crypto was really great, and they continued building it as crypto winter emerged. And they just realized, "Our timing, this is not the time to build a crypto company, that's new, that's trying to compete with who's out there." And so, it's an example of the... You got to recognize when the wave is going the opposite direction and everything is pulling you away from success. The opposite of what you're describing.

Sarah Tavel (01:38:16):
Yes. I might have a nuance there, because I think crypto is too broad of a way to describe it. If you said it was a DeFi crypto company, then yes, definitely, with treasuries where they are, the opportunity in DeFi isn't as material as it once was, which stablecoins, I'm a huge believer in stablecoins, and I think that's a market where we have a real current. With inflation and so many local currencies, there's real demand for stablecoins, the US dollar stablecoin, that comes in many different shapes and forms, that is something that I believe has a very strong current right now, that I'm actually quite excited about.

Lenny (01:39:01):
Oh, interesting. Yeah, I should have been clear. It's like a very specific part of crypto that's just not happening too much, versus what it was. Okay, we've gone totally off track. So let me come back to our track and see what else you wanted to share around the hierarchy of marketplaces either on the top...

Sarah Tavel (01:39:02):
That's it.

Lenny (01:39:18):
Okay. We did it. Amazing.

Sarah Tavel (01:39:20):
Yes.

Lenny (01:39:20):
I have a couple more questions sort of related, but I guess, is there anything else that you wanted to say about the hierarchy of marketplaces?

Sarah Tavel (01:39:27):
Maybe just this kind of the coda, which is like you can never rest on your laurels, and we talked about this already, but the history of marketplaces is one of disruption. And the idea with happiness is that, and Amazon and Bezos talk about this, which is expectations, consumer expectations, are constantly going up. And so, if you ever stagnate in the experience that you give to the consumer, guess what? You're going to get disrupted. And the examples of we talked about with Airbnb and HomeAway, DoorDash, and Grubhub, Grubhub wasn't able to, for different reasons, they were a public company, and so, they couldn't access capital in the same way that the private markets could. But they were too slow to change the atomic unit of their supply to have delivery that they fulfilled. And so, they got disrupted by the DoorDash, Uber Eats of the world. And so, you just can't rest on your laurels. Expectations constantly go up. And it's part of what's so exciting about this market that we play in.

Lenny (01:40:40):
I think Grubhub is a great example of that, where they were the first really successful food delivery company, and then, even with network effects, by far, the best way to order. And then, DoorDash comes around and wins, because they go bigger and spend a lot of money that Grubhub wasn't willing to spend. Awesome. So I guess the advice there is just don't take for granted your success, even if you have amazing network effects.

Sarah Tavel (01:41:02):
That's right.

Lenny (01:41:03):
Okay. So as we were chatting about this conversation, something you mentioned is that, even if you're not building a marketplace, these lessons are actually still useful. So say you're building an open source product or a social network or even a SaaS startup, a lot of these sort of lessons can still apply. What advice would you have for people that have heard what you just shared, but aren't necessarily building a marketplace? What are some of the takeaways as well?

Sarah Tavel (01:41:26):
At Benchmark, I'm lucky that I have partners who look at very different types of companies that I look at, and we meet such a incredible breadth of founders. And what you just realize, again and again, is that these same lessons hold. With open source, it's about solving a specific developer's need in the beginning and solving it really freaking well, and then, expanding from there. With SaaS, I think maybe the fascinating exception, kind of similar to your Thumbtack exception, I think what Parker Conrad's doing with Rippling and this idea of a compound startup is very different. And actually, he has a level of ambition that is both the sun and a laser at the same time. And so, that's kind of, in a rare founder, you can have that level of execution, but again and again, what you see, and I think a lot of this, for new companies leveraging large language models to build products, is that focus on a constrained market to start is the way to win.

Lenny (01:42:34):
I like that. Basically, it's happy developer in the case of DevTools or happy enterprise user, just get happy people using your product and coming back to it. So I love that as a reminder. One other question is you wrote this post on finding white space in building marketplace, basically someone that wants to build a marketplace, trying to figure out, where is there an opportunity for new marketplace? Do you have any advice for people, say, founders, potential founders, that are looking for ideas and opportunities to build a marketplace for how to find one? Where do you think there's opportunity?

Sarah Tavel (01:43:05):
It's kind of fun to ask the question whether LLMs change the game or open up new surface area. So in my post, I write about three ways that you can look for a new opportunity. I think it was like, number one, you always find a horizontal marketplace and you find the kind of low NPS part of that segment and you create a marketplace around that. eBay, being a horizontal marketplace, the sneakers being a low NPS part of that, and you get GOAT. The second is finding a niche that no one else is paying attention to. And the Etsy examples we gave, the Hipcamp stories, and bringing that online, taking friction away, and showing that it's actually a bigger market than you think. And then, the third is changing the atomic unit of the supply. So that kind of like Grubhub, the atomic unit there was a restaurant that has its own delivery fleet, and then, Postmates, DoorDash, Uber Eats came in and said, "Actually, it's any restaurant, we'll provide the delivery fleet."

(01:44:15):
And so, they opened up the available supply. Now, when I think about LLMs, I think there's a real opportunity for the third one. LLMs may make it possible to bring on a supply type that maybe the long tail, that was just, it was too much effort to reach out to them, onboard them, but maybe if you automate that work, you actually create an opportunity to expand the supply in a way that none of us can anticipate right now. And then, who knows whether there's an opportunity with LLMs to create a better experience in one of these kind of low NPS segments of a market or a niche market itself, that makes it possible to bring it online. So I haven't seen anything yet, but I am definitely on the hunt.

Lenny (01:45:05):
Very cool. Turned into AI corner, which I love. Okay, well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Sarah Tavel (01:45:14):
Okay, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:45:16):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Sarah Tavel (01:45:22):
Pachinko is one of the best fictional books I've read in a while. I just loved it, and so, I highly recommend that. And then, to founders, I am a sucker for The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. It's kind of like you imagine those books in the grocery store aisle, but they're fast reads that are incredibly insightful and I highly recommend.

Lenny (01:45:47):
Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoy?

Sarah Tavel (01:45:51):
I don't watch stuff, so I'm not a good candidate there.

Lenny (01:45:55):
I highly respect that. Is there a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates, which usually, we can transform into when you're talking to founders and trying to decide if you want to invest?

Sarah Tavel (01:46:06):
I always love hearing the journey people take and specifically how they've made decisions along the way, what drives them from each step. I think that's always very illuminating.

Lenny (01:46:20):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's an app or physical product that you've used often? Anything real cool or fun?

Sarah Tavel (01:46:31):
I'll say we are late joiners to Tesla, my family. And man, it is one of those products that you use it for the first time, and you're just like, "I could see why I'd want to own equity in this company," not financial advice obviously, but it's just an awesome experience.

Lenny (01:46:53):
I completely agree. I've gotten so used to, we have a regular car and a Tesla, and the fact that you don't need a key anymore, you just walk up and open it, because it has your phone... My wife, she left the key in our Subaru, just because she's like, "Oh, shit, I need to take the key out." It's just sitting there running. Yeah, you're so used to just the casual just walk up, open, you're good to go. Awesome. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, either in work or life, that you find useful?

Sarah Tavel (01:47:25):
My partner at Greylock, Reid Hoffman, has this line of every strength has a corresponding weakness, and vice versa, and there's so much wisdom there. We see our own strengths and we see our weaknesses, but not realize that they actually go together. You can't have one without the other. Similarly, strengths in organizations, like a decentralized organization can move really quickly, and the corresponding weakness of that is that it can feel chaotic and disorganized. On the other side, a centralized organization can feel really slow, but it is very intentional in the decision-making and the control of the experience. And so, everything has trade-offs, and realizing that, more often than not, they come together, it's just so useful to be aware of that.

Lenny (01:48:20):
Awesome. Final question. I believe you played rugby at some point, is that right?

Sarah Tavel (01:48:24):
Yes.

Lenny (01:48:25):
Okay. Is there a rugby story that would be fun to share from your time playing rugby? And if not, what should people know? What would surprise people about rugby, that they may not be aware of?

Sarah Tavel (01:48:36):
Well, what people might be surprised of, especially if they meet me, is that I was actually a really good tackler, and I think I broke my nose a couple times and have more injuries than I would care to remember, but I definitely inflicted more injuries on other people than I received. And I think rugby is, there's a camaraderie that comes with rugby, and the one thing I'll confess is that we always joke that the rugby team is, it's not a rugby team, it's a drinking team, that has a rugby problem.

Lenny (01:49:18):
Amazing.

Sarah Tavel (01:49:19):
Those times are behind me.

Lenny (01:49:20):
Oh, man. It sounds like an awesome person to have in your court when you're a founder, the best tackler in town.

Sarah Tavel (01:49:27):
Heck yes.

Lenny (01:49:28):
Amazing. Sarah, I'm not surprised this went as long as it did. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask follow-up questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Sarah Tavel (01:49:41):
I appreciate that. I'm Sarah at Benchmark. I'm on Twitter, Sarah Tavel, and I have a Substack, SarahTavel.com. If you're a founder, you're working on something, don't be shy. We're in the business of meeting with people like you, and so, I always love to get stimulated by new ideas and people.

Lenny (01:50:03):
Just to focus people even more there, is there stage you like, is there markets, anything people should know of what's right for you?

Sarah Tavel (01:50:09):
We, at Benchmark, we're early stage. We're an early stage firm. We aspire to be first board member. Usually, it looks like the series A, and that's really where our sweet spot is.

Lenny (01:50:23):
Awesome. Sarah, thank you so much for being here.

Sarah Tavel (01:50:26):
Thank you for having me.

# Inside Devin: The AI engineer that's set to write 50% of its company’s code this year | Scott Wu

## Transcript

Scott Wu (00:00:00):
Our whole team is only like 15 engineers a year. We use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin. Most folks on the team are definitely working with up to five Devins at once, and so Devin merges like several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?

Scott Wu (00:00:16):
It's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
Where do you think this will be at the end of the year?

Scott Wu (00:00:21):
Honestly, we expect it to be a decent bit more than half.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers.

Scott Wu (00:00:28):
AI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, so most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, like personal computer, and the internet, and the mobile phone, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. Folks who were building for those industries kind of saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, right, as the number of people connected to the internet increase. One of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. There's no weight on hardware distribution. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
How is the act of being an engineer and building changing?

Scott Wu (00:01:05):
I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now. Pretty quickly. The form factor of what it means to be a programmer obviously is going to change, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being able to tell your computer what's do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):
Today my guest is Scott Wu. Scott is the co-founder and CEO of Cognition, which makes a product called Devin, the world's first autonomous AI software engineer. Unlike other AI tools that I've highlighted on this podcast, Devin is designed to act like an actual remote engineer that you chat with like you would with any other human engineer through Slack or through its dedicated website. When Devin launched about a year ago, it was very much a junior engineer. Over the past year, they've made a lot of progress and Devin is now being used by tons of companies in production. We chatted about how their engineering team of 15 uses Devins to build Devin, including how every engineer uses about five Devins each to help them code and move faster. How a quarter of their pull requests today are committed by Devins and that they expect this to be over 50% by the end of the year.

(00:02:05):
We also talk about how Scott imagines software engineering is going to look in the future and how the role of an engineer changes from a coder to an architect. We also get into the eight pivots that they went through before landing on this path, why Scott believes AI tools like this will lead to more engineer hiring versus less. Also where the name Devin comes from and so much more. This episode is going to blow your mind. I highly recommend you listen to it if you're at all interested about where engineering, product building, and AI is going. A huge thank you to Claire Voue for suggesting a bunch of great questions for this conversation.

Brandon Foo (00:04:15):
Hey Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):
So integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?

Brandon Foo (00:04:21):
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
So where does Paragon fit into all this?

Brandon Foo (00:04:42):
Well, these integrations are a pain to build and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
And I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.

Brandon Foo (00:05:01):
Exactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out paragon@useparagon.com/lenny. Scott, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Scott Wu (00:05:29):
Thanks so much for having me. Excited to be on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
I'm really excited to have you here because you are building and you've been building something that is very different from what a lot of other AI companies have been doing for a long time, although they are starting to converge to where you guys are now. We're going to talk about that and it's also just such a unique point in the history of AI and just the journey of AI. And so it's really cool to be chatting right now. And I feel like we're going to chat again in a few years and be like, wow, we were so right about so much and so wrong about so much.

Scott Wu (00:05:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):
And so I'm excited to have you here. Let's start with talking about Devin, giving people an understanding of just what the heck Devin is, is the main product that you guys build. What is the simplest way to understand what is Devin?

Scott Wu (00:06:10):
Absolutely. And so Devin is a fully autonomous software engineer that is going to work on tasks end to end, and so there are a lot of great tools for all parts of the stack of the AI code workflow. What Devin does is it is a full asynchronous workflow, and so you can tag Devin on an issue in Slack, you're talking about an issue and you tag Devin, you can tag Devin in Linear, you can have Devin and Devin will make pull requests in your GitHub, and so it's very much built to work with engineering teams as your junior engineer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
Amazing, okay. So I remember when you guys launched this, there was this big pitch of this is your new AI engineer and it was really good at a lot of stuff. It wasn't great at other things. It's been a year now about since you guys launched, is that right?

Scott Wu (00:06:50):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
What's the best way to think about the level of seniority that engineer had back in the day when you guys launched and then the level of seniority of engineer today if that's, I don't know, measure of how to think about Devin?

Scott Wu (00:07:02):
Yeah, and it's crazy to think about by the way, because a year ago when we did the initial launch, I mean people didn't really believe that an agent was possible. Right. And it was, I mean, it was a very different time. So like start of 2024, things with model capabilities were definitely quite a bit earlier on, reasoning especially was quite a bit earlier on. And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer. But I would say though that those are more rough guidelines because I really like the phrase jagged intelligence for example, because obviously there are certain things that it is much better at than a human. There are certain things that it's much worse at than a human.

(00:07:52):
And I think over the last year we've learned a lot especially about not just coding agents but agents in general just really building out how all of us should be working and interacting with agents as part of our flow. And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth. There was no way to touch up Devin's code. And so a lot of the features that we've built on the product side since then have really been about basically yeah, figuring out how to make working with Devin and handing off tasks to Devin as smooth of an experience as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:27):
That's so interesting. So a lot of the work has gone not into how do we just make Devin the best possible engineer, but it's how to work with this new type of entity that we haven't ever worked with.

Scott Wu (00:08:37):
I think it's a 50/50 of both. I think the capabilities obviously have improved a ton and we've seen these get better and get measurably better. But I think the other side of it is everything to do with yeah, really the product interface and the tools and so on. And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well. But I think this is the kind of thing that we're all really figuring out together as a space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:15):
What can you share about just the scale of Devin at this point, whatever you're comfortable sharing, and then just where do you think the level of Devin's coding abilities will be in a year?

Scott Wu (00:09:24):
So we work with companies of all stages and sizes. On the smallest end, it goes to startups of just one or two people who are using Devin to build out a lot of their kind of initial prototype or initial product all the way up to big public companies, Fortune 100 companies or public banks or things like that who are using Devin across their engineering teams. In general, we've seen a huge range of the use cases there. And obviously the kinds of engineering work that you're doing at a one or two person startup, they're very different from the kind of work that you're doing at a public bank.

(00:09:55):
But throughout it's all been basically yeah, being that junior buddy of yours that makes you go faster and really multiplies you, I would say. I think it can multiply you as an engineer obviously by just letting you work with your own team of Devins instead of having to be kind of fully synchronous on a single task. And then it's also kind of multiplying your team and multiplying your team's knowledge base because Devin really accumulates a lot of the knowledge from working with every member of your team and is able to bring that into each new session.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):
Awesome. We're going to show people how it actually works later in the podcast. We're going to do a few live demos, but let's actually go to the beginning of the journey. What's just the origin story of Devin? How did this all begin?

Scott Wu (00:10:33):
The founding team, I mean most of us have known each other for years and years and years actually. And for almost everyone, this is our first time working together, but we've known each other a long time. And we all actually had our own kind of journeys in AI for the last decade or so. And so for myself, I ran a company before this called Lunchclub, which was an AI for a professional networking product and I ran that for about five years. And one of my co-founders, Steven was one of the first engineers at a company called Scale AI, which has obviously grown a lot and done very well. My other co-founder Walden, was an early engineer at a company called Cursor, which has also obviously grown a lot and done really well. And our whole team was kind of like that. Many of us knew each other from competitive programming and math competitions, but we had stayed very closely in touch in the decade since then and we've all kind of all had our own journeys.

(00:11:22):
And so we had one person who was running teams at Neuro, we had one person who was at Waymo, someone who had their own YC tools startup for machine learning, and we were really excited to build something together. And this was around late 2023, so about a year and a half ago at this point. And yeah, when we got started, I mean I think there were a couple of things that we felt really strongly about and one was that reinforcement learning was really working and was going to be the next big paradigm shift in capabilities. Back then it was the initial ChatGPT launch in 2022, and those models were, to first order were what we would call imitation learning in AI, right, which is basically you have the model read all the texts that you can find on the internet and then train it to talk like somebody on the internet would talk. Right. And there are kind of obviously a lot more details on top of that, but that's kind of the first order pass of what was really done.

(00:12:16):
And it was amazing. Right. I mean, it passed the churn test, it was able to respond and to have encyclopedic knowledge about a lot of things. And I think this new paradigm which we've gotten into over this last year or year and a half is really high compute RL, which is a very different paradigm, right, which is basically the ability to go and do work on task and put something together and then be evaluated on whether that was correct or incorrect and use that knowledge to decide what to do and to learn from that. Right. And so we felt very strongly that that was going to happen. I think for us, code was the natural thing to work on for a couple reasons. One, because we're all programmer nerds ourselves, and so teaching AI to code is about as cool as it gets for us, but also because code has this whole automated feedback loop, right, where you can run the code and that is the kind of automated feedback that really feeds into the RL, which makes these models so great at coding.

(00:13:06):
And then the other thing that we felt very strongly about was that the product experience was going to shift from what I'll call text completion to agents basically. Right. And to first order, I would kind of say there's been a lot of great experiences in text completion. It's been used for marketing, it's been used for customer support, it's been used for education and in Coda obviously as well. The GitHub copilot was kind of really the dominant product of that initial wave. Right.

(00:13:34):
But I think that the big shift that we really felt we would see is moving from kind of this text to text model to an actual autonomous system that can make decisions, that can interact with the real world, that can take in feedback, that can iterate and take multiple steps to solve problems. And now we call that agents, but that was what we were really excited about at the time. So it was always coding, it was always agents. And in some ways that kind of feels like it should have been cleared from the start. But even with that, I feel like we've pivoted eight times or something within coding agents over the last year and a half, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
I just noticed recently all the AI, top AI companies sort of, not all, but many of them, the product that is winning is different, has a different name from the company, which is not typical, Cursors, Anysphere, Bolt, StackBlitz, you guys are Cognition Labs, like V0 is Vercel. And it just tells me these all emerge later in the company's journey and they tried a bunch of stuff and like, oh wow, this thing worked and it's so interesting that it's so common amongst these top AI companies.

Scott Wu (00:14:34):
Yeah, and there's even, I mean OpenAI, ChatGPT, Anthropic and Claude and Google. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, yeah, I agree. So when we got started, it wasn't even really a company. I mean, it was more like a project or a hackathon almost. We got a bunch, we booked an Airbnb basically for a couple of weeks. This was around Thanksgiving time and just got a bunch of people together who were just excited to hack on some projects and build something cool. And it's funny, actually the first thing that we were building for actually was more solving these more contest programming problems and using an agentic loop to really do better on that. And so obviously if you run your code on the test cases, you can evaluate, there's a lot of agentic work that you can do there to try and do better, and that we spent some time on that initially. And then we've kind of gone from, I mean the story of the whole company for us in some sense has been going from hacker house to hacker house.

(00:15:26):
So after that we had another hacker house and that's where kind of some of the initial ideas for Devin came and really building a software engineering agent and not just a coding agent and having to interact with a lot of these tools, but even then there were so many iterations. And even the idea of talking to Devin for example was like, it was something that we had to come up with. Right. Initially, it was just like you hand off a task and then it works and then it shows you this whole finished code. Right. And now obviously it's like you can jump in at any time, you can get feedback on the plan, you guys can scope out the task together when you're working with Devin. And a lot of these things we had to develop obviously, and certainly we've learned a lot about the use cases, the form factor. We've made a lot of big improvements and step function improvements on the capabilities and Devin's ability to use tools and to bug and make decisions.

(00:16:11):
And so it's yeah, it's been a fun journey. I mean, I think I would say that the grounding question for us really, which is one that we think about all the time, is really just what is the future of software engineering and how should we be working with AI to write code? Because I think at the end of the day, of course that's what underlines all of the product decisions that we make, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
I like that you're asking the juicy question I wanted to get to. Before I ask it just for the history books, when did you guys start kind of hacking around and when did Devin launch? How long was that period?

Scott Wu (00:16:45):
Yeah, so we started in November of 2023, which was then yeah, just like hackathon mode. We officially made it into a company around the start of 2024, and then our initial launch was in March. And so it was like nonstop, I mean it's been nonstop for the entire last 17 months, but it's getting to the launch and then obviously working with enterprises and developing the product a lot more, building it and getting it to work for a lot of practical use cases and then making it fully available self-serve in December of last year. And now we've rolled out 2.0 obviously just a few weeks ago. And so it's been a very busy time for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):
Understatement of the century. Let me ask this question because you touched on it a bit, this whole idea of Devin as a person and this idea of creating a personality for Devin. It's unlike any other, I believe, AI app. No one else has a name and you don't think of it as a person. What made you guys decide to go that approach and just how do you design it to work well that way?

Scott Wu (00:17:44):
I would say it's a decision we're pretty proud of, I would say. I mean, I think there's a lot of different product experiences out there, and I think the thing that really makes Devin unique in what it does is that you can really hand off and more and more what we've seen honestly is that I think a lot of kind of explaining the Devin experience to folks is really just explain it as, yeah, this is your junior buddy. And that goes for a lot of the parts of the flow where in the onboarding for example, initially I would say we've definitely had a lot of users come in and just kind of see the blank screen and not really know, or they'd ask, "Hey, I'm going to do this whole big re-architecture, the whole code base."

(00:18:21):
And basically what we've learned over time is to basically get folks to think more like whoa, whoa, whoa, let's work on getting the repository set up first. Let's make sure we hand Devin a couple one pointer tasks so it can get familiar with the code base. Let's get it the thing. If Devin needs to be able to test the code or run the linter or CI or things like that. Obviously we want to make sure Devin's got its own virtual machine set up to be able to do that.

(00:18:45):
And similarly, I think the usage pattern, I think often it wasn't clear and obviously you can sit and just kind of watch Devin do it action by action and work that way, but we found that the best workflow really as a team building a lot of stuff was to work with multiple Devins and to run them asynchronously and to kick them off and to only jump in basically as you needed to provide feedback or steer the plan or anything like that. And so in many ways, I think Devin as a name really is our attempt to kind of capture the soul of that as a product where it really is treating it like a bit more of an autonomous entity that you can hand off tasks, that you can work with, that you should be teaching and learning with over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:29):
I want to come back to an area you started us down and then I took us away from which is impact on software engineering and how software engineering is going to change. So there's kind of two parts to this. Just like when people are using Devin today, say this year, how is the act of being an engineer and building changing for those companies? What does that look like?

Scott Wu (00:19:49):
By the way, we're all software engineers ourselves. It's like I'm a programmer by training and still a programmer at heart certainly. And I think the way that we've always thought about it is there's layers of abstraction and there's tools, and one way I would say it at a high level is kind of I think of AI in general as, yeah, I mean computers are obviously getting more and more intelligence and are able to do more and more and it's possible there may come a day where computers truly do everything that we do and humans are not responsible for any of it.

(00:20:20):
I don't expect that to come particularly soon, but I guess what I would say is until that point, for as long as we're still part of the equation, one of the most important things to do obviously is for us as humans is to instruct our computers on what we want and what we want to build and what we want to do. Right. And software engineering is, we think of it today obviously as Python and C++ and JavaScript and all these things, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being to tell your computer what to do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is, if anything, is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful. And I think the thing that's really exciting for us is yeah, it's really seeing that kind of iterative transformation. And so you ask what things look like today, and I would say, yeah, it really is like having a junior buddy or really a team of junior buddies that you can work with. Right.

(00:21:12):
And so every engineer on our team, we use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin, and so Devin merges several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month, which is, I mean, our whole team is only 15 engineers, and so it's a pretty sizable fraction of all the code that we write. And the way that we use it is basically, yeah, everyone's got their whole team of Devins. If you're going to be looking through various issues, if you're going through feature requests, if you're going through bugs, if you're going through new paradigms that you want to build, then it is naturally the case that there's a lot of handoff points where you just say, "Hey, at Devin, here's what's going on. Can you please take a pass at this?" Right.

(00:21:47):
And sometimes Devin will be able to do the task 100% autonomously and just makes the PR and then you merge the PR and that's great. Sometimes you want to be able to jump in for the 10 or 20% that really needs your help. Maybe there's a few details with how exactly you want to scope it or how you're architecting this feature, or maybe you want to go and test the front end at the end yourself to make sure it looks exactly the way that you want and give your one or two lines of feedback after that. Right. But a lot of it is really yeah, is kind of like yeah, learning to work with Devin to be able to just do more in parallel and build more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):
What percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?

Scott Wu (00:22:25):
Yeah, I'd have to look, but it's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so of all of our-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):
Wow.

Scott Wu (00:22:31):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):
And then what was it like six months ago?

Scott Wu (00:22:35):
Oh yeah, it's grown a ton for, I mean, we've seen it grown exponentially internally ourselves as well. And so it's kind of an interesting one where again, it's always both the capabilities and the product interface. And so I think the intelligence has increased a lot. But the other thing of course is that we've spent a lot of time in figuring out how to build and to really kind of build for an interface where you can get Devin's value on tasks where Devin is able to do the 80 or 90%. And so Devin is obviously not perfect and it'll make mistakes and so on. And a lot of the question is basically, yeah, how do you scope out your initial task with Devin and then just kind of set Devin off and have it go and do the things that you want do? How do you come in at the end and review and give feedback? How do you make sure Devin learns over time? How are you able to kind of just check in as needed and course correct if you want to?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):
Okay, so today about quarter of your PRs are Devins. Where do you think this will be at the end of the year? What would you guess?

Scott Wu (00:23:31):
I think by the end of this year, we expect it to be more than half. And I mean, as time goes on, one of the things that we've seen is just you're able to do more and more and more work asynchronously. Right. And you're able to hand off more and more. I think the soul of programming, the soul of software engineering has really been about through all the areas, not just now, but even when it was assembly, right, and even when it was Pascal and even when it was punch cards or whatever, I think the soul of it has really been basically just about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly...

Scott Wu (00:24:00):
... about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly what is the solution that you want to build. Thinking through the architecture, thinking through the details, and really mapping out in your mind exactly what you want to build basically and what you want to have your computer do. I think that's what makes software engineering really great and I think that's the funnest part of software engineering. 

(00:24:21):
I think, at the same time, that's probably in the neighborhood of 10% of the average software engineer's time, right? Because 90% of the time is you've got this Kubernetes error, then you've got to debug, and you have to see what went wrong and the system crash, or you left some port open and this is messing up, or there's a bug report that you have to take care of, or you've got to migrate your code, or you got it upgraded to a new version or things like that. A lot more implementation. 

(00:24:48):
One of the ways that we've kind of thought about Devin in building Devin is really allowing engineers to go from bricklayer to architect, so to speak. A lot of it is just getting to the point where you can do the high-level directing and you can basically specify things exactly how you want. I think it's very much about still having the human in control and having the human able to do the full specification, but just multiplying the magnitude of what you can do and what you can build in one day or one hour or however long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):
In the future, say someone is trying to get into software engineering, thinking about becoming an engineer, first of all, do you think people should... Classic question everyone's getting these days. Should you still learn to code? 

Scott Wu (00:25:29):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
I'd love your perspective there. And then two, for people that are engineers today, what skills do you think will be more and more important and then less important in this discussion of moving from bricklayer to architect? 

Scott Wu (00:25:41):
Yeah, for sure. I love this question. First of all, the question of whether you should still learn to code, my answer would be absolutely yes. I think, to a large extent, when you take computer science classes and when you learn these fundamentals, sure you're learning a little bit about how a particular language is, syntax works or something like that. But honestly, most of what you're learning really is about the ability to logically break down problems for number one. And two, I would say is just the model of a computer and a lot of these decisions and a lot of the abstractions that we've built over time. 

(00:26:11):
What is a database and how should you think about a database? What is a garbage collection system and how do those work and all of these different pieces? The reason I think that's important is because it's the same with a lot of these other... Arguably we've already gone through these phases in programming and I think this next one is going to be somewhat faster and somewhat bigger, but in many ways a similar flavor, which is when you work with Python today, obviously, a lot of things are already abstracted away from you.

(00:26:38):
In some sense, someone from 50 years ago might already call Python. You just get to explain in English what you want and now the computer does it for you. That's great and I think it's really powerful. It's opened it up. I mean, we have far more programmers, obviously, than we ever have before because of that, but I would say certainly as you're building your skills as an engineer, it really helps a lot to understand the abstractions and to be able to peel the layers beneath. Folks will use assembly for example if they're really performance optimizing a piece of code, but also in order to build good systems and to understand these things, you certainly want to understand these abstractions of how does networking work. 

(00:27:18):
What is TCP/IP like exactly or what happens with this Python code when it gets interpreted or all of these details. Similarly, I think we will get to a state where, with no experience at all, you're going to be able to build some pretty cool stuff and to do some pretty amazing work just by explaining what it is that you want. But I think that, for quite some time, you really want to be able to think precisely about the details, to peel back the abstractions, to be very precise about what it is that you want to build and how.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):
And then for skills that you think are more and more valuable for engineers, where should engineers today be leaning more and more into versus like, "Forget this. I don't need to think about this anymore"?

Scott Wu (00:28:00):
For sure. I think architect... I mean, we already have a term for architect and engineering and I think it is directionally the right term. It's, I think, one thing to just do a routine implementation and write boilerplate code and things like that. I would say that, in many ways, AI coding has already made us much faster at that, but I think a lot of the core questions of understanding very complex systems and working in the context of the whole company and thinking about the product that you're building or the work that you're doing and understanding, "Okay, what are the problems that we want to solve? How do we want to solve those problems? What is exactly the solution that we want to build? What are all of these key decisions and trade-offs that we're going to be making?"

(00:28:40):
Basically, I think folks who are able to do that really, really well are just going to be able to leverage themselves more and more. If anything, I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now than there are today. I think pretty quickly the form factor of what it means to be a programmer, obviously, is going to change. And in some sense, it already has, but I think there's just going to be so much more for us to build. Folks talk about Jevons Paradox all the time. I mean, software is truly the shining example of Jevons Paradox, where we have always managed as a society to find more and more things that we want to build software for and build more code for. I really think there's a lot more out there to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
For people that don't know Jevons Paradox, can you briefly explain it?

Scott Wu (00:29:26):
Absolutely. Yeah. Jevons Paradox just says that as the price of something goes down, it can still be the case that the total spend on it actually goes up. You can think about this with money, you can think about this with time or resources, but the direct version here is, I think, as it becomes easier and easier to program and as programming becomes more and more effective, I think we're going to have a lot more programmers. I think in a kind of zero-sum view, you might say, "Well, we're going to be 10 times faster at software engineering and it means that we're going to need 10 times fewer software engineers." But I think in practice, what really is going to happen is actually we're going to build even more than 10 times as much code. And because all of the work that we do is so capped, obviously, on our ability to actually build and execute and iterate, we're going to have so many great ideas out there, we're going to have so many great products out there. People are going to build a lot more personalized experiences, for example, and there's going to be a lot to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):
Going back to the way you guys use Devin, you said that every engineer has this fleet of Devins. How many Devins per engineer do you find most people are working with these days at your company?

Scott Wu (00:30:33):
Yeah. It's very asynchronous. Obviously, you can kick them up and start them up and shut them down basically as you see fit, but most folks on the team are often working with up to five Devins at once, I would say. It's a nice flow where you think through, "All right, what are the five things that we want to get done today?" You have Devin one do number one, you have Devin two do number two, Devin three... For what it's worth, I think it's taken us some time to adjust to it and get to the point where it's really intuitive for us, but I think it's definitely a different experience where you're handing off most things asynchronously. 

(00:31:14):
The goal for each of your tasks is to be there for the parts that really need your expertise, either you really, really need to define exactly what it is that you're solving for and what you're building or maybe some of the more complex parts where you want to steer Devin towards, particularly what kinds of changes you want to make. "I want the class to be set up this way and we should go and change all the downstream references to this as well or whatever." But basically having Devin do the bulk of the work asynchronously with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
And then how many engineers do you guys have roughly?

Scott Wu (00:31:46):
Yeah, our engineering team today is about 15 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
15. 15.

Scott Wu (00:31:50):
15, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):
Holy moly. Okay. And then each one has five-ish Devins.

Scott Wu (00:31:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
So there's five times the number of Devins as engineers. What I love about this is just a glimpse into where the future is going. You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers. Seeing how you operate is going to be, as a sense, essentially how most companies will end up operating.

Scott Wu (00:32:11):
Yeah. For what it's worth, we've already seen this shift, I would say, ourselves where... In terms of the team, obviously, folks don't spend that much of their time just writing out boilerplate or just doing pure implementation of features. People get to spend much more of their time focused on really just thinking about the core questions of, "How do we make Devin better? What is the right interface for Devin? What is the right flow or the right set of features that's really going to make this as great of an experience as possible?" That's how we like things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:46):
When is the point you reach, where there's takeoff of this being the by... Your Devin starts moving so much further ahead of everyone else. Once you have enough Devins doing all these things, they're just like wherever and you're 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 100 years ahead.

Scott Wu (00:33:00):
Honestly, as a community, I think all of us as engineers around the world, I think, are going to have to think about this and build for this and adapt to these new technologies. But what I would say is, I think more and more... Especially as capabilities get better, but certainly even in studies say today, I think more and more things are going to shift towards this asynchronous flow. And one of the reasons I would say for that is in the real world, you're just capped by real world constraints. I think that one way to put it is kind of like... Don't take these numbers exactly, but it's kind of like the first order math of it is, of course, being able to write files or to complete this function or complete this line or things like that.

(00:33:44):
It helps a ton. It's a really great experience. There's a lot of parts of building software that obviously are almost not that at all, right? If you have a bug that you're trying to fix and so you spin up the local server, you click around on your own product on the front end and try to reproduce the bug yourself. Once you have the error, you take a look at Datadog and you see what happened and you try to find other errors in the logs. You look at those files and you see what went wrong, you make some edits, maybe you go and rerun the whole process again now that you make sure your change looks right. That's a lot of what it means to be a software engineer. These are processes that take real time. I think we're going to shift more and more towards this agentic workflow, because that's in some ways the way to really get to that 200%, 500%, 1000% gains that we'll be getting to with software engineering over the next few years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):
Enough talk. Let's show people what the heck this actually looks like. You've got a couple demos prepped that show a few use cases that you found helpful. You're going to pull up your screen and then we'll kick it off and then we'll talk as it's happening.

Scott Wu (00:34:52):
Yeah. The whole process obviously of working with Devin is working asynchronously. I thought it'd be cool for us to actually just watch Devin a little bit in action and then we can go through some other examples of work that Devin's done or things that Devin does for us, even on our team for example. But then we can check back in asynchronously with our Devin after. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):
Let's do it. 

Scott Wu (00:35:13):
I'll share this real quick. The key thing that I would just emphasize here is a lot of it obviously is really just about thinking about as a software engineer or as engineers ourselves or engineering teams, PMs, and so on. What are the things that we would want to build that we would want to hand off? We have Devin set up with our own Devin code base, for example, and so I'll go ahead and kick off with Devin for that. I'll just say, "Devin, I'm on with my friend, Lenny."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):
Hi, Devin.

Scott Wu (00:35:48):
"Can you modify Devin web app two?" Let's feature your newsletter as part of the Devin website. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):
Let's do it. On the real Devin website. 

Scott Wu (00:36:02):
"Feature Lenny's site." 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):
Yeah, lose all your features. 

Scott Wu (00:36:06):
We're going to kick this off. As you can see, Devin gets started instantly and goes ahead and responds. Again, you can work with this asynchronously, you can work with it synchronously as well. For this, we'll just kind of go in a little bit and see exactly what's going on. But as you can see here, Devin's going through files and taking a look through a lot of stuff. We can follow here basically as we need to and see what makes sense. You can see Devin's already called out a few particular pieces where there's the sidebar, which we have implemented on the front end, and there's pieces there. We're going to have a new component and that component's going to link to Lenny's website. That all sounds good. Devin's asking us any questions if there's anything that we have here. Same story here where you can let Devin make its own decisions and hand off, or you can go ahead and give some more thoughts. Should the button open in a new tab or within an application? I'll say let's open it in a new tab.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
And you could answer these at any point. Is it waiting for the answer? 

Scott Wu (00:37:06):
You answer these at any point, you can hand off, hand back off. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):
It's not going to be like, "Just god damn it. I just wrote it this way. Why didn't you tell me earlier?" 

Scott Wu (00:37:11):
That's right. One of the big pieces with Devin is Devin will always be enthusiastic, will always be ready to put in the hours. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):
Thanks for changing scope. Thanks, Scott.

Scott Wu (00:37:24):
We'll give Devin a chance to work and it's going to go through these files and it'll make a pull request for us and we'll see and go from there. But I thought it'd be fun to show some other examples of Devin in action as well. One of the examples actually this morning, which I just used Devin for, is I asked Devin to help me brush my own facts up for this podcast. Obviously, a huge fan of the podcast and the newsletter. I asked Devin, "Hey, Devin. I'm to be on the podcast. Could you please research everything you can about him and make a nice website quiz for me so that I can make sure I know my facts?" This was just this morning, I asked Devin to do this and I'll just show what Devin did, it looks like. Went to Wikipedia first. Unfortunately, it's not a page in Wikipedia, which is... Lenny, we will work on that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:09):
I'm not a big enough deal yet. 

Scott Wu (00:38:12):
They did you dirty. I mean, we need a page list. And so then it went and found it on Spotify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):
So you're watching what it's researching live?

Scott Wu (00:38:21):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was this morning, obviously. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):
This is a playback of what Devin did. This is part of Devin you could just watch what it did.

Scott Wu (00:38:29):
Yeah, yeah. Especially when you're building engineering products or something like that, you can see each of the steps that Devin was doing, or if Devin tested the code locally, obviously you want to be able to go and look and see what Devin was cooking around with and testing or things like that. It found the newsletter. It's going and looking at this and it's going and reading all of this. And then it says, "Okay, let's get started with putting the code together." It says, "Hey, I've researched." It's going through and writing all of this, putting the app together. It plays its own quiz itself. Actually, we should just play this quiz actually. Let's see how much I know. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):
[inaudible 00:39:05]

Scott Wu (00:39:06):
What is the name?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):
What is the name of the podcast? Lenny's Podcast. For people not watching, so to say, approximately how many subscribers? A million. Very good.

Scott Wu (00:39:17):
Yeah. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:18):
What are three main topics Lenny is focused on? Oh, product, growth, and career. Very good. It's a good quiz [inaudible 00:39:25] of people. 

Scott Wu (00:39:25):
What does [inaudible 00:39:26] besides podcasting?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):
What does Lenny do besides podcasting? 

Scott Wu (00:39:30):
I'd say writing, investing, and advising. How often does Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:35):
[inaudible 00:39:35]

Scott Wu (00:39:35):
Once a week, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):
Once a week.

Scott Wu (00:39:37):
Yeah. We can go through all these and do all these. I took this quiz, by the way, obviously, to make sure that I was well-prepped, but this is kind of one of the more fun examples, obviously, of [inaudible 00:39:46]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:46):
Scott, how many subscribers do I have at my newsletter?

Scott Wu (00:39:50):
Over a million, actually. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:52):
[inaudible 00:39:52]

Scott Wu (00:39:53):
And then one last one I'll show and then maybe we can come back to our initial run after. Like I was saying, a lot of this is really built to work with all of the existing code workflows out there. For example, we were doing some exploration with the DeepSeek repository on GitHub and we imported it into Devin and we got our own fork of it set up in Devin. A couple of things I just wanted to show here. One is Devin sets up its whole wiki with all of its internal understanding. When Devin indexes the code base, obviously, building a representation of the code base and learning it and improving it over time is one of the big things that Devin does. Funnily enough, we found that naturally humans really are interested to understand this code base representation as well.

(00:40:38):
Devin Wiki is something that we built here and you can take a look at all these different pieces and see each of these different things. Here are the FP8 operations, here's an SG [inaudible 00:40:46] integration. There's diagrams of how the different layers are built and put together. There's deployment operations. There's a lot of details about the architecture as well. You can ask questions about it as well. For example, you can say, "How does DeepSeek handle multi-token prediction designed for spec deck?" It'll go through and it's able to search through the entire code base and give you an informed answer based off of that. 

(00:41:10):
We use this a lot. It helps when you're scoping out a task for Devin and doing an initial prompt. It also helps, obviously just in a vacuum, you often have questions about your code base that are really nice.

(00:42:21):
Something that I've learned as I've been talking to more and more AI building companies and apps is there's a big difference in how large of a code base they could integrate into. That's a big deal for companies that are existing versus startups, people that have large existing code base. How should people think about what kind of code base Devin can plug into?

Scott Wu (00:42:41):
Yeah. We go all the way to the biggest code base as possible. One way I'd kind of put it is how... The way that we as engineers would think about a large code base is certainly when you're making changes or when you're thinking about a particular task. You're not bringing in every single line of the code base at once. You have a high level of traction that you're able to think about and look into and then you're obviously able to zoom in and get to higher resolution on each of these different things. Devin works in much the same way, where the first thing it'll do is it's going to figure out the high level architecture of what's going on here and what this is built for and so on. But within each of the components, it's obviously also going to be able to zoom in and give some more detail about each of these. Here's FP8 to be float 16 and how exactly a lot of that is set up. Here's each of the different parts of the code base. Similarly, we built this to be scalable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):
It's essentially coming back to the engineer as architect. Now, it's helping you understand the architecture, kind of circling back to that.

Scott Wu (00:43:46):
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. One of the fun use cases that we've seen actually with folks is they'll often actually get Devin's help to onboard new engineers on the team. When you're new and you're joining, there's obviously a lot of questions that you have about the code base or about how things are set up. It also sometimes can be a little bit awkward to ask your mentor or your manager the questions and if you're worried that they're going to be really dumb questions. It's nice to just be able to ask Devin and to go through Devin's wiki and to understand these internal representations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:15):
I think that's really interesting, because it comes back to your point that Devin is not just a junior engineer. It's what you call a jagged engineer.

Scott Wu (00:44:21):
A jagged intelligence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):
A jagged intelligence, where it's almost like a staff engineer at understanding the code base. Usually, you have to ask an engineer that's been there a long time, " What does this do? Where is this thing? How does this work?" It feels like Devin's very good at that.

Scott Wu (00:44:34):
Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, the retrieval and processing a lot of code and a lot of tokens at once is something that language models are really great at. Basically being able to get those gains in the places that you need them is really great. Yeah. Sweet, cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
All right. You got a couple more use?

Scott Wu (00:44:51):
Yeah. One last thought I'll show is just... We just rolled this out last week actually, but it's a full Devin automation setup with Linear. If you have tasks that you're doing on the DeepSeek repository, for example, and it's all set up, all you have to do is you just add the Devin label and Devin will come through and it'll give you this. It's going to give you its thoughts on what the tasks looks like and you can take a look at each of the particular files that you see, or it'll point out snippets that it thinks are important. From there, if you feel good about what was built or the conclusions that we came to, then you can just start off the Devin session that will go and actually do that work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:30):
That is insane. That sounds like such a simple idea, but essentially what you're saying is there are tasks in Linear that are fixes and features and now Devin just goes off and can just do them for you.

Scott Wu (00:45:44):
Yeah. Definitely it's a hands-on process. You certainly want to be involved when Devin is scoping out the task or giving you its thoughts. The nice thing, too, by the way, is Devin will give you its confidence level. Here's how likely I am to really understand this piece or that piece or whatever, but it helps make things a lot faster. To your point, a lot of product managers, for example, obviously love to be able to use Devin in Linear to understand the code base better or things like that. Claire Vo, for example, from LaunchDarkly is a big Devin user and she loves basically going and scoping out tasks or asking data questions or asking, "Hey, what's going on? Or is this merged into production yet? Or is this a feature flag right now? Or what percent of people are getting this or that feature?" It's a clean way basically to make that intelligence much more accessible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:40):
I love, just with the integration with Linear, that you can still keep it really simple. You add a little ticket like, "Hey, this link to this home page, do this," and Devin will be really good at understanding what you mean and then show you, "Here's what I'm thinking." Is this right?

Scott Wu (00:46:53):
Yeah. Yeah, cool. Okay. Yeah, Devin did finish working. It seems like there's something going on with the CI and it's debugging that right now, but it went ahead and put up the initial first pass pull request and we can take a look. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):
Let's do it.

Scott Wu (00:47:06):
This is the Devin website, obviously, in this custom deploy and we have Lenny's newsletter right here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:11):
Let's ship this to production. We won't be so confused.

Scott Wu (00:47:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
That's amazing. Okay. Show it again real quick. Just added it to the home page of Devin.

Scott Wu (00:47:22):
Yeah. Devin, obviously, has access to our Devin code base. It does a lot here and so it's super familiar with all the pieces here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):
Beautiful.

Scott Wu (00:47:29):
Yeah, I like how that looks. We've got Devin search, we got Devin [inaudible 00:47:33], and we've got Lenny's newsletter. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
[inaudible 00:47:34]. You link to my site. We'll get some PageRank going. 

Scott Wu (00:47:37):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):
Okay. Is that a good example? Oh, there it is. What a beautiful website for my newsletter. Is that just a good example of the kind of thing Devin is very good at like, "Here's a very specific thing to change on the website"? How does your people think about what Devin is very good at and maybe where it starts to fall apart?

Scott Wu (00:47:55):
The way that we often describe it is, I think, Devin is best when it is working on tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it, you might...

Scott Wu (00:48:00):
On tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it is, you want to be giving Devin tasks, not problems. And a lot of these things like what you just saw, which was kind of like a quick front-end feature request or a bug fix or adding testing and documentation or things like that.

(00:48:16):
One of the things that makes a loop really nice obviously is a quick way to iterate and test. And so with something like this, obviously super easy for us, for example, to just go pull up the preview and see that the link worked. Obviously it would be easy for Devin to do as well. Devin will often go and log in to Devin and start a Devin session and make sure when it's working on our code base, which is kind of hilarious. But yeah, you generally want something that is kind of easy to verify and easy to test is the main thing. And you can work on bigger projects or bigger asks as well, obviously. But in that case you should certainly expect to need to steer Devin more to make sure it's going the right direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
It's interesting because that's very similar to the way people talk about synthetic data and reinforcement learning, creating data that's very easy. There's a very definitive answer, yes and no.

Scott Wu (00:49:04):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
It's very clear.

Scott Wu (00:49:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):
Okay. Let me ask you this question. What's something that you guys debated a lot as you were designing and building Devin?

Scott Wu (00:49:15):
I'll give a couple that comes to mind. One I would say is a question of, I'll call it how opinionated we should be. We had the workflows that we used to Devin for, which was very much as you can see for basically integrating to our Slack and GitHub making pull requests for us in our repos, responding to issue reports or things like that. And naturally we've had certainly a lot of other different things that have come up that folks have tried. I mean, we have folks who order their DoorDash with Devin, for example. Even we have folks, certainly a lot of people who are building cool websites from scratch or working on things like that.

(00:49:53):
Yeah, I mean it is been an interesting trade off for us where I think the way that I would describe it is in our product, certainly the large bulk of the features that we build are for this kind of making pull requests and engineering teams use case. But I think basically our kind of general stance with all the others is obviously if folks want to use Devin for that, that's great and we want to just make sure that they're fully aware about the limitations and about where things can get caught up.

(00:50:20):
It is funny with AI and especially because I would say one of, I would say the most common pieces of advice out there I would say is focus on a really niche cohort. Do things that don't scale, make one use case that's really great and then you grow from there. And I think that's great advice across the board. But yeah, it's kind of interesting because I think with generative AI, you naturally see this where a lot of product experiences can turn out to be more general. And so it's an interesting trade-off for us. This is something that we still always go back and forth on and how much do we want to do more to support all the other kind of use cases out there to handle other things that folks might want to do with Devin.

(00:51:03):
I think another one that comes to mind is how much Devin should be, let's say a single comprehensive project experience versus a suite of tools. And as you can see here, we have Devin search, we have Devin Wiki, we have the linear ticket scooping, and certainly these tools interact with each other, but I think as time has gone on, we've seen it more and more as really building this suite of tools. And I think the core agent experience and the core kind of agent that will go off and build each of these build things for you, for example, is always of course going to be that's Devin, and that is the core piece. I think that will always be what's really special about our work. But I think that all of the other features out there, there is a complex suite of work that's required for real-world software sharing and engineering is just messy at the end of the day.

(00:51:55):
And so I think there are a lot of different flows and a lot of different use cases that makes sense. And an obvious thing to point out is you could ask the same questions to Devin search as you could to Devin and Devin will go through and it'll do the same thing. It'll go through and look through the files and give you an answer and stuff.

(00:52:10):
But with that said, on the one hand, I think on the capability side, there's certainly a lot you can do to really optimize things for very specifically question answer about this repository and that made sense to really build into a specific kind feature.

(00:52:23):
And then on the other side, I would say we found that users actually really, really like having this access of control. Sometimes you have a task that you're thinking about, but you actually don't want Devin to get started on the task just yet. You want to ask Devin and understand what parts of the code base might be relevant. And so you want to be very direct about saying, "This is just an ask and I just want to see the snippets of the code base that relate," or, "I just want to look at the Wiki and understand the existing representation."

(00:52:50):
And so it's on both the capabilities and on the UX side, we've found that that's kind of what's naturally made sense over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:58):
Well, let's talk about the landscape then of just other companies in the space, which is something a lot of people are always thinking about. There's all these different approaches. You guys are going full on AI engineer, there's obviously ID companies. There's also just models being built that are really good at engineering. Everyone's kind of starting to build agents now. You guys are ahead on this in a lot of ways. OpenAI just recently said they're going to build a software engineering agent. Anthropics got something there. Cursor and Windsurf have their only agents and Replit. Thoughts on just where you guys fit in the landscape and then how do you think you win long term. How do you think about that?

Scott Wu (00:53:31):
Yeah, and for what it's worth, I think all of these are incredible teams. I think really smart and really forward-thinking folks who are building a lot of great products out there. And I think there's a lot to do honestly over the next few years with the advent of AGI or whatever you want to call it. I think one of the quotes that I love is in 2017, if you asked if we had AGI, the answer is no. And in 2025, if you ask if we have AGI, the answer is, "Well, you have to define AGI. And it depends on your subject." And I think it does get to the point of, I mean there is a lot of really amazing stuff happening. I think that it's easy to underrate, I would say just how big of a shift it is that we're seeing where I think there are a lot of great products out there, for example, over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, that have made each of these different niches of the life cycle of building a product a little bit easier, for example, right?

(00:54:28):
There's great products out there for instant response, there's great products out there for logging, there's great products out there for billing, there's all of these different tools. And the obvious thing is what we're seeing with AI is all of these spaces are going to be moving multiple times faster and it's going to be like an order of magnitude shift, if anything.

(00:54:47):
And so I think from our perspective, we've obviously had a very specific lens that we've bet on this whole time, and that is autonomous coding agents. And there's a lot of problems to solve there, to be honest, right? There's still a ton to do on the core capabilities, certainly, and we see cases all the time where it's like, wow, why did Devin make that decision? That seems, no human engineer would've ever done that. There's all sorts of spots where, with the product interface, there's obviously a lot to think about.

(00:55:16):
And I think it's by the way, not just a single thing that we're working towards, but something that will change with every edition of capabilities. I kind of think of it as there's 20 generations of agent product, agent coding experiences to come. I think the one that we'll get to over the course of several years is probably something where you don't even look at the code at all, right? And you're actually just looking at your own product and you're just able to look and specify and say, "Hey, this button should be a little bit rounder. Let's do that. And by the way, let's add a new tab here and maybe we should save this information. Let's start up a database table and let's index it on X, Y, and Z columns." And you're just basically working with your products in real time and having your agent build out those things for you. Obviously there's going to be a lot of generations in between here and there, but I think the product experience itself is going to change every single time.

(00:56:04):
And then obviously there, there's all of the practicality of just getting it out there in the world. And so folks obviously need to learn how to use the new technology. There's a lot to do to deploy into all of the messiness of real world software. There's a lot of COBOL out there still. There's a lot of FORTRAN out there still. There's lots of kind of abstractions and details that folks have done.

(00:56:27):
And so I think from our perspective, we have since the beginning have been laser-focused on agentic coding, and that is the one thing that we've really believed in. It's the one thing that we've designed for and that goes all the way to even the revenue model with ACUs and having the usage-based setup. It does into obviously all the product experiences of thinking how, okay, where do you want to talk to Devin? You want to be able to talk to Devin in Slack, you want to be able to spin this up from your issue. You want to be able to all of these things and then of course the capabilities.

(00:56:58):
And so I don't think there's any one easy answer. I think it's obviously a combination of things, but this has been the space that we've lived in and spent all of our time in for the last year and a half, and it's going to be that way for the next five or 10 years too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:14):
Along these lines, a big question everyone always has in AI's moats and defensibility, it's a question I've been asking every founder that comes on. How do you just think about how to build a moat in this space when it's so much easier to build and so much is built on these models that are themselves advancing so quickly?

Scott Wu (00:57:30):
I'd give one slight tweak on that, which is I think it's often less about moats and more about stickiness. And what I mean by that is moats are in some sense, typically what folks mean by moats is something that means that a competitor couldn't even enter the market. And I agree that at a high level, a lot of different folks at different layers of the AI spectrum, the foundation labs or the application layer or so on, I don't think there's any kind of hard barrier that would prevent others from entering. I think what does exist is stickiness, which I would kind of define as once you have a product experience that you really like, are you excited to keep using that experience or is there an effect where it is just as easy from now on to just switch on to a new one and learn a new one and so on.

(00:58:15):
And I think from that perspective, I think there's a few things that are really great about coding agents in particular. One I would say is there is a lot of just inherent stickiness and learning and buildup over time, which is that as you use Devin and as your whole team uses Devin, it's the same thing with an engineer. If you're joining on day one versus you've been at the company for five years, you wrote half the code yourself, you've touched every file you've built every single piece, you know all the engineers. And so similarly, it's like Devin will really learn and build its representation of your code base and of your stack and of your process over time and will be able to do a lot more with that.

(00:58:51):
And then the other piece of it, which I think is really exciting I'd say is there really is a lot to do of what I would call a multiplayer aspect of code, which if you think about it, is how a lot of things get done in the real world, certainly. And so it's one thing to have your own experience, which you use yourself as just an engineer, but for example, ourselves, we see this all the time where some engineers are working with Devin and teaching Devin things and as I mentioned, folks will have Devin on board their new engineers and kind of convey that knowledge to them.

(00:59:24):
Or similarly, it's like I'll start a session with Devin in Slack and I'll say, "Hey, it'd be cool if we could do this thing." And some other engineer will chime in and say, "Oh, by the way, the reason we did it initially was X and Y." And so Devin, just make sure when you do this change that you still support that workflow. And Devin will say, "Okay, sounds great." Or Devin will make a PR, I'll be working with Devin, we'll make pull requests and GitHub and somebody else will be reviewing that PR or give some comments and Devin will work on that too. You'll be in linear.

(00:59:52):
So all these kind of spaces, it really does just kind of set up for an experience basically where Devin can just grow in the value that it can provide for your whole work over time. And so I think from that perspective, if anything, we want there to be a lot of innovation and a lot of new products and so on. I don't think that the goal is to try to lock other people out of building. There's a lot of stuff to build, and I think there's going to be a lot of different experiences. I think from our perspective, what we think about is more like how can we make Devin more and more and more useful as you're using it more?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
It's very similar. We had Michael from Cursor, the CF Cursor on the podcast, and he had a similar point of just he thinks moats are just kind of like consumer, like Google is the way, he thinks it's like Google where people can easily switch. You just have to stay the best, and that's the answer. And it feels like you're adding to that of just like, but also if you can create some stickiness where it is very hard to leave because it's so good at what it's doing and it's built knowledge and integrated to your workflows and builds on that on that stickiness.

Scott Wu (01:00:58):
Yeah, and I think one of the things that's nice about our space too is, software engineering for better for worse has a very clear tie to value. And what it means is, I guess one way to put it is there is always kind of a clear next level, at least for the next while. I think there could be some point where you're just like, "All right, just build the entirety of YouTube for me." And Devin just does the whole, it's like there's probably been a hundred million hours of human engineering time building YouTube, building the algorithm, building all the infrastructure, all of the, everything, every little detail. And maybe there's some time where Devin just does that out of the box. That's obviously going to be a long time from now.

(01:01:36):
I think on the interim, on every level in between, obviously it makes a difference the quality of software engineering. And I think one of the cool things with developers obviously is developers are really willing to learn new experiences and to put in effort if it means that they're able to have a higher and higher quality experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):
Awesome. I'm going to spend a little time on the tech that enables Devin. Without divulging trade secrets, just what allowed you to make Devin so good? Was there an unlock with a certain model? Some folks have shared three points on a 3.5 was a huge unlock for a lot of their products. Just what's kind of the key to the way you've architected or built Devin that makes it work so well?

Scott Wu (01:02:20):
We obviously, we've been betting on agents for a long time. I think that agents were doable and workable a lot earlier than most folks might've thought. But certainly I think as the community has really rallied around it, I mean you see the impacts of that in the pre-training, you see the impacts of that in a lot of the work that's done with these models. I actually don't think there's been any, from our perspective, I don't think there's been any single step function based model shift or anything that has been kind of like a night and day difference in Devin, but I certainly think that the curve of every point on the chart, I mean there's a new model that comes out every week now has obviously made a big difference in terms of what we've been able to do. And then obviously on top of that, we work with the research teams at all these foundation labs to do a lot of our work on top.

(01:03:11):
And so I think that my hot take here at which I would give is, I think in terms of base intelligence, we're honestly basically already there. And I think a lot of what we see actually and what we spend our time on is less so, obviously, we don't our own models or things like that. It's less so increasing the base IQ of a model, for example, and more about teaching it all of the idiosyncrasies of real-world engineering and thinking about here's how you use Datadog and do this, and here's how you might diagnose this error and here are the different things that you could run into and here's how you handle each of those. And when you're ready, here's how you make GitHub PR.

(01:03:50):
And this is true in engineering. It's true in every other space as well. I mean, there's so much detail and idiosyncrasy to the work that we all do obviously day to day. And a lot of it is kind of like teaching the model to mirror the complexity of the real world, I would say, rather than getting it to some higher fundamental level of problem solving, which I think the foundation labs are doing a really great job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
There's something you shared when we were chatting before we started recording around the growth of previous transformative technologies were very hardware oriented and there was a limiting factor to their growth and AI is not that. Can you just share that insight?

Scott Wu (01:04:30):
For a number of reasons? I think AI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, but I think one thing, which is what we were just talking about before this, which is most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, I mean, I'm thinking about personal computer and the internet and the mobile phone and stuff, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. And so you had the internet, and initially it was just these universities that were talking with one another, but obviously over time we got the whole world plugged into the internet and it took years and years and years. Same thing was true with mobile phones. Same thing was true with PC.

(01:05:06):
And the thing that's interesting about that in particular, which is I would say we're already seeing the effects of that, is in these hardware distribution machines, obviously there's a lot that depends on real time. And so folks who were building for those industries saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, as the number of people connected to the internet increased. And many of those businesses, it's still crazy to think, but many of those businesses got started right in the beginning. I mean, Apple and Microsoft were started right around the same time. And same is true for a lot of the great internet businesses or wherever, but certainly it was something that touched whole world with time or a large fraction of the whole world. And it had a really massive impact, but it took place over several years because of the time that it took. And I think one of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. Once AI could, and I think we're firmly past the inflection point in AI code where it's, as an engineer, if you're not using AI at all to write code, I mean you're falling behind honestly. And it is a technology that everyone should have and should be using, and there's no kind of weight on hardware distribution that is causing that. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Michael Ballin has this interesting point that cliches are cliches because they're so true and that's why they're cliches. I heard that a million times and I think it's like people hear this like, "Yeah, yeah, I know," but it's actually insane what is happening. That's why you're here to help us through this transition.

Scott Wu (01:06:52):
Yeah, no, I mean, it is a fun time and I think there will be real investment and real work that it takes. But I think from the perspective of us as engineers, for example, I think it just means it's so important to stay in the loop with everything that's happening. And as we're seeing it's not only because of your learning and your ability to work these technologies, but it's also about basically teaching the AI what there is to know about your code base in order to make it really effective at building with you and doing more of the things that you would want it to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):
So along those lines, for people listening that they're like, "Hey, we should be using Devin at our company," what are things you've found to be helpful in helping an engineer at a company get adoption and be able to use Devin either culturally or logistically?

Scott Wu (01:07:42):
So a pattern which we often see with folks is there will be a few folks at the team who are really excited and want to try out the new thing, and they want to put in the investment and are really excited to get it going. And they'll go through all the setup. They'll give Devin the repos, they'll teach Devin how to run the lint and the CI and all of those details. And they'll start off by giving it those initial tasks and help Devin build a foothold basically. And as time goes on, eventually folks will see, "Wow, Devin's writing all these PRs, Devin's doing this [inaudible 01:08:14].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
Who's this Devin person that just joined the company's just knocking out PRs?

Scott Wu (01:08:17):
Yeah. And they'll see that, and then naturally they'll get on and they'll get an account. And one of the cool things of course is by the time they join, Devin already knows a good amount of detail about the repositories that they're already working in and they're working with that. And so one of the really cool things which we often see is that the early adopters themselves can really pave the way I think, for everyone else on the team.

(01:08:37):
But yeah, I think the main thing I would just kind of call out is it really does take, it's a very different product experience, and I think for what it's worth, I think there's still a lot more that we can do to make it as intuitive and as clear as possible to folks like how to use Devin and what the right steps are and how to really maximize value out of Devin. But I think that, yeah, it's the kind of thing where if you put in the investment and understand exactly what it takes to get Devin to be successful, we've found ourselves that as time has gone on, we just use Devin more and more and more with every next update.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
So let me follow that thread. There is a question I ask every AI app building founder, which is, if you could sit next to every new user of Devin and whisper something in their ear to help them be successful with Devin, one or two tips, what would those tips be?

Scott Wu (01:09:31):
I think the biggest thing I would say is it really is just treat Devin like your new junior engineer. And I think that's the biggest thing. I think folks come in and they see the blank page and they think of all sorts of various things that they want to try out. They think of lots, where I think typically the flow that we see that works best is obviously you can try demos and you can do things, but a lot of it is just like, "Yeah, let's figure out what tickets we want to get done today or this week and let's have Devin get started on those and let's start with the easier ones and then work with Devin and understand what things Devin needs to get set up to be able to test its own code and do this well. And then let's scale up over time." And then obviously as you work with your engineer, you understand better how to communicate with them or what are the right tasks or projects to bring them in on. But I think that really is the one-liner for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:31):
Okay. There's a question I'd be meeting task. I just want to get back to this because it's something I think a lot about with Devins. Everyone's going to have five Devins, let's say 10 Devins. Everyone's kind of turning into basically an engine manager with a bunch of junior engineers, which isn't necessarily the best job in the world because it's just a bunch of, at least you don't have to do performance reviews and one-on-ones, but it's sitting around, checking a lot of PRs all day. There's a sense of you become an architect, which is kind of what every engineer wants to become eventually, right? They're all, "I just want to think about the architecture. I don't want to code all these stupid, fix bugs."

(01:11:06):
So I get that there's a good side to that, but just I imagine you're thinking a lot about this, just like how do you make life pleasant and fun and enjoyable as basically an engine manager of say, 500 Devins in the future?

Scott Wu (01:11:19):
Yeah, I can just imagine the performance, "Devin, you've done a really great job on your task, but I really would like you to be more proactive in the team meetings." So what I'd say-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):
[inaudible 01:11:29].

Scott Wu (01:11:29):
It's funny actually because something that in terms of the wording that we thought a lot about as well is just, we've used the term manager of Devins in the past, which of course I think is a big part of it. But I think that the only thing I would point out here is I think that the bricklayer versus architect is closer to the experience than being a manager. Because I think a lot of the difficulty of management or the reason that people shy away from it is more because of a lot of the various.

Scott Wu (01:12:00):
... [inaudible 01:12:00] because of a lot of the various, let's say... There's all of the context, and the ownership, and the responsibility and stuff, and then there's also all of the emotional aspects of it. Where, I think working with Devin is a little more like just being, more as having an interface to hand off tasks and build tasks. And so, the parallel that I would draw is when we invented Python, obviously... It's like, in many ways the description and the outlining of tasks, obviously it was a different paradigm, but I think certainly it was nowhere near what folks typically think of as management bureaucracy today.

(01:12:50):
And I think that with Devin, a lot of it is just like, it's more like finding the right levels of abstraction that you could work with Devin on, and just finding the workflows that work really well, and the obvious thing to say here is, it's like you can always have Devin take a first pass at things. And so you have Devin take the first pass, if it's great, you merge it right away, if it needs some touch up, you can obviously give that feedback, for example, but a lot of it is like, it's more about, basically making Devin part of your flow than it losing control, which I think is the main thing that folks are scared of with management.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
Are you thinking about a manager Devin? Like a Devin that manages other Devins?

Scott Wu (01:13:37):
Yeah, yeah. So, for what it's worth, Devin can start other Devins through the API, right? And so, we've seen this happen quite a bit of times, where naturally if you have some big tasks that you want to do, Devin will do this all the time, it'll chunk up and then [inaudible 01:13:53] into smaller Devins. And so, it's the kind of thing that you need to give Devin the credentials to be able to do that, it's not currently something that is default enabled, but I can certainly imagine as time goes on that there's more and more of that

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):
Devins all the way down.

Scott Wu (01:14:05):
Yeah, yeah. I think the thing that's kind interesting too is, with humans, the way I almost say it, in technical terms, it's like there's this coupling of a context and a thread, and what I mean by that is basically, each human can only operate a single threaded on the work that they do, and they have their set of context, and then there's other humans obviously who can do other stuff at the same time, but they have their own context. With agents, one of the cool things is you can have an agent that's doing multiple lines of exploration at once, but is sharing all of the context of everything that they find, and so I think that this is very early, and I think we'll see this, but folks obviously love to talk about basically systems of agents communicating with one another, and I think that there will be a lot of new paradigms to build for, once we get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):
And it's so interesting what you said about the decision between having one Devin and only one Devin do all the things, and you just tell them things and they fire off jobs versus you have five Devins, and they're each doing individual things, it's such an interesting decision to make.

Scott Wu (01:15:10):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:12):
Okay, two more questions. Maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far building Devin, that maybe goes against startup wisdom, common startup wisdom?

Scott Wu (01:15:21):
Something I've thought about a lot lately as we've built this is, this is not my first company, actually for a lot of us, it's not our first company, I think of our 26 or 27 people total on the team, I think 18 of us have started our own company before this. And yeah, one of the things I think about is, there's actually your point about cliches I think really spoke to me as well, which is, there's the really common things which you hear all the time in startups, where you're like, you got to move fast, or you got to hire great people, it's like, okay, well, obviously you do, I wasn't planning on not hiring great people, I wasn't planning on going slow. And similarly it's like, yeah, you really got to build something that people want. And there's these three to five things which are always repeated, and they're always the common wisdom in startups.

(01:16:11):
And I definitely had this idea as a founder, when I was starting initially, that, all right, so those are the three to five basic things, but as you get really deep into it, you spend a lot of years into it, you learn all of the thousands of other things that you have to learn to build a company. And I think to some extent that's, of course, true, and there's lots of little details that you'll get into with all these different things, including team building, and product, and strategy, and engineering decision-making, and fundraising, and sales, and every other component. But I also realized that as time has gone on, more and more, I felt like building companies well sometimes just comes down to doing those three to five things just even more than you could possibly expect.

(01:16:58):
And so, with us, it's like... And everyone says we go fast, but it's like, yeah, we had a hackathon in November, we had another hackathon in December, we started the company officially in January, we got the prototypes out to initial users in February, we did a launch in March, we got our first customers in April... It's just like, basically truly pushing the pace in every spot where we possibly could has really made a difference for us. And similarly, it's like, yeah, everyone always says you should hire great people, but I think that the truth within that truth is basically you should fight to all ends basically, to get the folks that you really want to bring in. And one of my favorite stories to share is we had a candidate who came and interviewed, he was a junior at MIT, so he was very, very young, and we gave him an interview, and he did way better than almost any of the full-time candidates that we had ever talked to. And so, we said, hey, what do you think about taking some time off of school and working with us and building out Devin?

(01:17:57):
We really think you're just going to be able to come in and just have a ton of impact already from day one. And he thought about it for a while, and he came back and he said, you know what? I'm down, I want to do it, but my parents really want me to graduate from school, and I'm just not sure there's a way to make it work. And so, we talked him more and just understood the situation, and then we flew to North Carolina, went straight from the airport to his parents' house, had dinner with him and his parents, we talked a lot, a really nice Gujarati family, we gave them some gifts and just talked to them about it, and try to understand what would it take, and what would we need to make work. And they just said, it sounds like a great opportunity, but we really want our son to be able to graduate.

(01:18:45):
And we talked that through and we figured out a setup basically, where he could work for us essentially full time, but then come in for his required classes, and do what he needed to do to get the diploma basically, but no more than that. And we talked that through, and then we got to a point where everyone was happy with that, and then went straight back to the airport and flew right back, basically. And that was the first and only time that I've ever been in North Carolina, and it was just a great trip. And it is the kind of thing where it's like, hiring great people is one thing, but truly just never giving up, and really giving it everything that you can to make it work for people who really makes sense to be on the team. And he's been with us on the team for over a year now, and he's been an incredible, incredible engineer, and we wouldn't be here without him.

(01:19:31):
And similarly, we had someone else who was again, really, really talented candidate, did amazingly well, very young, and had a lot of great offers at a lot of other companies, and we were talking to them about, he wanted to start his own company someday as well, and we were talking to him about certainly a lot of the obvious things, which are having him meet our investors, or get to do work with customers, or see a lot of these other components so that when the time came that he would have all the experience he needed to start his own company. But one of the other things that was big is he was talking with a lot of great companies already, he didn't want to burn any bridges, and so we actually worked with him and basically hand wrote all of his rejection responses to each of the other companies, and worked with him on it to say, here's how you should say it in a way that's going to come off as that you really did appreciate the time with them, and that obviously you want to remain close with them and stay in touch. And it was the kind of thing obviously where it's like, look, obviously our job is to make sure that he's happy enough that he doesn't want to leave at any time in the near future, but I think it's the kind of thing where the way that you put together a really, really great team is by fighting for what's right for them too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):
Wow, those are incredible stories. And it makes so real these, as you say, cliches, hire the best people, this is what it sounds like to hire the best people. This is what it takes.

Scott Wu (01:20:56):
Yeah, no, and I was just saying, a lot of things we've fought very hard to just reimagine things from the ground up because a lot of it really is just thinking about where do we think the technology is going over the next five, 10 years, and what is the place that we want to have in that future?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
I wonder if people are going to be fighting for the best Devin someday. They're just going to [inaudible 01:21:19] Devins.

Scott Wu (01:21:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):
They're [inaudible 01:21:22] so smart.

Scott Wu (01:21:22):
I'll give you overtime pay, benefits, free healthcare, and everything, and then the Devin's like...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:29):
Three Devins like Magic: The Gathering cards.

Scott Wu (01:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):
And then just going back to your three to five things. So, essentially this is incredible advice, essentially, it's like you always hear hire the best people, move fast, build things people want.

Scott Wu (01:21:41):
Yeah, build something people want, stay as close as possible to your customers, and then I think the other thing is just always think about where things are going, not where they are today. I feel like those are the five things, which is... Especially in AI, with things moving so fast, and there's so much great talent, I feel like a lot of these are even more true, where it's like it's not just thinking about where things are going to be in 10 years, it's like thinking about what's going to happen next week. And obviously, things are moving very quickly, and it is very hard to predict, but you really have to be very rigorous with yourself, I'd say, about thinking through those things and evaluating all of the decisions that you make in that lens.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:25):
And staying focused is the big takeaway to me here, is it ends up feeling like there's 1000 things you should do, but it's always these five things.

Scott Wu (01:22:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):
Scott, we covered a lot of ground. We went through every question I had, which is great, is there anything else that you want to share? Anything else you want to leave your listeners with, maybe a final nugget or something really you want to double down on that we said before we let you go?

Scott Wu (01:22:49):
The biggest thing that comes to mind for me is there's a lot of different perceptions about AI, right? I think basically every emotion under the sun right now. There's a lot of fear, for example, there's also a lot of skepticism, and we're very skeptical types as well, and we always wanted to try it ourselves to really see it and believe it. And I think the main thing that comes to mind for me, is I'm honestly really optimistic about what we're building here with AI, not just with code and with Devin, but the whole space, and everything that's getting done. And I think one of the cool things that is really actively happening is just the ability for everyone to multiply themselves, and that's how we've always thought about it, it's how we've thought about what we're building. And I think there is a lot more to do out there in the world, I'm not too worried about us running out of things to do, and from that lens, I think that the thing that we've always been most excited about is, how can we all do more?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
I hear you Scott. Well, with that optimism, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Scott Wu (01:23:59):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:00):
Okay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Scott Wu (01:24:07):
In terms of nonfiction, I think for folks in startups, I think one of the things that I've really enjoyed is just learning and understanding the history of Silicon Valley. And it's all of these things that we think about, somebody invented them. It's one of the great realizations I feel like, is somebody invented the idea of a seed route, somebody invented the idea of venture capital, somebody invented the idea of product-market fit, and all of these different principles that we talk about. And so, for that, there's a book called The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby, which I really like. And basically, it's just a tour of many of the great businesses and the great products that have been built over the last 60, 70 years in Silicon Valley, which I really love. I think in terms of fiction, I actually have always really liked The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, it's one of my personal favorites as a fiction book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Scott Wu (01:25:01):
I have to admit, I have not watched... I can't think of a single movie or TV show that I have watched in the last while, so I'm sure, I'm looking forward to watching a lot of great ones post-AGI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):
That's got to be in the trailer, that's great, I like that. And that just shows how hard you're working, just how much shit is going on, and how fast everything's moving. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical, could be a toothbrush.

Scott Wu (01:25:32):
One I would say is I got an Aura frame recently, it's just like a frame that shows photos, and you can show a new photo every day, or every hour, or every 15 minutes, or whatever you like. I've actually, I've really enjoyed it a lot, I think it's a nice way to basically just have a picture frame memories that come up. And then, the other thing I would say as a general purpose thing, it's not particularly new, but I would say, I think AirPods are extremely well-built and well-designed. And I realize now that it's like, I basically use them for all... I'm taking calls on a walk and I'm using AirPods, obviously I'm doing work at my computer, at my desk, I'm plugged into AirPods, and it works quite well, honestly, for a lot of different situations, and they're very comfortable, they're very consistent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:21):
I'm going to double down on the Aura frame, I also, I got one of these for my mom and my mother-in-law, and they're so great for just sharing photos of your kids with your family. And people have, they've heard of digital picture frames, but the Aura just does it really well, and it's really easy to add photos, and they're just really nice looking.

Scott Wu (01:26:39):
You can imagine not that long from now, we'll have the Aura Frame except Studio Ghiblifies every photo that you have in it, and then it's... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:47):
Or just imagines things you've done that are really cool. Look at my sweet life. Yeah. Cool. And it's Aura, it's A-U-R-A, I believe is how you spell it. Folks who want to check it out, we'll link to it. Not affiliated. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Scott Wu (01:27:06):
Yeah, something I've thought about a lot is a lot of the proverbs out there are actually contradictions, right? It's like birds of a feather, and then you also have opposites attract, and you have all... And it's kind of funny, because you feel that both of them are true, and often they both are true, and a lot of it is about understanding why. And one of those that I feel like, especially in the world of startups that I think about all the time is, I think it is very important to be focused and driven, and to really maximize your potential, and then at the same time, it's also very important to not let your own personal emotion get tied up in your success or failure, and I think especially with startups, because there's always ups and downs, honestly, even in the most successful companies ever, it's just like, it's a rocky road, there's a lot that happens, and a lot that goes down.

(01:28:03):
And I think one of the things which I've thought a lot about is that somehow you really want to do your best, and put everything you can into it, and do everything you can to... Basically, you want to put it all out on the field. But at the same time, you want to be okay with both wins and losses, and you want to be able to move on, and go into the next one each time. And something, yeah, it's funny, but what I've found personally is that obviously it's really important for your own emotional state and mental state to be able to do that, and we've had lots of mistakes, and I've had a lot.

(01:28:49):
I had my first company, which obviously, which was cool, but there are a lot of tricky spots there, and then over the course of Cognition, it feels like it's been already eight years compressed into one year, and it's still going at that pace. But somehow it also actually makes you more successful, I think, too. It's like, you are just more able to give it your best, and to do the things that will lead to success if you're not tying it up in your own personal worth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:19):
That is so interesting, I just had a podcast recording recently where with an executive coach, Jerry Kelowna, that I think will come out before this, might be after this, that's one of his big pieces of advice, and it's a very Buddhist approach of just [inaudible 01:29:33] and attaching to a certain outcome.

Scott Wu (01:29:35):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:36):
Okay. Final question, I'm curious if there's a story here, but we could keep it short, is there a story behind Devin as the name, or is there another contender for Devin being the [inaudible 01:29:48]?

Scott Wu (01:29:47):
Devin was the name from pretty early on, we were interested, we were working on coding agents from the beginning, and my co-founders are Steven and Walden, for example, and we had this idea, all right, let's get started, and let's try to expand the box as much as we can. So, have everyone think out of the box and do their own thing, and let's have everyone do their own thing first for a bit, and then we'll consolidate and take everything that we've learned. And so, Walden made a virtual developer version of him, which was called DevWalden, and then Steven made one of him, which is called DevSteven, and we had all these... And then we were kind of combining it all into one thing, and we're like, okay, you know? It's Devin. And that was the thing. And so Devin was, yeah, Devin stuck for us quite early on, I would say.

(01:30:31):
One thing which we did have a big decision on though actually is what the image of Devin would be. And so, as folks know, there's the hexagons and then people have seen this more recently, but there's actually also an otter, a little otter with a laptop in its lap, and that is Devin as well. And we had this debate over what to go with, and what not to go with and stuff, and it's been a while now, but somehow we still have both the hexagons and the otter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:01):
You skipped over where the Devin, did you have just have, it just came to you?

Scott Wu (01:31:06):
Oh, so Devin is, it's a dev. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:10):
[inaudible 01:31:10].

Scott Wu (01:31:09):
And so, it was kind of like, when we were consolidating all the names, it just seemed clear then that this would be the universal dev that we all liked to work with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):
Wow.

Scott Wu (01:31:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:18):
Incredible. Scott, this was so much fun. Oh my God, I learned a ton, which is always a really good sign. Two final questions, where can folks find you/Devin/anything else you want to point them to, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Scott Wu (01:31:29):
Awesome. Yeah, no, we're at App.devin.ai, and you can find us as well on Twitter or a lot of other social media. We'd obviously love to hear any feedback you have about the Devin product, there's so much to figure out, and I think the, like I said, I think we're all still 20 steps away from really the future of software engineering, and so it really means a lot to hear what folks think about the product as they're trying it out. And so, please let us know anytime if there's things that we can do to make it better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):
Scott, thank you so much for being here.

Scott Wu (01:32:02):
Thank you so much for having me. I had a great time.

# The original growth hacker reveals his secrets | Sean Ellis (author of “Hacking Growth”)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The Sean Ellis test, such a seemingly simple idea that has had such a profound impact on the startup world.

Sean Ellis (00:00:07):
The question is, how would you feel if you could no longer use this product? Once you got a high enough percentage of users saying they'd be very disappointed, most of those products did pretty well. If you felt too low, those products tended to suffer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
Say someone is listening and they're like, "Okay. Man, I'm getting like 10%. I don't know what to do." What do you find often works?

Sean Ellis (00:00:25):
Just ignore the people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. They're telling you it's a nice to have. If you start paying attention to what your somewhat disappointed users are telling you and then you start tweaking onboarding and product based on their feedback, maybe you're going to dilute it for your must have users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Moving retention often is really hard, but I guess it sounds like there's often something you can do.

Sean Ellis (00:00:45):
It's usually much more function of onboarding to the right user experience than it is about the kind of the tactical things that people try to do to improve retention.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
What are like three or four things that you think people should definitely try to help improve activation?

Sean Ellis (00:00:58):
In my experience-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Sean Ellis. Sean is one of the earliest and most influential thinkers and operators in the world of growth. He coined the term growth hacking, invented the ICE prioritization framework, was one of the earliest people to use freemium as a growth strategy, and maybe most famously developed the Sean Ellis test to help you understand if you have product market fit, which a large percentage of founders use today and profoundly impacted the way startups are built. Over the course of his career, Sean was head of growth at Dropbox and Eventbrite, helped companies like Microsoft and Newbank refine their growth strategy, was on the founding team of LogMeIn, which eventually sold for over $4 billion, and he's the author of one of the most popular growth books of all time called Hacking Growth. In our conversation, we dive deep into two topics. One, how to know if you've got product market fit and what to do if you don't, and two, how to figure out how to grow once you've found product market fit.

(00:01:58):
If you're in the early stages of a new product wrangling with product market fit or trying to figure out how to jumpstart or further accelerate growth for your product, this episode is for you.

(00:02:23):
Sean, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Sean Ellis (00:02:27):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm super excited to be on with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:29):
There's so much that I want to talk about. There's so many directions we can go, but to keep it focused, I want to spend time on two areas. I want to talk about how to know if you have product market fit and what to do once you have product market fit in terms of figuring out how to grow. I know these things are very linked. I know you spent a lot of time on these things. How does this feel?

Sean Ellis (00:02:49):
Sounds perfect. Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:51):
Okay. Okay, amazing. Let's talk about, first of all, the Sean Ellis test, slash something people call sometimes the product fit test. Such a seemingly simple idea that has had such a profound impact on the startup world. I've never actually seen you talk about the history of this thing, how you came up with these questions, how you came up 40%, the whole journey of this thing. So let's talk about this. But first of all, can you just tell people what is the Sean Ellis test for folks that aren't exactly familiar with this?

Sean Ellis (00:03:19):
It's a simple question that helps you figure out, does anyone consider your product a must-have, or ideally, who and how many people consider it, but ultimately it's about trying to figure out is your product a must-have, which could be equated to having product market fit. And so the question is, how would you feel if you could no longer use this product? And I give them the choice, very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, or even not disappointed or not applicable, I've already stopped using the product. And what I'm trying to find are those people who say, "I would be very disappointed if I could no longer use this product," then that's a really powerful vein to dig into when you discover that you actually have some people who would give a crap if your product disappears.

(00:05:07):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. "Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature." And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible. But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone.

(00:05:34):
CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites. And they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/LENNY and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/LENNY. And the idea is that if you, 40% or more of people, say they'd be very disappointed if they can no longer use the product, you essentially have product market fit.

Sean Ellis (00:06:40):
I would say it's a leading indicator of product market fit. The lightning indicator is, do they actually keep using it? So probably retention cohorts are more accurate, but the problem is, like your time at Airbnb, how long do you have to look at a retention cohort before you know that you've actually long-term retained someone?

(00:07:01):
And so with this question, you can kind of find out day one, you don't need a good analytics system in place to be able to see if product market fit exists. And so yeah, the 40% was not something I originally had in there. Originally, I was trying to have just a filter so that I was not treating all feedback from customers the same, but I was trying to find feedback from customers who actually really cared about the product. And then was over time, at the time I was working for a couple of YC-backed companies, and so those companies were all pretty connected, and so I would share the question with a lot of other startups in Silicon Valley. And so over time, I started to see there was a pattern that once you got a high enough percentage of users saying they'd be very disappointed, most of those very disappointed without the product, most of those products did pretty well. And then if you felt too low, those products tended to suffer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:05):
Okay, there's two things I want to definitely follow up on here. The first is such an important point that you made at the beginning when I introduced this test that you described it as a leading indicator of product market fit and actually retention, people actually using your product, the product actually being used by the market is the actual ultimate test. So the idea here is this is a good way to get a sense of, before you actually have data, are we headed in a good direction? Could you speak more about that, of like, when to use this and when it's most useful in best [inaudible 00:08:34]?

Sean Ellis (00:08:33):
Yeah. I mean, so for me in particular, when I come into a company, my goal is to help them grow. And so I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm going to fail because no one actually cares about the product. And so it can really be asked at a company of any stage. It's helpful to understand who your must have users are. But essentially once you have even an MVP, like a very first MVP on the product, you can still get some useful feedback about the product if it's resonating with anyone.

(00:09:08):
So I actually had a company where I had committed to work with them. It was right after I left Dropbox and I committed to work with these guys for six months to help them grow. I ran the question and it came back at only 7% of users saying they'd be very disappointed without the product. And so I'm like, "I have six months to help them grow and they're only at 7% right now. It might take six months to get the 40%. Am I doing them a disservice by being in a growth role and being on payroll during this period of time?" But fortunately with the signal and the information we got from the initial survey, we were able to get them at 40% in two weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:50):
Wow. What did you do there just as a case study?

Sean Ellis (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. So the company called Lookout, it's a mobile security company, and now most of the things in Lookout are built into iPhones and Androids. But at that time, the product had everything from backup my data to find my lost phone to protecting your phone with a firewall and antivirus. And so when we ran this initial survey, I dug into the 7% who said they'd be very disappointed without the product and found that most of that 7% were focused on the antivirus functionality. So they were like, they know they need to protect their computer from viruses, smartphones were becoming more like computers, so it just made a lot of sense for them that they'd need to protect their phone. And interesting, at the time, I think there was only one kind of phone virus that had ever even happened, but it was a pretty easy mental leap for people.

(00:10:50):
And so now we knew, okay, it's antivirus that people really valued. And so step one was just reposition the product on antivirus. So that kind of creates a filter. So anyone who now is coming in to sign up for the product who doesn't care about antivirus is not going to convert, and those who are excited about antivirus are going to convert. We already know from the initial survey that people value that after they convert. So by setting the right expectations around it up front, you're going to bring people in with the right expectations. But then the second thing that we did was we streamlined onboarding so that the first thing that they did after signing up for the product was to set up the antivirus and then get a message "you're now protected from viruses."

(00:11:38):
And so it's really the combination of those two things. It's set the right expectations and then speed to value. And so the next cohort of people that we surveyed were at 40% saying they'd be very disappointed without the product. So that literally took two weeks to make those changes. Six months later, it was 60% on the score. And then I think they hit the billion dollar valuation four or five years later on ultimately being one of the early unicorns.

(00:12:11):
And interestingly, as all of those things were built into mobile phones now, they've completely changed the business, but they continue to do really well, but they've continued to iterate the business. I think that having that kind of finger on the pulse early in the business was important to build the muscle in the business to be really responsive as the market changed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:35):
Sean, this is already amazing. There's just a fractal of topics I want to explore from this very short conversation already. So the first is just follow this thread of basically you're sharing kind of a growth strategy that I imagine you execute, is look for the percentage of people that would be very disappointed if your product went away, see who they are, see what they're excited about and lean into that both positioning-wise, onboarding-wise, and probably also cut out stuff from your product that they don't care about.

Sean Ellis (00:13:02):
Yeah. And I was coming at it from a marketing perspective initially. Over time, I position myself more in a growth role with product and marketing as areas I could influence. But as a marketer, I probably didn't have a lot of influence on a engineering founded company to say, "Let's cut out stuff." So it made more sense to say, "Let's just sequence the onboarding so that we're highlighting this and onboarding to this." That was a little easier to sell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):
And just hearing that you can move this score so quickly without even changing the product substantially, I imagine what surprised a lot of people when you think about moving retention often is really hard. And maybe we talk about that, but I guess it sounds like there's often something you can do that's not very hard that might significantly shift this product market fit test.

Sean Ellis (00:13:57):
Right. And then that ultimately moving retention is really hard, but it's usually much more function of onboarding to the right user experience than it is about the tactical things that people try to do to improve retention.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
Okay. I want to put a pin on that and come back to that because a really important topic. I'm going to come back to, say someone runs this survey and they get 40%, what should they have in their mind of like, "This is what this is telling me"? Because I think a lot of people are like, "I got product market fit. I got this. Let's go, go, go." What's the best way to think about what this tells you?

Sean Ellis (00:14:30):
Yeah, I mean it tells you something really important, which is, you haven't created something that people don't care about. So that's an important insight. But until you deeply understand that product market fit, you kind of don't have the tools to be able to grow the business. So that's really the next step, is to dig in and figure out who considers it a must have, how are they using the product, what did they use before, what problem are they solving.

(00:14:59):
One of my favorite questions is... So I tend to have a lot of questions that I build off of that I'm using that filter, trying to drill into the users who say they'd be very disappointed without the product, and one of my favorite questions is, "What is the primary benefit that you get?" And then I use that initially as an open-ended question to kind of crowdsource different benefits people are getting. But then I run another survey where I turn it into a multiple choice question, force them to pick one of four distinctive benefit statements. And then the question that follows on that next survey is, "Why is that benefit important to you?" And then I start to get really good context.

(00:15:43):
So I actually came up with this question when I was working with an early YC company called Xobni, which is inbox felt backwards. And when I ran that question, basically the people who said they'd be very disappointed without the product we're focused on, "Xobni helps me find things faster in my email." So it's great to know, okay, that's the benefit. But when I asked, "Why is that benefit important to you?" They said, "Oh, I'm drowning in email." I kept seeing that statement as a written statement. And so when I then was trying to figure out how to acquire customers, when I tested "drowning in email?", that set such a good hook. That was the context that people were living in, that they were really responsive to the message of find things faster with Xobni and then a description of what Xobni is. So I think when you can really dig into the context of why that must have benefit is important to people, you start to get the ingredients to build that flywheel that leads to long-term sustainable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):
So what I'm hearing is whether you have 40%, whether you have 60% or even 7%, the actual best use of this tool is look at that percentage of highly disappointed and see what they're looking for, what they're excited about.

Sean Ellis (00:17:04):
Start drilling in, start feeling back that onion-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
Start drilling in.

Sean Ellis (00:17:06):
... and just deeply understand them and make sure that ultimately your product roadmap is doubling down on the things that are important to your must-have customers. Onboarding is bringing new people to the right experience. Your messaging is setting the right expectations, your acquisition campaigns are targeting people who actually have the need. And so it's all about getting the right people to the right experience. And then even your engagement loop is about just reinforcing how to get people to experience that benefit more often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):
Awesome. And the 40% threshold, so what you shared is you basically emerged from just looking at tons of startups doing the survey and finding a pattern. How firm is that 40%? How big of a deal? Is it 39 versus 41?

Sean Ellis (00:17:53):
I don't think it's that firm. To me, I think the real power is having some kind of target for the team to be shooting for that basically says, "We're not going to aggressively start to grow until we hit this target." And I think that as just a focusing piece is really important because I think one of the biggest challenges in an early stage startup is half the people feel like we're years from having this product ready to grow, and half the people are like, "What are we waiting for?" Where if you can actually get people on the same page of what does product market fit look like for our business, and it's at that point that we're going to.

(00:18:36):
Before I ever heard the term product market fit, I remember the conversations back at LogMeIn in the mid 2000s of kind of like, "When do we step on the gas? What is the combination of factors that need to be in place before we start pouring fuel on the early fire?" And so yeah, I think that kind of nail it then scale it. It's probably been a term that's been around for decades now, but it's all kind of pointing to that same concept of product market fit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
How often have you seen false positives with this test where someone gets 40% and something is not right, they're actually far from it? Or is it generally pretty accurate?

Sean Ellis (00:19:14):
If you're having people say that they'd be very disappointed without your product, that's a really good sign. What I can tell you is that not necessarily a false positive, but what is driving people to say they'd be very disappointed. One of my favorite books is Hooked by Nir Eyal and he talks about in the kind of engagement loop that your last step is investment.

(00:19:38):
And so I ran the survey on a business that I thought was a fairly commoditized business. Part of it I wanted to see, could I use the same go-to-market approach on a later stage company and use it to accelerate growth. And so this was a business called webs.com. They eventually got acquired by VistaPrint. But they'd been pretty flat for the year before I went in there. And then I started to use this approach to try to dial in their growth engine. I ran the survey thinking, "Yeah, you've had products like Wix and Weebly that have come on to the market since this more legacy website building product has been around. I personally think they're a little easier to use, they're a little better." And so I didn't have high hopes when I ran the survey, but it came back with one of the highest scores I'd ever seen. And it was like 90% of the people saying they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):
Holy shit. I've never seen that.

Sean Ellis (00:20:39):
And I was like, "How could that be possible? This product is kind of a commoditized category. I wouldn't even say it's one of the best." And then when I want to dug into it again, it comes back to that Nir Eyal Hooked model, is that the investment people have made in building that website, they put so much into that they know exactly how to make the changes and the kind of the CMS kind of side of things, they have spent a lot of time just making it beautiful. And so ultimately it was something that that was why they were saying they'd be very disappointed.

(00:21:15):
But fast-forward when I initially went in, still doing these things help the business resume growth and have significant growth over the next 12 months after we did these things. So still the signal we got from why people would be very disappointed without the product was important and speed to value. All the other things I think about in go-to-market for an early stage product still were relevant, but just I think they were a little stronger on the percentage he'd be very disappointed.

(00:21:51):
Even Eventbrite when I was there when we ran it was probably the second highest I'd ever seen. But with event organizers, if they've already set their event up on that platform and they've sent it out to their list and all those people are coming in and they're managing their event, again, they've invested a lot in the platform. So sort of switching costs I think can factor in there. So it's a function of both switching costs and utility of the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
So that's a question I wanted to ask is, what's your guidance on when to ask this question? What I'm hearing is, if you ask it very far along the journey, when they're very invested, you'll get a much higher score. Is there any advice on the timing and the best time to ask this question to your users?

Sean Ellis (00:22:38):
What I recommend is a random sample of people who've really used your product. So they've gone in, they didn't just sign up, but they went in and hopefully hit that deviation moment. They've used it twice, two plus times, and they've ideally used it, say, within the last week or two weeks, so they haven't churned yet. So if it's a random sample of those people, that's kind of the ideal time to ask it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):
Got it. So basically it's people that have activated whatever that means to you and have been using it for a couple weeks?

Sean Ellis (00:23:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:14):
Not people landing in your home page, not people just signing up, not people months later.

Sean Ellis (00:23:19):
Not people who've seen a demo of your product, but it's people who actually have experienced the product. But it's okay if you're hitting people who've used it months later, but in that Lookout example that I gave, if I'm testing people's perception of the product after I made updates to the onboarding, I'm going to only want to survey people who went through the new onboarding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
Yep. In the experimental. Yeah. Okay. So I asked people on Twitter what to ask you. A lot of people had a lot of awesome questions. I'm going to sprinkle in a couple of these questions throughout the chat.

Sean Ellis (00:23:54):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:54):
One came in from Shraaz Doshi, a popular guest of the podcast.

Sean Ellis (00:23:59):
One of the ones that I listened to recently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:01):
Amazing. I think it's the second most popular episode behind Brian Chesky. Okay. So he had a question of just, "What are the limitations of the score? When does it break down? When should you not use it if ever?" Is there anything of just like, "Here's when it's not going to work for you"?

Sean Ellis (00:24:14):
Yeah. I think one-off products would probably, like, how would you feel if you could no longer watch the movie you just watch? I wouldn't care. Even when I run a workshop, I don't run this as part of my survey after I do a workshop because how would you feel if you could no longer attend the workshop you just attended? It doesn't make sense. So I'll ask an NPS question as my filtering question so that I'm looking at focusing in on feedback of people who love it, also then through a separate lens, looking at people maybe who would be my detractors. So I think one-off products are probably not good products to run the question on. There may be other places as well that I'm not thinking of right now, but that [inaudible 00:25:00].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
It sounds like not many. What I'm hearing is it's generally widely applicable.

Sean Ellis (00:25:04):
Yeah, I think it is, at least from my perspective. It's been really useful for me anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):
Awesome. Okay. And then the follow-up question from Shraaz is, and I kind of asked this, but I'm curious if there's anything more here, just, "Have you seen any instances of startups over relying on the score prematurely declaring product market fit when in reality they haven't reached it yet? And just are there any other caveats of like, 'Cool, I got 40%'?" Is there anything else you should know, like, " Okay. But maybe check this one thing"?

Sean Ellis (00:25:31):
Yeah, I mean, I think to me it's kind of like what really is the definition of product market fit is the definition that people who get through my crappy onboarding and actually experience the product love it. And if I'm able to retain those people, that means I have product market fit. Or, is fixing that crappy onboarding part of getting to product market fit as well? I think that's up for debate.

(00:25:55):
So to me, the hardest, I wouldn't obsess on onboarding if I know those who kind of get through the challenge of getting started with the product still don't like the product then feels like it's a core product issue or wrong people using it in the wrong way issue. But once you have that, then ultimately it doesn't mean that you're ready to grow. When I focus on growth, then customer acquisition is almost the last step. Once I validate that it's a must have for those early users, then I'm thinking about, "Okay, how do I optimize speed to value? How do I make sure that people have the right prompts to come back and use the product at the right time so that's kind of more of that engagement loop? How do I get my existing users to bring in more users if there's something that makes sense on that end? Even how do I optimize my revenue model?"

(00:26:53):
Once all of those things are working well, then I'll obsess on the customer acquisition side. But customer acquisition is so hard that if you're not really efficient at converting-

Sean Ellis (00:27:00):
... customer acquisition is so hard that if you're not really efficient at converting and retaining and monetizing people, you're going to really struggle on the customer acquisition side.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:09):
Yeah, cool. And we'll talk about customer acquisition/growth.

Sean Ellis (00:27:13):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:14):
Another question I wanted to ask, and a couple listeners asked, is the 40%. I had Jag from Nubank on the podcast, I think you may have worked with them, and they use 50% as their threshold because apparently Brazilians are very nice.

Sean Ellis (00:27:27):
Yeah. Optimistic I think is what I said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):
Yeah. I guess the question is do you find instances where you should increase that percentage? And in B2B, is anything different? Do you change the percentage in B2B? Any advice there just when you adjust the threshold?

Sean Ellis (00:27:42):
Yeah, I hadn't really thought too much on that. Again, for me, generally I'm trying to just figure out is this a product that can grow? So if I got a 37%, am I going to be like, "Oh no, this would be impossible?" Or if I had a 70%, does that mean I'd say, "Oh yeah, I want to jump in and work with this company?" It's more nuanced than that. Obviously, if it's a 70%, but I have no idea how I grow the business, I'm going to be stuck there. But I do think he brought up a really good point that, culturally, some people are going to be more optimistic or pessimistic. Interestingly, when I came up with the question, I used to just use a normal satisfaction question.

(00:28:39):
When I was working at Xobni, I'm just an intensely curious person anyway, so I'm just trying to dig in and understand the customers, and so I've always done lots of surveying. But at Xobni, I was going to use my filter as a satisfaction question, so how satisfied are you with this? I'm very satisfied. I'm somewhat satisfied. And our main customers were actually senior management, and so I thought senior management's never satisfied. I'm going to get always this super lukewarm thing. How can I change this question to give me a more real answer from these guys? Well, if I flip it and say, "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" I'll probably get a more honest answer back from them. And of course, they're very disappointed if they can't get what they want.

(00:29:29):
And so initially it was just for the case of Xobni, but then I went to Dropbox right after Xobni and like, "Oh, I'll try the question again." And the insights I got back were really useful. And so each company I went to, I kept using the question. I'm like, this works way better than your typical satisfaction question. But initially, it was more about thinking just senior management to get a more honest answer out of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:54):
So that's the origin story right there?

Sean Ellis (00:29:56):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:57):
Wow. That senior managers are just very harsh and they don't need anything?

Sean Ellis (00:30:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):
And you have to flip it. That is so interesting. That question is such a good reminder of how hard it is to build anything people really would be disappointed not to have. That's why this works so well. People are like, "I don't need this. Who cares?" That's the core of this, is just that is hard.

Sean Ellis (00:30:19):
Especially when I first moved to Silicon Valley. The first 15 years of my career were not in Silicon Valley, and so I was in Eastern Europe and then New York and then Boston. But you move to Silicon Valley and you have people who get really excited about technology for technology's sake. And so just something being cool is like, "Isn't it cool that we can actually do this?" drives a lot of people. And so to me, I'm very practical. If it's not something that is really bringing value to people, then the likelihood that that product's successful long-term is going to be pretty low.

(00:30:59):
Even, interestingly, at Dropbox, through the six months I was there, I'd ask one question multiple times a month. I broke the early beta users into a bunch of different lists. And I'd ask, "Which best describes you? I like to be among the first to try cool new technology, or, I only try things that I think will be useful for me?" And over the six months, it flipped from 90% being people who try things that they want to try cool new technology to six months later, it was people who only are going to try something that they feel like is useful. But what's cool is just because what motivates you to try something is you're an early adopter and you want to try something cool, if you're going to keep using it, it's because it's giving you some utility. And so I can still use those early adopters to help me figure out where's the value inside the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
Awesome. So actually, two questions along those lines. How durable do you find this percentage being? Say you hit 40%, how often does that fade and go away versus stay there or go higher?

Sean Ellis (00:32:07):
Yeah, I haven't seen it really fade back down, but I've seen companies fail despite having it. And I think a lot of times then, it becomes an execution challenge. Once you have product-market fit, not everyone's going to be a good executor. But before that, I think getting to product-market fit, obviously there's a lot of methodology for doing it today that might make it a bit easier for people, but I still think it's fairly random and pretty dang hard. And so ultimately, the risk factor of creating something that people care about is really difficult. So if you can get to the point where you have 40% of the people who are using it saying they'd be very disappointed, and you have a reasonable sample size. Let's say you've got 10 people and four of them said they'd be very disappointed without it, you're still going to get something useful from those four. But I wouldn't say that's a sample size that you can really go to market on, so yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):
What's a good sample size you look for of just, "Okay, this is actually good data I want to rely on?"

Sean Ellis (00:33:11):
It's really funny. So much of the stuff I self-learned, but I basically at one point said I need at least 30 responses, and I just thought I randomly made up a number and then I had people telling me, "Yeah, 30 is the minimum that you want on stuff." Okay. And even when I first created this survey, I remember showing it to the co-founder of SlideShare and her PhD was in survey-related stuff like cognitive psychology, but she basically said it was really about surveying. And she's like, "This methodology is amazing. How did you come up with this?" And so having some of that validation around these things helped. But a lot of it was just, again, driven by my own curiosity and also just knowing that that failure is such a likely outcome that trying to reverse engineer that failure, and then the number one reason for failure would be that people don't actually care about the product. And so when I find that, that's a really good sign that we're now down to an execution challenge.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:15):
And there's this obvious element of you may have product-market fit with people, but that group might end up being very small and the business you build around it could actually be cool, but it's not going to be a massive business. Is there anything there you can share? It's hard to know the size opportunity even though some people really, really like it.

Sean Ellis (00:34:35):
Yeah, I talked about I go to a multiple choice after I initially use open-ended questions to crowdsource the different use cases. But then I try to force people in a bucket, and then I can run filters on each of those buckets and I'll be like, "Oh, people who use it this way are like 60% likely to be very disappointed without the product, but people who use it this way are 35% likely to be very disappointed, but way more people use it the 35% way." And so then, do you want that intensely loyal group or the much broader group that's maybe a bit less, but almost there?

(00:35:17):
I think that becomes a bit of a strategic conversation of do we want to have a better chance of surviving, going after a niche that we know we can serve well? Or have we raised so much money that we have to go after a really big market, and one that's not going to be long-term? But maybe then you're like, "Okay, once I have traction in that market, I can start to try to appeal to some other markets." But I think that's where some strategic decisions come in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):
Do you have a heuristic of which you often recommend or is it very dependent on the situation?

Sean Ellis (00:35:53):
I prefer a more passionate customer base and work from there, just because I think your biggest competition when you're really innovating is just being irrelevant. And so if you're deeply relevant to anyone, I think that gives you a much better chance of long-term success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):
Awesome. That's a really good insight. Okay, two more questions along this line and then I want to talk about growth strategy. One very tactical question. Is there a tool you recommend for doing this sort of survey? Do you recommend inline? In the product? An email? Something else?

Sean Ellis (00:36:26):
I've used a lot of different tools. I actually had a survey business that I sold to private equity years ago. It is called Qualaroo. That's an inflow survey tool. I think just using SurveyMonkey with emailed surveys works fine. And for me, it's a lot more of what's pleasant for the customer to fill out and then what's going to give me something where I can work really easily with the data? So at Bounce, for example, they had already intercom in place that had just introduced surveying, but it was a really crappy customer experience, at least at that time. That's been almost a year now or actually a little over a year. And so I'm really sensitive to is it a good survey experience for the consumer itself? But yeah, I don't think I'm stuck to any one platform there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):
Such an important topic. Just, again, to remind people why this is so important, one of the most common questions founders ask is, "Do I have product-market fit? Have I built something people want?" That's just an endless series of, "I don't know. How do I know? When do I know?" And this is telling you in a really interesting way. So your advice is this is a leading indicator. You don't actually know until people actually start using it and whether they retain and continue using it. Is there just advice on the shift you make from relying on the survey to actually looking at retention cohorts? Is it just once you have enough data, once you have a couple of cohorts, then start looking at that? Forget about the survey?

Sean Ellis (00:38:05):
Yeah, but retention cohorts don't give you any of the qualitative insights into the why, so that's why we continue to do the survey. So initially I would say if the survey comes back and it shows whatever your target number is... If you want to be Nubank, it'd be a 50%. Or two of the companies I launched, we launched in Hungary, and I would say it was the opposite end of the spectrum of Brazil, maybe more pessimistic than the average culture. And so maybe 30% is good enough there, but that ultimately, whatever your target is, that you have the signal that says, "Okay, we have enough value here. Let's start working on growing the business." But while you're working on growing the business, I would be paying attention to those retention cohorts. And if you're churning out all the customers who were saying that they'd be very disappointed without the product, then okay, let's retrench and rethink, do we really have product-market fit here and what do we need to do to get it if we don't?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):
Awesome. And speaking of Nubank, if anyone wants to see how a company has actually operationalized this in the way they operate, that there's an episode that we'll link to in the show notes where every new product at Nubank they build, before they launch it, they wait for 50% threshold. For people to say 50% of people would be disappointed if this product did not exist as they're developing it. And only then do they launch it publicly.

Sean Ellis (00:39:36):
Yeah, I think they even do it down to the feature level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
Wow.

Sean Ellis (00:39:40):
So if you think about it, how would you feel if you can no longer use this feature starts to give you, again, the signal, is that feature a must-have feature? And if it's not, maybe we shouldn't have it. And so yeah, I was super excited when I saw how they were using the survey and they were doing it before I engaged with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:00):
Oh, wow. That's awesome.

Sean Ellis (00:40:01):
But they were doing it, I think, from pretty early on in the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
The reason they can do this is they have a lot of users. They have millions of millions of users, so they can ask some small percentage of people this question. Because people hearing this might be like, "Oh my God, how many times am I going to be asked this question when I'm using this feature?" But they have a lot of users, so it's easier.

Sean Ellis (00:40:17):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:18):
Okay. Last question, I promise, along these lines. Say someone is listening and they're like, "Okay. Man, I'm getting 10%, I'm getting 15%. I don't know what to do to increase my product-market fit." You should have just a strategy of just dig into the people that are very disappointed and see what they have to say. But any other advice/what do you find often works in helping people move from, say, 10% to 40%?

Sean Ellis (00:40:43):
Yeah, so one of the things that's cool about almost open-sourcing the survey approach is, again, watching how Nubank has evolved their usage. But one of the other companies that I think used it in an interesting way is Superhuman. And I would say that they basically ended up probably putting a lot more momentum behind the question than it had even before. They posted something about how they did it on First Round Capital's blog. And what I have always said, and again, it's me coming at it from probably initially a marketing background, which is I'm taking the product as a fixed thing, and how do I actually figure out how to market and grow this product? And product changes are going to take a long time, and so what are the variables that I can control with a marketing background? So one of the things I've always said is just ignore the people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. They're telling you it's a nice to have. They're as good as gone, so just ignore those guys.

(00:41:54):
I'll put one piece in the middle there before I say what Superhuman did. The reason that I say ignore those guys is that if you start paying attention to what you somewhat disappointed users are telling you, and then you start tweaking onboarding and product based on their feedback, maybe you're going to dilute it for your must-have users. And ultimately, it becomes kind of good for everyone but not great for anyone. And so that was my fear of trying to read too much into the users who say they'd be somewhat disappointed. But the Superhuman guys actually found, I think, a good way around that where they said, "Okay, what is the benefit that my must-have users are focused on? And then of the users who say they'd be somewhat disappointed, so the nice-to-have users, of those users who are also focused on that benefit, what do they need in the product for it then to become a must-have for them?"

(00:42:48):
And so they're staying true to that core benefit, but they're trying to essentially take those on-the-fence users and moving them up. And so I think their way of approaching that addressed what my concern was, which is are we going to break it for the must-have users?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:05):
That's an awesome insight. By the way, did Rahul and the team there just do this on their own or were you involved in any way in this at Superhuman?

Sean Ellis (00:43:11):
No. That's the same thing. Like I said, I wasn't initially involved with Nubank. I wasn't involved with them. We wrote about it in our book in 2017, and so I think that I got it out there. But I actually teamed up with the Kissmetrics team in 2012, and essentially published this survey on survey.io where we just made it freely available for people and a really easy template to prepare and send out, and the how-to guide on it. It was all just free. Kissmetrics is using it as maybe lead gen. And for me, I just wanted a way to put something out for the community. And so it's been out there for a long time, so it's not surprising that different companies have found different unique ways to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
That's awesome. I think that post is one of the most popular in First Round. It really had an impact on a lot of people.

Sean Ellis (00:44:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:06):
So just to repeat, the approach you recommend for when you're digging into... I wrote this down. When you were talking for how to dig into what benefit people are finding, your advice is it's basically a follow-up survey to the extremely disappointed people asking them what is the primary benefit you get? It's an open text initially. Then once you get a collection, you do it sounds like another survey as multiple choice. Here's five benefits-

Sean Ellis (00:44:31):
To a different group of people, to be clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:33):
Different group. Yeah. Got it. Awesome. And then it's like, which of these four or five benefits is what you're getting out of this product? And then the question is, why is this benefit important to you?

Sean Ellis (00:44:45):
Eventually the survey.io got closed down, but essentially the template that I typically used was then moved to PMFsurvey.com. And so you'll see some other questions that I have on there as well, like what would you use instead if this product were no longer available? And that's one of the interesting things is you start to see people who say they'd be somewhat disappointed, usually, they're focused on a commodity use case and they know an easy alternative to switch to. So to be a must-have, it needs to be both valuable and unique.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
Okay. Anything else on this topic of the Sean Ellis task product-market fit test before we move on to growth strategy advice?

Sean Ellis (00:45:26):
No, I think that's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):
I think we did almost an hour on that one topic, which I love because I feel like this is such a powerful tool that I think people sort of know and have used, but I think there's a lot of opportunity to use it more effectively. And all the stuff you pointed out about it's not just you have this threshold goal, let's move, let's grow. It's like, this is how you figure out how to make it better and better and grow faster and faster. And it's actually a good segue to talking about growth.

(00:45:50):
Even though you coined the term growth hacking, you spend most of your time on the opposite, essentially, which is helping companies figure out sustainable growth strategies, not just a bunch of hacks to grow for a little bit and then disappear. And from what I've seen, it's all rooted in this idea of product-market fit and what helps you find product-market fit, and I imagine many of the stuff we've talked about.

Sean Ellis (00:46:10):
Yeah. Just one quick interjection there is that when I coined growth hacking, I did not think of it as a bunch of one-off hacks. What I thought of it was what's more about what is the way to ultimately drive sustainable growth? But it's, over time, maybe more interpreted the way you described it, but just to jump in and say that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:30):
That's a really good clarification, so how did you actually initially frame it when you first-

Sean Ellis (00:46:34):
Yeah, I just said it's about looking at every single thing that you're doing and scrutinizing its impact on growth in the business. And particularly, I think most marketers, when I first moved to Silicon Valley, most CEOs who were asking me to help their companies, they were saying, "We need help with awareness-building," and I'm getting introductions from top VCs. And so, so much of, I think, the way people were approaching growth was marketing textbook how to approach it. And startups just don't have the luxury to do all of those things, and so you got to really focus on how do I acquire customers to an experience that's going to make them keep using this product? And so maybe I picked the wrong term in calling it growth hacking, but I think it at least opened the conversation to getting more people thinking about maybe we should be thinking about growth in a different way than as it's traditionally taught in marketing courses in school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:33):
Is there another term you think you should have used? Do you always think back, I should have called it this? Is there anything that you've had in your mind?

Sean Ellis (00:47:41):
I don't. I think sometimes having something that's a little divisive is almost better because it's too easy to just go completely unnoticed. But I was trying to put a name on not just how I was approaching growth, but seeing Facebook obviously had a very different approach to growth than most companies. LinkedIn, Twitter, there was a handful of companies that were approaching it in the same way I had previously been approaching it, and I just thought this thing needs a name. And so I sat down with a couple of friends, came up with a name and it stuck. But yeah, obviously from day one it was pretty divisive with different groups.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):
That's a fun story. Thanks for sharing that.

(00:48:25):
Okay, so talking about growth and helping companies figure out how to grow. Say you go to a company, they're getting 42% on the Sean Ellis test, and they're like, "Okay, cool, let's start thinking about growth." What's your first piece of advice to them to start when they're thinking about growth? And then just broadly, how do you approach helping them figure out how to grow?

Sean Ellis (00:48:45):
Ultimately, it's about trying to get as many of the right people to that same state that we just talked about with the must-have users, so trying to get as many people to experience the product in a way where they'd be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product. And so that's not just acquisition, which is how most companies think about... Initially, it was awareness then maybe the more developed way was, oh, let's at least focus on profitable acquisition. But in my experience, the hardest part really sits inside the product team, so how do you shape that first user experience so they actually use it in the right way and it's not so difficult that they give up? And that ultimately, we understand what makes it a must-have product. And then what we're trying to do is build a... Yeah, it sounds kind of theoretical here, but I can go into the details on how, but build a flywheel around that must-have value.

(00:49:45):
So step one would be understand it. Step two for me is then figure out a metric that essentially captures units of that value being delivered. And so when I think about a north star metric, that's what I'm thinking about is something that reflects how many people are coming in and experiencing that product-market fit experience, whatever that is. And it's not just me telling them, "Here's what your north star metric should be." It's that ultimately the team needs to decide that together. And then really just diagramming, what are all of the different ways that we can grow that north star metric? So that's where you start to actually build, I call it a value delivery engine, but it's what does our onboarding look like? What's that aha moment? That activation? What does the engagement loop look like? Is there any referral? Try to capture it as it is today.

(00:50:47):
And then, from there, thinking about where are the biggest opportunities for improvement, so those high-leverage opportunities, and then ultimately starting to run experiments against those opportunities. Generally, I think I touched on it a little bit earlier, but generally the sequence that I like to do is start with activation because that one's just so critical and it's easy to get lost in between, especially for an early product. The product team's so focused on the roadmap. We're two features away from not even needing marketing anymore. This thing's going to take off. And then a marketing team so focused on bringing new people in, but how do you get those new people to a great first experience falls through the cracks a lot of times. So a lot of focus on activation and then engagement and referral and getting the revenue model right. And then once each of those pieces are working well, then starting to really obsess on the channel side.

(00:51:49):
One thing that I'll say. When I go in and directly am involved with a company on the acquisition side, I am thinking about my hypotheses on the acquisition pretty early on, because if I go into it and I have no idea how we'll acquire those customers, I'm not real confident I'll figure it out when I'm there. So I want to have two or three things that seem pretty viable as ways to profitably acquire customers, and knowing that once I get deep into it, I'll probably come up with one or two more and I've got five, one of them's likely to work. But I don't want to just be under the pressure of having to come up with that once I come in, if I don't at least see an angle from that before I get involved with the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:36):
What I'm hearing is when you come into a company and they're asking, "Sean, how do we figure out how to grow this thing?" you actually focus first on activation onboarding, and we're going to talk about all these things. Then, after that, basically these are priority order for you. Then it's flywheel engagement referral stuff to see if there's a way to drive that. Then revenue. How do we make money with this and how do we make sure we're doing this profitably? And only then do you start to go big on acquisition top-of-funnel growth.

Sean Ellis (00:53:05):
Yeah. I may need to do some acquisition stuff before just to bring enough flow-through, but I'm not obsessing on how scalable is this. It's just like, yeah, let's get enough people coming through that we can start to take the slack out. Part of it comes down to that the acquisition side is so competitive now that if you're not really efficient at converting and retaining and monetizing customers, you can't find scalable, profitable customer acquisition channels.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
This is fascinating because I think a lot of people probably do the opposite. Start driving a bunch of growth to a product, then we'll fix onboarding, then we'll figure out how we're making money, and referrals comes along there. So I think this is really important for people to hear. So again, the reason you invest first and focus a lot on onboarding/getting people activated is because that is very correlated to retention and this must-have customer, this, "I'll be very disappointed," customer.

Sean Ellis (00:53:58):
Yeah. And they're at highest risk of losing them at that point. They-

Sean Ellis (00:54:00):
They're at highest risk of losing them at that point. They're probably a little skeptical about a promise that you put out there, but they're intrigued enough to want to use it. But until you get them to that must-have experience, until you kind of get them to that aha moment, they're at their high risk of being lost. And so a lot of people focus on, "Well, I better get their email address or their phone number." But then you're essentially having to reacquire them at that point. So to me, if you can collapse that time to value, I can give you a couple of incredible examples of when we [inaudible 00:54:38]

(00:54:37):
So at LogMeIn, when we initially tried to grow the business, I was stuck at being able to spend... I couldn't spend more than $10,000 per month profitably trying to grow the business. And then I dug into the data and I saw that 95% of the people signing up for LogMeIn. So LogMeIn, at the time free remote access for your computer. And so you install software and you can control it from any other computer. So 95% of the people signing up never once did a remote control session. And so not surprisingly, then I had to get my monetization off the 5% who did that was really limiting my ability to find channels that worked.

(00:55:24):
Credit our CEO with this, that I shared the data with him and he basically told the product team, "We are putting a complete freeze on the product development roadmap." So every single person from product, engineering, design and then also said to me, "Stop trying to find new channels." The three of us on the marketing side are all going to focus on improving the signup to usage rate. And so in three months, we improve the signup to usage rate by a thousand percent. So we went from only 5% of people using the product to 50%. I went back, tried the exact same channels that previously only scaled to $10,000 a month.

(00:56:05):
Now they scaled to a million dollars a month with a three-month payback on marketing dollars invested. 80% of new users were coming in through word of mouth. So there was this major inflection point by just focusing on activation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):
This episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you. The folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product or HRIS data to auto-provision and de-provision access for their customer's employees.

(00:57:04):
And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny. What do you find often works in helping increase activation? I know there's a million things that people do, but I guess what are three or four things that you think people should definitely try to help improve activation and their onboarding conversion?

Sean Ellis (00:57:40):
One of my favorite quotes is a quote from a guy Kettering, who was a hundred years ago at GM running innovation. And he says, "A problem well stated is a problem half solved." And so I think a lot of it comes down to not the things you try, but how you deeply understand the problem that's preventing someone from using your product effectively. And so I'll just give you one example. We had one channel after we made a lot of these changes and had already driven a ton of improvement in the LogMeIn onboarding. We found a demand generation channel that was really cheap and the economics looked great, but at just the download step we had a 90% drop off rate.

(00:58:26):
And so we A/B tested a bunch of different things there to try to improve that conversion rate, and then finally 10 plus tests, not able to improve it. Finally, someone said, "When these people are registering. Why don't we just ask them why they signed up and didn't download the software?" And so we didn't want to do it in too kind of a creepy way. So we made it look like a note coming from customer service. This channel was sending 200,000 people a day, so 20,000 people were converting to registering. So we had essentially 20,000 people we could email and then 18,000 of them who didn't download. And so we just asked, "Hey, notice you haven't had a chance to use the product yet.

(00:59:11):
It looked like it was coming from customer support. What happened?" And the answer we got back and not a formal survey was, "Oh, this seemed too good to be true. I didn't believe this was free." I mentioned to you we were one of the first freemium SaaS products out there. And so people were skeptical, especially in a demand gen channel where they hadn't seen a radio or a TV advertisement from our competitor who was a premium only product. These were people who were discovering the category for the first time they were getting there. Once we articulated what the problem was, our next test gave us a 300% improvement in the download rate, which was...

(00:59:54):
We gave them a choice, download a trial of the paid version or download the free version, put a big graphical check mark next to the free version. But when they saw we had a business model and a trial of a paid version, the free version was credible. And so that essentially made that channel work for us. So I think again, it's that combination of qualitative research, looking at how others did it. We had this theory, our previous company had been a game company that didn't require a download. So initially we had this theory that maybe just downloadable software can't be in the millions of new customers a month and so we're being unrealistic here.

(01:00:31):
But then we were like, "Are there any counter examples to that"? And no, the instant messengers are downloadable and they have hundreds of millions of customers, so let's study their download and install process and see if we have any ideas that we could borrow from that. So again, some inspiration, tried some of those things, it was a combination of just trying a bunch of different stuff that ultimately led to, I wouldn't say there was one big gain, it was a bunch of small gains.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):
Awesome. So a few things for people to try if they're like, "Hey, how do I improve my activation rate? How do I improve my conversion rate?" Just drill further into what is stopping people from progressing. Ask them, "Why did you bounce here? What did you think this was going to be? Why didn't you end up using this?" Look for inspiration from other products, I think people probably already know that. You talked about earlier this idea of the positioning, having a big impact of just figuring out.

(01:01:26):
They want an antivirus software. Let's make that very clear. "Hey we've got the best antivirus software, that's what we're here for." So there's probably just messaging that you find works a lot of times, right?

Sean Ellis (01:01:36):
I mean your two big levers on driving a conversion are increase desire, reduce friction. And so you definitely want to increase the right desire. Sometimes it can also just be reminding people along the way of what benefits you're going to get. In the case of LogmeIn, it was probably the most complicated funnel I've ever seen because you couldn't even get to the aha moment while you're sitting in front of the computer. You had to actually go to a different computer and to use the service to remote control the computer you're in front of.

(01:02:12):
So it's not surprising that there was so many steps where we could lose people, but we just weren't that intentional about designing each of those steps initially. And it wasn't until we thought through why would we lose someone at this step and studying the data, which steps were we losing the most people at? Then deeply trying to contextualize why are we losing them there, coming up with a set of tests that we want to run and then having a good way of deciding which one to test first and ultimately focusing the tests on the areas where we're losing the most people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:45):
The other element of this is coming up with an activation metric and aligning on here's what we consider so activated. I know this is very dependent on the product, but any advice or heuristic for how to help people decide this is our activated user.

Sean Ellis (01:02:58):
I tend to start qualitatively. So just like when do I think they've had a good enough experience with the product to really know it? And so in the case of LogMeIn, it was pretty easy. If they didn't do a remote control session, they didn't use the product. There was no value along the way there. And then at least try to see if there's a correlation to long-term retention of doing that. Causation is you need to do some experimentation to prove causation. At the very least, I want to see that correlation, but if I start with two or three ideas of what it might be and then go and study the data, that can help you focus.

(01:03:41):
But again, I don't think there's necessarily one exact right answer of what is that aha moment. There might be two or three different things. I think it's that intentionality about picking something that's experience-based and saying, "What is a likely experience that someone's going to get a good enough taste of this product?" And then I do see some companies that are like, "Well, the activation moment should be, they've used it a hundred times." That's going to correlate to long-term retention, but it's just not very actionable. It's so far down the user experience.

(01:04:16):
So ideally if there's a way that I could get them there in the first session, in the first day, that's great. And so it's sort of something that's value that can be experienced super early. To give you an example from the first company I worked on was a game company, where I actually flipped it and basically instead of making a traditional funnel where they could play our games after they signed up, I made our games the advertisements. So basically we syndicated our games to 40,000 websites.

(01:04:48):
They started gameplay experience on the other website, then they would get a message that they now have a qualifying score and if they register, they'll be in the drawing for the weekly cash prize and then we could pull them into multiplayer games on the site. And so it's kind of the strategy that YouTube used to grow, but it was two years before YouTube introduced the approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):
It feels like you basically created Zynga, is what I'm hearing there. So let's move further down the funnel. So we've talked about activation, onboarding. The next phase that you focus on is basically some people call this growth loops, growth engines, flywheels. Basically it's the thing that helps your business grow and something I am curious if this resonates.

(01:05:35):
I found there's basically four ways to grow and usually one of these engines is responsible for almost all of your growth. So what I've seen is basically you're going to go through sales, you're going to grow through SEO, you're going to go through virality, word of mouth or paid growth. Does that resonate? Does that feel right?

Sean Ellis (01:05:52):
And I wouldn't say it's necessarily one or the other. I think Bounce is a really interesting example where SEO is super important for Bounce. So people who are essentially saying, "Luggage storage, Paris. Luggage storage..." Most people when they're trying to find a place to store their luggage, they're starting with Google, but at the same time, a huge percentage of the people who use Bounce are dragging their bag down a street over cobblestones in Paris. And then they pass a sign that says, "Store your bag here for $5 a day." And it's like, "Oh, no-brainer." And so 10,000 partners around the world means that there's a lot of people in the right situation on the demand gen side.

(01:06:44):
One would be, I actually think of kind of... I'm not sure how it would map to this, but demand generation versus demand harvesting. And so one of those examples would be a... Demand generation example, when you see the signs when you're passing, it's high context, right place. And then obviously the demand harvesting would be anyone who's Googling. And so they do paid search and organic search there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):
Interesting. I don't see that sign approach work often, but I definitely have seen it work. Like Yelp I think grew in a lot of ways of just little Yelp stickers in all the restaurant. DoorDash I think probably grows through that.

Sean Ellis (01:07:20):
I think every business could be a little bit different, but for Bounce it makes sense that that would be a really good opportunity for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
How do you help a business figure out which area to bet on? Whether they should go paid, whether they should go SEO, whether they should hire sales. Sales is probably an easier one. B2B, you're probably going to have to be a sales team, I guess just to help them pick, "Here's where you have a big opportunity."

Sean Ellis (01:07:46):
Again, it kind of comes down as I'm going into it, I'm thinking what are the realistic customer acquisition angles for this business? And I want to have ideally two or three that I'm coming into it with, but it's going to... Obviously Dropbox is a classic one of like, "Oh man, this product..." User get user is going to be just a classic. There's file share built into it, folder collaboration. There's so many pieces of it that cross from one user to the next. But interestingly, it was fairly similar to LogMeIn in some senses, it's two businesses are solving similar problems in different ways. Where LogMeIn, we grew almost entirely off of paid search. And part of it again is that for us, we had a competitor that was spending tens of millions of dollars a month creating the category with a premium only product through radio and TV advertising. GoToMyPC, they're creating all this latent demand. And so it just made sense for us to disrupt them with a freemium service and to insert ourselves in the flow of someone... What was that thing that I heard about on the TV commercial? And now they go and they Google it and same thing, but free. So we weren't really pushing for differentiation, but just really trying to harvest that.

(01:09:15):
So I couldn't do that at Dropbox. No one was looking for when I went there. And so we tried a little bit with search to see can we make it work on cloud storage or backup or kind of going to some of these traditional categories. Cloud storage wasn't even a traditional category at that point, but backup was, and it was fairly expensive and there was just not that much demand there that way. And so it just made more sense to focus on the user get user loops at Dropbox.

(01:09:50):
I think basically for each business it's just thinking about what's unique for that business that is going to open up channel opportunities and everyone's going to be a little bit, I think jaded from whatever the last thing that worked really well. They're going to think they can apply it in the next business. But after enough times myself, I tend to get the most inspiration by just talking to customers and finding out how did they find it, how do they typically find something like that? And that starts to give me some ideas as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:28):
I think that last point is really powerful and I'm just writing it down. You said, essentially one of your tactics is talking to users, asking them how did you find this product and how do you normally find products like this? Is that the second question? I think it's similar to your [inaudible 01:21:02] test. It's such a simple question, but it's so powerful because how else will people find your product? They go to a place to find stuff like this, and I searched Google for folder sharing. There's so much there that you just skip over.

Sean Ellis (01:11:03):
I think the reason that you don't actually hear people taking the obvious route there a lot of times is because, and I used to be in the same thing, that people tend to be either over indexed on qualitative or over indexed on quantitative. So it's like analytics, I'm going to get all my answers from testing and analytics or I'm going to get all my answers from traditional customer research. And I was very much in that initial camp for the first five years of my career. I'm just going to measure everything and test the heck out of things and find stuff that works. But I had a VC who was our lead VC at LogMeIn who just said, "When was the last time you talked to a customer?"

(01:11:45):
Just pushed me to survey and talk to customers all the time. And at first I gave the smart-ass answer, "I don't care what they say, I care what they do." And he's like, "No, you got to talk to him." Then just to appease him, I would try to have a conversation every day because he was in our office a lot and so I could say, "Hey, yeah, I talked to a customer today," when he would ask me. But I started finding that my experiments were so much better the more I talked to customers, and eventually I became very much... The blend of qualitative and quantitative research leads to much better tests.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:21):
That is another amazing story and insight. It's so interesting that people sometimes think of you as growth hacker guy experiments data, when most of the advice we've been sharing so far is very qualitative driven, very survey driven, targeting customers driven.

Sean Ellis (01:12:36):
And it is just really hard to run good experiments when you can't deeply contextualize what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):
I love this. By the way, I don't know if I knew this. So you helped develop the Dropbox referral program?

Sean Ellis (01:12:47):
I was there at the time. Basically, even when I first started talking with Drew. Before I came in, I was like, "I think the way we're going to grow this business is by leveraging the really passionate customer base and that's what we need to double down on." And we had tried a similar kind of referral program at Zabni and a friend who actually started Ring, Jamie Simonoff, previously had a company called PhoneTag way before Ring, and he had actually done a lot of the testing on double-sided referral programs and having incentive on both sides, and he found that that worked the best.

(01:13:33):
And so between what we had tested at Zabni and those conversations with him, I hadn't actually seen PayPal yet at that point, what they were doing. But that was kind of like... It seems like a referral program where we have incentives on both sides is the best way to go. Interestingly, six months before I was at Dropbox, I was at LogMeIn, and I really thought about having incentivized referrals at LogMeIn, but 80% of our new users were coming in through word of mouth. And I had a hundred million devices connected in on our system, and I was just so afraid of breaking this growth engine by adding an incentive that I didn't want to risk it.

(01:14:18):
But at Dropbox it was so early. I would still say no experiment is one person. It happened to be when I was there, I had some insights that I brought in, but ultimately... The guy who built it was actually an intern named Albert Knee and he ended up dropping out, I think, out of MIT to stay with Dropbox for a few years after that. But he was kind of my right-hand guy to collaborating on growth day to day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:47):
Wow. I would say Dropbox is the referral program, and the PayPal referral program, as you mentioned, are the two most legendary, studied, copied referral programs out there.

Sean Ellis (01:14:56):
Unfortunately, I think that what they don't realize is that before the referral program, Dropbox had amazing referral rate. Companies that are trying to copy it are like, "Why isn't anyone talking about a product? Let's add a referral program with incentives." To me, I think it's a great accelerant when it's already working, but it can't fix it if people don't want to talk about your product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
That's an awesome point and something I was just going to ask about and just coming back to this topic of growing engagement, growing referrals as a growth mechanism, what do you look for to tell you that there's an opportunity there? And I'll just answer it, partly I've seen exactly what you just said, which is you need to already have strong word of mouth growth because referrals kind sits on that and gives you a little more incentive to share. So maybe do you agree with that, not agree to that? Any other advice on helping figure out is there some kind of loop here that we can build?

Sean Ellis (01:15:53):
Well, one thing I will say is freemium when we first started with it, as I said, we were one of the first with it, so it took me a while to figure out exactly how freemium worked, but to me, freemium towards having a free and a premium version of your product to really work in any business, it needs to be that your free product is so good that people naturally have word of mouth around that product. And then to be economically viable, you have to have a premium product that's better enough and differentiated enough that people are going to upgrade to the premium product.

(01:16:31):
But I think a lot of times people are so worried about the second part that they make the free version not very good and then they're surprised when word of mouth isn't very strong there. So I think you have to essentially have two distinct products that are great on their own. So that would be the one piece, but then obviously companies that have any kind of collaborative layer to them are going to be more likely to work well with referral. And then I think on the engagement side, a lot of it comes down to just the nature of the product.

(01:17:10):
Like Airbnb, you're not going to use it every day unless you're like a vagrant or something and then you wouldn't have money to pay for it. So there's kind a natural usage cycle to products and you want to be able to maximize against that cycle. That's where I was saying, coming back to the hooked model, I think is a really good way to help to have a framework to think about how do I improve engagement. One good counter example to that though of the natural frequency of using a product is Facebook when they change their North Star Metric from monthly active users to daily active users. I think, again, just having what gets measured gets managed.

(01:18:03):
Once Facebook was on a daily active user goal, the team suddenly had a lot more incentive to think about, "How do I bring people back every day and use this product?" Where when it was monthly active users, they kind of only got credit for that person for using once in that month. And even if they used 10 times, they didn't get 10 times the credit. It was just like a, "Oh, that's cool too." But they weren't sort of measured on that. And so I think it was sort of a random decision for Mark Zuckerberg to move from a monthly active to a daily active because they hit 1 billion monthly active users and they're like, "Okay, let's go for 1 billion daily active users."

(01:18:42):
But it had a really big impact on making that product way more addictive to the point where obviously they ended up in Congress or get a lot of pushback. I'm not sure they went to Congress for that, but they got a lot of pushback for having a product that's maybe too addictive. And the same thing carrying into Instagram and some of the other Meta products or basically anything that is highly engaging. So I do think the right incentives can actually help a team to focus on it, but there's going to be sort of a natural usage cycle to any product as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:22):
I'm glad you mentioned North Star Metrics. I actually have a post I will link to in the show notes where I collected the North Star Metrics of 30 different companies to give you some inspiration. I know this is a deep topic of its own, but just when someone is trying to pick their own North Star Metrics, which I 1000% agree, informs so much about how your company operates. It basically focuses everyone's incentives to let's drive this thing. And that changes so much of what you're building. Any just bullet point piece of advice for helping you pick your North Star Metrics?

Sean Ellis (01:19:50):
I start with the value that's uncovered through the [inaudible 01:21:02] test. So with a company, I'll say, "Okay, this is what the must have value is according to our most passionate customers, and we want to think about a metric that reflects us delivering that value." And then I'll give them kind of a framework of ways to think about a North Star Metric. But I think it's really important for it to be a time capped group conversation. And if you give a team 30 days, they'll take 30 days. If you give them six months, they'll take six months.

(01:20:25):
But I think generally a team can come up with a pretty good North Star Metric after 30 minutes if they have the right raw ingredients and a checklist of what's important in a North Star Metric. Something that's not a ratio, it's something that can be up onto the right over time. So you can keep managing it and feeling good. It should correlate to revenue growth, but revenue shouldn't be the North Star Metric, but as you grow value across your customer base, you should be able to grow revenue at the same rate. And so there's-

Sean Ellis (01:21:00):
Revenue at the same rate. And so there's some other things, but I think that would be the most important, is that it's something that could be up and to the right over time and reflects value that you're delivering to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):
Awesome. And I was going to ask about revenue in your opinion there. And so your advice is don't make revenue or North star metric?

Sean Ellis (01:21:17):
No. Even Amazon, and again, this is just what I know of Amazon's as being but monthly purchases, but someone else might say Amazon, no Amazon's is GMV or something. But I think monthly purchases is great because it maps to value that people are getting from Amazon. And so even if I spend say $1000 on a TV set with Amazon versus $3 on a or $10 on an electric toothbrush, Amazon from the consumer's perspective delivered the same value. I needed something, Amazon helped me find that thing. And so units of value from the customer perspective I think is more important than overall revenue. But clearly with Amazon focusing on driving more monthly purchases, at least on their store side of the business, that has helped them become one of most valuable companies in the world. So I think focusing on value is, revenue should be a product of doing things. Right. It shouldn't kind of guide your day-to-day actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:29):
To make this even more concrete for people, are there some North star metric examples you could share that you've seen that are good? Like say for Eventbrite or Dropbox or any companies you've worked with? And I'll share one real quick as you're thinking about it. At Airbnb, our North star metric was nights booked. And so it's similar to Amazon. It's not like the money Airbnb made from bookings, but it's like nights booked and it was really, and basically every experiment ran is like, is this increasing night booked or is this decreasing night's book?

Sean Ellis (01:22:57):
And so that's a really good marketplace one. Uber obviously weekly rides. I'm always surprised with the Airbnb, that there's not a kind of time piece on it, like the weekly rides that you have with Uber, but maybe it's because it's such an infrequent use case on travel that it doesn't make sense to focus on. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:19):
Yeah. Why is the timeframe important to you? Why do you encourage that?

Sean Ellis (01:23:24):
Just daily active users, you saw the difference between monthly active users and daily active users could change behavior a lot at Facebook. It gives you a quantifiable way, if you're just kind of taking an aggregate number over time, it always looks like it's going up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:41):
So it's an engagement element of how often are they engaging.

Sean Ellis (01:23:44):
Yeah. But,-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
Any others? Any others real quick?

Sean Ellis (01:23:47):
Yeah, I mean, I didn't really think about North star metrics when I was at Dropbox and Eventbrite, like the term itself, but I was thinking about what is a valuable experience with Dropbox and how do I get people to have that more time? But I don't even know what they go with today, but maybe files in Dropbox, files access might be better than just files hosted. And then probably for Eventbrite, again, I would say weekly tickets or something like you could say weekly events, but then you have events that don't sell any tickets where weekly tickets would be more likely to reflect, events are going to be happy if they're selling tickets and yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):
Okay. Sean, we've gone through so much stuff. I'm trying to limit how many more questions we get through just so that we don't,-

Sean Ellis (01:24:37):
We're going long.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:38):
We're going long, which is amazing. I think there's so much value here that we're collecting for folks. So let just ask maybe a couple more quick questions. One is actually from Andrew Chen who is currently partnered at a partner at A16z. He wrote about growth for the longest time. I think he helped popularize growth hacking for better or worse with his article and it being the future of VP of what is it? Growth Hacking is the new VP of marketing, right, Is the title. So he actually had a question for you that he shared with me. His question is, growth strategies have changed a lot over the past decade. What is the biggest difference now versus when you first started working on growth?

Sean Ellis (01:25:14):
When I first started just being data-driven on customer acquisition was enough to win and being test and data-driven on customer acquisition. All the other companies were like CPM focused and so we could do really well just with lots of testing and some creativity in how it all worked. But that over time as, now I would say most online marketers are very data and test drive. They know they need to do lots of testing. And so to be competitive today, you actually have to be able to be super efficient at all parts of the business.

(01:25:57):
So again, like how you convert, retain, monetize, and that's when it gets hard. Getting a marketing team to be data and test-driven is pretty easy. Once you start getting into activation and referral and engagement and retention, now you're talking about the overlap between marketing, product if it's B2B, bringing sales in there, customer success, and those teams are not used to working together. And so it's really hard to drive the collaboration that's needed to have an effective testing program across the entire growth engine. And that's pretty much any business that's been successful with it, implemented it super early in the business, and so very few later stage companies have been able to make much progress in replicating that type of approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:55):
It's just gotten harder basically. Things are just getting harder.

Sean Ellis (01:26:58):
It's gotten harder, but I think it's possible. So it's what I obsess about all the time, is how do you get cross-functional teams working together on growth now? And it's still a huge advantage when you can pull it off.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:13):
Okay. Totally unrelated question, going in completely different direction as we close out our chat. So you came up with ICE, the very popular way of prioritizing work, which is crazy. I did not know that until I started prepping for this conversation. What's your thoughts on RICE, the intercom version of ICE, where R stands for reach, I believe.

Sean Ellis (01:27:35):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:35):
Thoughts?

Sean Ellis (01:27:36):
So I think it's an unnecessary addition, but maybe I'm just being protective of my original idea, that the I in ICE is impact and it's essentially saying best case scenario, how much impact could we get from this? And reach is a super important part of impact. And so I think it's already factored in the I in ICE. And so I think if there's anything that I would be accused of, it would be being over simplifying things and I'm not saying them, but there's a lot of people who approach things with, there's got to be a more complex way to approach this and that's just not me. And so yeah, more testing is better.

(01:28:21):
No, it doesn't just work like that. I mean, better tests are better than bad tests, but just if you have to hold yourself accountable to anything, more testing would be better. And so I think one just quick note on ICE is that in order to be able to effectively run a high velocity testing program, you need to be able to source ideas from across the company. And that's why I came up with ICE, that if you're having people submit ideas and you can't tell them why their idea was not chosen, they're just going to get upset and you're going to waste a lot of time. But if you have a systematic way of being able to compare ideas, it's more likely that people will be able to get it and they'll be able to come up with better ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:06):
I love the way you think, Sean. I have a post on prioritization where I basically just make the same argument that there's all these complicated ways to prioritize. In the end, it's just impact, confidence, and effort and it really works and rarely is more work. On the other hand, I do also have a guest post called DRICE by these two guys called Detailed RICE, which actually I think is a really good point where sometimes it's worth spending like 30 minutes per idea to just really estimate how long will it take to avoid doing things that are just going to not work and very unlikely. So we're basically doing this reach piece and spending the time too. Right. And I think there's a lot of good value there.

Sean Ellis (01:29:45):
Yeah. And what I thinks going to be really interesting is that over time, I think AI is going to actually change our ability to model out potential outcomes on experiments and start to, whether it's a more informed way of doing ICE or replaces ICE, that ultimately probability of outcomes is something that AI will be pretty good at.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):
Well, amazing segue to the final question. The actually final question is I wanted to ask you about any ways you've been using AI or ways you think AI will impact the work you're doing or other folks are doing? And maybe you just answered it, but you tell me.

Sean Ellis (01:30:26):
No, I'll touch on a couple. One is that probably the funnest way that I'm using it today. Obviously I've done it for coming up with experiment ideas, but the funnest way I personally use it is I get a lot of people asking me for advice, and I don't have very much time to answer with thoughtful answers to people. And so almost every question that I get, I go to ChatGPT say, how would Sean Ellis answer this? And it gives me an initial draft to make a couple of tweaks and definitely allows me to answer a lot more. So it helps to have a book that's indexed in there and lots of writing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:07):
That is so funny, and that the question, that's as simple as the prompt is how would Sean Ellis answer,-

Sean Ellis (01:31:11):
Yeah, because then a lot of times it'll say, Sean Ellis, author of Hacking Growth dah, dah, dah, believes that, and then it'll obviously pull that part out in the answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:21):
Oh my God. So you're one step away from a Chrome extension or something that just automatically plugs that into your,-

Sean Ellis (01:31:26):
Yeah, exactly. And I can even start to have my personal assistant maybe start to answer some of those questions as me, but I'm a little bit afraid to send something without reviewing it first because,-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:37):
Absolutely.

Sean Ellis (01:31:38):
Sometimes there's stuff that's pretty different from how I would answer it, but longer term, I actually think, as I said, I think the cross-functional challenge to growth is a thing that holds a lot of companies back from being able to implement this a bit later. Mostly product teams don't want to get direction from marketing teams. Marketing teams don't want to get direction from product teams, and maybe a growth layer can help to do these things, but I find that if AI is essentially saying, you're underperforming in this area of your business, you should drive some experiments in this area. It's a lot harder to kind of let ego get in the way when it's kind of dispassionate recommendations from a system.

(01:32:22):
And so I actually think, I think the ability to come up with great experiments is going to keep growing with AI and identifying opportunities. And then obviously the analytical AI side of things is going to be really exciting in terms of being, I do find with most companies, once we get a real high velocity of experiments going, the bottleneck ends up happening more on the analysis side. And I think AI will help a lot with that as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:50):
Super cool. These are awesome examples. Okay, Sean, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round, which we'll go through real fast? Because we've gone very long and I want to let you go.

Sean Ellis (01:33:01):
Yeah. As I've gone through and done a lot of workshops and programs with companies, I keep coming back to this advice that I heard from guy Oleg Yakubenkov, which is it often comes down to asking the right question at the right time in how you figure things out. And he's a former data scientist from Meta and so where he basically boils data science down to learning how to ask the right questions. And so I actually have a course with him called Gopractice.io, where that's really the big benefit of the course, is to learn how to ask the right questions and yeah, you learn how to query them and amplitude, but more importantly, being able to ask the right question. I think it's kind of cool to hear that from a data scientist from Meta, the importance of that.

(01:33:49):
But every time I'm going through exercises in my workshops, it almost always comes down to people who aren't able to come up with the right or a good answer in a business. It's because they're not asking the obvious question. And as soon as they have, like why aren't users downloading the software? Let's just ask them that question. That would be one example from my workshop. Who considers the product a must have? That part of getting, to figuring out the must have kind of benefit that then allows you to hone in on product market fit. And so yeah, right questions, right time I think is a really important way to think about growth and even getting to product market fit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:40):
I love this advice because I think it gives us a glimpse into how your brain has developed these really seemingly simple ideas that end up being really powerful. And it feels like the advice is just think a lot about the question you need to ask because that'll get you just something that a lot of people just kind of under think or don't. There's things, maybe it's too simple.

Sean Ellis (01:35:02):
Yeah, or they just jump right into the solution side of things where they're not really trying to understand what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:08):
Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Okay, well with that, Sean, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Sean Ellis (01:35:14):
I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
All right. Our first question is, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Sean Ellis (01:35:20):
Increasingly, I'm recommending a book called Presenting to Win that's been around forever, but it really helped me with my presenting. And so of course when I'm out traveling, I'm often sharing the stage with other speakers and yeah, I like to recommend that one to them. I've already talked about Muriel's Hooked. I recommend that always, and we'll just stick with two. That's good two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Within Presenting to Win, is there one tip that sticks with you of here's something that helped me be a better presenter?

Sean Ellis (01:35:52):
Ultimately, confidence in presenting comes down to having very well organized information that you're going to present. And when you organize it correctly, you are much more likely to deliver it with confidence. And so he basically says, if I had a presentation to do and I had an hour to present, I'd spend 55 minutes creating the right presentation and then five minutes practicing it. But yeah, there's a lot more to it, but,-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:18):
Wow. Amazing. Okay. We'll link to that book in the show notes. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Sean Ellis (01:36:25):
Yeah, so I've been binging the Olympics. I love that, just watching people who worked their ass off for years and then maybe have 30 seconds to do the thing that they worked hard for. So Olympics have been awesome. And then the movie, I actually just saw Blackberry, I don't know if you've seen that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:42):
Oh, the story of the Blackberry?

Sean Ellis (01:36:45):
Yeah. I mean obviously we all kind of know the story, but it was so really, I mean, it's a classic example of product market fit and then not. Actually, it's probably even a counter example to the dangers of the how would you feel if we could no longer use this product? Pretty sure most people would've said on Blackberry, it's the keyboard, and until iPhone came along, the keyboard was super important and then suddenly it wasn't. But yeah, it's also interesting on egos and other things that everybody's getting friendly in the beginning and then egos take over and things get a lot harder later on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
That was actually a really good movie. There's also an amazing movie called Tetris. For some reason, I think of these two together,-

Sean Ellis (01:37:29):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:29):
About the story of Tetris, and it's a similar parallels to those two movies.

Sean Ellis (01:37:33):
Awesome. I'll have to see that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:35):
Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Sean Ellis (01:37:39):
I forget the name of it, but I think or it's called Pack Gear Hanging Suitcase, and I basically like, I've done almost 100,000 miles in travel this year, and I have another trip scheduled for next week, and I love it because it basically has all my clothes folded in this little insert that goes into my suitcase, and then I just pull it out and hang it up and just makes travel way easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:06):
It's called the Pack Gear Suitcase?

Sean Ellis (01:38:09):
Pack Gear Hanging Suitcase Organizer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:12):
So cool. Going to check that out. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to that you find useful in work or in life? Maybe share with friends and family sometimes.

Sean Ellis (01:38:22):
Focus on reputation and learning over earnings has served me super well that, and I'll give you an example. I had two companies when I was doing a lot of this early interim stuff yeah, 10 plus years ago, and I had two of them where I talked to the founders afterwards and I could tell they weren't that stoked on my contributions. And I offered a full refund to both of them with a thought that like I have this reputation that's, like I randomly pulled the number and said, my reputation worth $5 million. Why would I possibly mortgage that reputation for $20,000? And so one of them, I gave the check back to them and he was happy to take it, but he had said, "Oh, you can make it up to me. You don't have to give me the check, just make it up to me by continuing to help me for an unlimited amount of time going forward."

(01:39:20):
I was like, "Oh, take the check." And then the other one said, "No, no, I'm actually really happy with what you did. We're fine." But the two VCs who had made those introductions were the first two to give me term sheets when I went out to raise money for my company. And the pre-money ultimately ended up being valued at more than double what I had put my personal reputation at. So I, yeah, I think the, yeah, unfortunately the company didn't do that well itself because of the elusive product market fit challenges. But yeah, the learning there of just focus on learning and reputation. Reputation opened the door to more and more learning. And as I got more learning, the reputation grew. And so yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:04):
There's a really good corollary there with customer support. If someone just hates your product and wants a refund, just give them a refund and let them move on versus being upset.

Sean Ellis (01:40:12):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:13):
I love that. Final question. You mentioned to me before we started recording that you were maybe indirectly responsible for TikTok's success. Maybe share that story.

Sean Ellis (01:40:24):
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to overstate it, but I yeah, my trip around the world that I did three months ago, I think I wrapped it up. I met with the original founding growth team at TikTok. They're based in Singapore and they had, I can't remember what the previous product was called, but they started with the previous product. And then when TikTok came, they were in place to be the initial growth team for TikTok, and they basically said all the early stuff we did to grow TikTok was based on your writing. So that was before the book came out.

(01:40:59):
So it's a lot of just blogging that I had done, but it was really, really cool to get that feedback that, yeah, I've always said I have some really good wins, a lot of unicorns that I helped, but none of the really, really big guys. And then to hear that, it felt really good to know that I played some kind of role in TikTok. Of course, almost the same week they told me that that was Congress having TikTok ban conversations. So it was good. And at the same time, knowing that maybe if they hadn't read my stuff, Congress wouldn't be wasting their time on TikTok bans.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:36):
Oh man. Bittersweet. I hope they don't pull you into some hearings. Sean, this was incredible. This was everything I was hoping it'd be. I feel like we collected so much wisdom here for folks to them figure out product market fit, find product market fit, iterate, grow their products. So happy we did this. Two final questions. Where can folks find stuff that you're up to if they want to learn more and maybe work with you in various ways? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Sean Ellis (01:42:00):
Awesome. Yeah, so Seanellis.me is the website where I kind of link to all the things that I'm doing. And so that would be one place where, and there's contact forms on there if anyone wants to reach out. Obviously LinkedIn people can contact me there. And then I did mention GoPractice. So gopractice.io. Really cool way to learn growth through a simulated environment of being able to try to grow products. So check out GoPractice and maybe go to Seanellis.me. When this comes out, I'll put a special offer on there for Lenny's listeners so you can save some money.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:36):
And there's also a LLM AI kind of,-

Sean Ellis (01:42:40):
I wasn't directly involved on that one, but there's yeah, there's some other really cool stuff that Oleg and the team are doing. Data-driven product management, and the user growth programs are the ones that I helped with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:53):
Awesome. And then for folks, if they're wondering, do you do advising? How do you work with companies in case they're like, hey, I need Sean.

Sean Ellis (01:43:00):
Yeah, I mean, so the sweet spot for me on companies that I go hands-on with are ideally pretty early just after they get to product market fit and now you know how to measure it. So if you're kind of pre-scale, but you're seeing that 40%, or even if you're a bit earlier than that, we can start talking earlier. But to me, that's my favorite time to get in there, build it right from the beginning. It's so hard to retroactively do these things. And I'll go in for three to six months and I'm all in full-time, one of the team trying to really help build traction in the business. I do one of those every maybe year or maybe every year or two because I purposely burn myself out and then have fun doing more lecturing and workshops and stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:50):
Awesome. Well, you might get a flood of requests after this comes out. Hope you're ready. Sean, thank you so much for being here.

Sean Ellis (01:43:57):
Awesome. Thank you, Lenny. I really appreciate you having me on.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
Before you came on, I asked on Twitter, what should I ask Seth Godin? The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. How do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves?

Seth Godin (00:10):
AI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. What AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make a difficult promise, a remarkable promise, and then how do I keep it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26):
You wrote a new book. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it.

Seth Godin (00:31):
Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. What we do when we launch a new product, we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51):
There's the section that stuck out to me, these four insights that basically determine what your life is going to be like outside of actually building the product.

Seth Godin (00:59):
For a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11):
Today my guest is Seth Godin. Seth is an absolute legend. He's published 21 books, including 18 international bestsellers. He's been blogging every single day for almost 10,000 days in a row now. His writing and his advice have inspired me and so many people all over the world for the past few decades. He shares wisdom and advice around stuff that everyone can benefit from, including how ideas spread, when to quit, how to lead, how to stand out, and most of all how to change everything. In addition to his writing and speaking, Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. He also started the altMBA program, and as you'll hear in our conversation, he actually started his career as a product manager. In our conversation, Seth shares advice on how to know if you have good taste and how to build your taste, how to build a brand in an increasingly crowded world of AI startups and AI content, his thoughts on the Jaguar rebrand and also the Tesla Cybertruck.

(02:10):
We also delve into his new book, This is Strategy, including why every great strategy has tension at its center, why you need to understand the systems within which you operate in order to build a great strategy and how choosing your customers, your distribution strategy, and how you validate your idea will inform the product you build and the life that you live. We also talk about how he used Claude as a writing assistant in developing this new book.

Seth Godin (02:55):
What a treat, Lenny. Thank you for having me. Lenny was my late mom's nickname, so it's good to say that out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:02):
That's so cool. I've never heard it used for a woman, and every Lenny out there I've met is wonderful, so I imagine she's wonderful. First, I just want to say how honored I am to have you on this podcast. When I actually started this podcast, I was like, and I was listening to you on Tim Ferriss at that point, and I was like, man, what if one day I get Seth Godin on my podcast? How cool would that be? I've read so many of your books. I have a bunch of them in the bookshelf back there. I reference your stuff all the time, so thank you again for doing this.

Seth Godin (03:29):
Well, thank you. It's a treat to talk to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:33):

(05:18):
I want to start by asking a question that one of your former colleagues suggested I ask you. Wes Kao. I imagine you remember Wes?

Seth Godin (05:25):
Of course. Wes and I sat in a room just the two of us for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (05:29):
So what she suggested I ask you, and this question I love, is she... I asked her, what did you learn most from Seth Godin working with him? And she immediately said, it's helping her build better taste and increase her standards, having really high standards. So I want to ask you first of all, just how do you know if you have good taste and high standards and then how do you build good taste and higher standards?

Seth Godin (05:54):
Great question. Thank you, Wes. I define good taste as knowing what other people want just before they do. So if you're the only person who wants peanut butter covered licorice, you're entitled to eat peanut butter covered licorice, but you don't have good taste because everyone else thinks that's weird. And people, whether they're jazz musicians or fabric designers are seen as having good taste when they bring something to the world that the world didn't necessarily expect but is glad to see.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:25):
What do you find helps? So Wes learned from watching you that she realized, okay, my standards are not nearly as high as they could be. Other than working with you, maybe that's the answer is work with people like you that have really high standards. Just what do you find is most helpful in helping people build taste and also just increase their standards?

Seth Godin (06:46):
Standards, it's worth understanding what quality is and the people who listen to this podcast know better than most. Quality is not luxury. Quality is not perfection. Quality means meeting spec, and if you meet spec, you're done. If you don't think the spec is good enough, make a better spec. But if you meet spec, you're done. And so what it means to have high standards is that you relentlessly improve the spec in service of the people you're working with and for.

(07:16):
And what it doesn't mean is that you take something that meets spec and refuse to ship it because you're a perfectionist. That's hiding. And so what I learned at Spinnaker where I had my first job, real job as a product manager, was this idea that we weren't there to make perfect for us. We were there to delight the person who was buying the software. And our standards were untouchable. We said, "If that person, the one we're describing is delighted with what we shipped, it's good. And if they're not, it doesn't matter what kind of excuses we have." This is the opposite of what most people in this job do, which is they say, how do I please my boss? And if you're just doing your job, then don't expect to get rewarded for more than just doing your job because we can find lots of people who can just do your job.

Lenny Rachitsky (08:10):
That reminds me of one of your other really powerful pieces of advice about how no matter your job, this is a tangent, but it really stuck with me once I read your advice here is no matter what job you have, you couldn't love it, enjoy it, be amazing at it, even if you're just like a waitress or whatever. Can you just talk through that? Because that's so powerful.

Seth Godin (08:29):
Well, I think I got it from the late Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and the idea is there's no perfect job. A friend of mine, Tim, is a famous jazz saxophonist and he's got to schlep from city to city, and he's got to play to half empty rooms and he is got to deal with this and deal with this. So you're never going to have unlimited artistic freedom. But what we all have is the ability to understand where the boundaries of our work lie and go there.

(09:01):
And if you're a barista and you've chosen to be a barista, maybe because it's the best thing you could get, well you're not going to get the next hour over again. So what would it be like to be the best barista in the world for an hour? Would that be worth it for you? Because I've had menial jobs in food service and I got to tell you, when the boss forces you to be mediocre and bored, there's no amount of money they can pay you to do that job. But if you're there and you have a chance to add delight to someone's day, you're doing that for you, not because you're getting paid.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:34):
And you could totally tell these people in the world when you go to a barista that just you can tell, just loves their job. I know imagine she knows this is not her career long-term, but she just embraces it and just has fun with it. There's so much power to that. On a different note, you mentioned that you were product manager, which I did not know. That's amazing. So most of the people listening to this podcast are product managers. They're either product managers, founders, people that want to be founders, and then people that work with product managers. So first of all, I guess could you just share that part of your life? Because I don't think people know that.

Seth Godin (10:05):
All right. So the origin story could take all day, but I'm not going to tell the whole thing. I'm going to tell the part that I thought was normal that turned out to be the luckiest thing in the world. The summers between the two years of business school are very important to establish your career arc. I got a job at Spinnaker Software. Spinnaker invented educational computer games. I was the 30th employee. And the summer was spent doing assistant brand manager kind of stuff, going to meetings with the ad agency, writing copy. But at the end of the summer, they had a lovely going away party for me, because I was flying back to California. And then at the end, the president of the company, the chairman of the company and the head of marketing bring me into this side when they say, "We have a secret project, we want you to work for us while you're at business school and we're all going to pay you almost nothing."

(10:52):
"Okay, what's the secret project?" "We're going to do computer adventure games with illustrations and music based on science fiction novels, and we've already acquired the work of Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke." Now, I had read every science fiction book in the Clearfield Public Library from Asimov to Zelazny. This was a dream come true, but they thought my job was going to be make the packaging and run the ads. And what I discovered, first of all is that I couldn't really go back to business school. So I showed up hardly at all at Stanford and just took a lot of red eyes. But I discovered that the engineers, the development team, they had a lot of people vying for their time. And if I didn't figure out how to get them to give me way more than my fair share of development, I wasn't going to have any products to make next Christmas and then I was going to be out of a job.

(11:46):
And so I started a newsletter internally, I was one of the first people in the world to have desktop publishing because I was a beta tester for the Mac, and in it I would mention anybody in the engineering team who had worked on my project and I would say something good about them. And then I would print it out and put it in every single person's inner office mailbox. And within three months, four months, partly because the project was really good, 40 engineers were working for me and no one was reporting to me. And so I became the de facto product manager and that is when I learned marketing is the product. You don't make a product and then hand it to some marketing yahoo and say, go put a logo on this. That the product we made, and five in a row went gold, saved the company. Though product is why it worked.

(12:38):
And so I was supposed to know how to code but I didn't, but I could be in the room. The last month, RadioShack had bought how many units? 3000 stores times five times five, a lot of units. And if we had missed a date, they were going to cancel the order and the company would go bankrupt, and the software wasn't even close to done. And we didn't have any source control like we do now. There was no cloud, so it was all in my head. So I did not leave the office. I'm not exaggerating this, I did not leave the office for the last 22 days, slept for four hours a night upstairs, and if anyone had a question, I could tell them who to talk to.

(13:19):
That was so thrilling. It was so thrilling to make those decisions, to cajole this team, none of whom were in it for the money, to make something we were proud of. And then the stuff ships, everyone else goes home to sleep for a month, but I am the project manager and the marketing guy, so I got to stay at work. And the next day the phone rings and it's Herbie Hancock on the phone, the great jazz musician, and Herbie says, "The receptionist said you're the person in charge of Fahrenheit 451." And I said, "Herbie? I'm 24 years old, man. Herbie?" And he went on and on about how he had stayed up all night to play it and that he loved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:00):
I love how natural of a product manager you were in these things you shared of just thinking everyone deflecting credit and all these things. It's sign of a great PM. Along these lines, I wanted to ask actually, so you're a PM early on. Now, you obviously spend a lot of time marketing. I know you're saying there's obviously a strong connection between the two, but is there anything you find that people building the product most often miss or misunderstand that just annoys you or do you think they need to hear?

Seth Godin (14:26):
Maybe I got seven, but I'll try to do them off the top of my head. The first one is this, empathy is not about kindness and empathy is not an option. This is something that you are making for other people. So the whole idea of RTFM, read the manual, I'm angry at you. If you're saying that to your customers, you made a mistake, they did not make a mistake.

(14:49):
The second one is that the thing about projects is when you run out of time and you run out of money, the project is over. Don't run out of time, don't run out of money. Good intentions are no reason for an extension. The professional doesn't ask for an extension because the professional understands that things you didn't expect are going to happen. That's part of the deal.

(15:14):
And I guess the third one would be for software, particularly software as a service, if you don't build the network effect into what you are making, you are almost certainly going to fail. You cannot hope that Apple's going to pick you, promote you, and magically have you be successful. The question is, will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it? And if the answer is no, then why would they tell other people about it? And if they don't tell other people about it, no one's going to hear about it. But if the answer is yes, then your marketing problems pretty much solved.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:51):
I feel like each of these is its own book that we could talk through. And I want to come back to this last point and how it relates to the purple cow. I want to spend a little time there, but first I'm going to ask a marketing question. So before you came on, I asked on Twitter, what should I ask Seth Godin? He's coming on my podcast. I got a flood of suggestions. The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. Actually the co-founder of Intercom asked this question and it echoes what many people are wondering. So his question is how do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves in a world that's increasingly filled with AI companies, AI products, AI content?

Seth Godin (16:26):
Well, the first question is what's a brand? Because it's not a logo. A brand is a promise. It's what do I expect from you. It's would I miss you if you were gone. And Hyatt Hotels has a logo, Nike has a brand. The way we know this is if Nike opened a hotel, we'd know what it would be like. But if Hyatt decided to make sneakers, we have no clue. They might be comfortable, but that's all we would know. And so if you want to build a brand, you got to stand for something and you got to say what you don't do. And the second thing is AI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. That lots and lots of things run on electricity, but they're not electricity companies. They just happen to use electricity.

(17:13):
So what AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make? A difficult promise, a remarkable promise. And then how do I keep it? So making absurd promises might work at the VC level, but it doesn't work when you're talking to consumers because you can only break that promise one time. And so to wrap up the brand part, airlines don't have brands and airlines don't have loyalty. And the way we know this is that the only reason people stick with an airline is for the points, which is bribery. Loyalty is would you pay extra to stick with this? And if you wouldn't pay extra, then the brand has no value.

Lenny Rachitsky (17:58):
I love this phrase, make a promise and keep it. And the AI element, that raises the bar because many more promises are being made, fewer promises are probably being kept. So is the advice there, continue making an ambitious promise and then the key is actually deliver on that and that's what builds you brand?

Seth Godin (18:15):
Yeah. I have a very emotional connection to Claude.ai. I think they have a brand. ChatGPT's reputation with me is not good because it regularly over promises and under delivers and it does it without kindness or humility. Whereas Claude, I don't know how they did it, at least in my experience, brings kindness and humility. So when it doesn't know, it's very clear and it's not lazy and it's not angry at me. And so I happily pay extra for Claude because it has a brand. Whereas ChatGPT for me is just a tool that I use if I have no other options.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:55):
I love the Anthropic/Claude's billboards. "We're the ones without the drama." The AI company without the drama. I was going to save this to the end, but let's actually talk about it. So you mentioned somewhere that you actually use Claude to help you write this book and refine the book, which I think is going to increasingly happen. Could you just share that process of how you did that? What did you do that might be helpful to people to help you write this book?

Seth Godin (19:20):
Well, to be clear about my brand promise, because it's true, every word that has my name on it, I wrote. Every blog post, every book. I don't have a team. This is my whole staff is me. What I did with Claude and which I encourage people to do in the book is I would upload a list of four things and say, what did I miss? And it would suggest three things to complete the list. And often they would be things I hadn't thought of. And then I could go write about that or I would upload a couple chapters and I would say, what are the claims I'm making here that you don't think that I'm sustaining? And it became this patient editor that is so hard to find in the real world because editors aren't paid enough and given enough time to do their job right. And what I find is if I have a sentence that doesn't sound enough like me, I can ask Claude to help me figure out why that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (20:24):
I love that tactic of using it to figure out what you missed. I feel like you agree with this. I find that when I write, part of it is I'm putting an idea out there. I want to see what I got wrong and what I missed. And I like that you basically skip that step and don't put it out and just make the thing you put out actually better.

Seth Godin (20:42):
Well, the thing about blogging every day is at first it felt like how am I going to keep up? But once I could build a queue because I didn't want my streak to end-

Lenny Rachitsky (20:55):
How long is the streak at this point, by the way?

Seth Godin (20:58):
Post number 10,000 comes out at the beginning of 2025.

Lenny Rachitsky (21:02):
Oh my God. In a row.

Seth Godin (21:04):
In a row. Some days there were two. But what I found as I got a little bit of a queue is that I would feel bad because I had something to say, but I couldn't because there was already one in the queue. So I shifted from I have to write something to I get to write something. And now because I've taken the pressure off, I have time to rewrite it because I don't have a shortage of ideas for tomorrow. I have extra ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (21:34):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. But building these integrations in-house cost and average of three months of engineering according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Copy.ai, AI21 and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their pro and enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(22:41):
So let's talk about your book. You wrote a new book. It's called This is Strategy. I've been reading it over the past week and I've been so into it that I actually left it at my mother-in-law's house. I don't have it with me. So it's called, This is Strategy. It's about how to build strategy and develop a strategy. There's a lot to love about the book, but the section in the middle that is what most stuck out to me that I want to spend a little time on. You have this four sequence of advice that I love, so I'm just going to read it real quick. Choose your customers, choose your future. Choose your competition and choose your future. Choose the source of validation and you choose your future. Choose your distribution, and you're also choosing your future. Can you just talk through these four insights, these four steps that basically determine what your product and life is going to be like outside of actually building the products directly?

Seth Godin (23:31):
Yeah. And for a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them. You have probably assumed it's a given and you've sacrificed your agency over the four most important things you should be choosing. So the first one is picking your customers. If your motto is you can pick anyone and we're anyone, if your hope is that you have to win SEO to get anything, you're not going to succeed. When you choose your smallest viable audience, what language they speak, how much money they have, what problem they're trying to solve, what their technical facility is, whether they're short-tempered, whether they're kind, whether they're going to stick with you, you have chosen everything that's going to go into the product and what your future is going to be like. And so the Humane Pin people, whatever it was called, made a mistake when they picked their customers because they showed up like they had a finished Apple-quality product and they were trying to appeal to the kind of people that would buy on pre-order a finished Apple quality product.

(24:40):
When they shipped something that wasn't that, and they knew it wasn't that, they're doomed. Whereas if you say, here we are in Product Hunt, we're only looking for 400 people. We're looking for people who like the Raspberry Pi. Who wants to wonk with this thing? Now you can dance and you can have all these other things happen because you picked a different customer. If you decide to be a wedding photographer in the Hamptons, well you better expect to have some very spoiled, cranky brides and grooms, and grooms and grooms, and brides and brides, that you have to deal with because you picked your customers. Okay, so then the second one which comes with that is who's your competition? Because if you're competing against Walmart, why are you surprised that they keep lowering their prices? That's what Walmart does, right? That way you decide which space that you're going to operate in. You've built an enormous set of boundaries around what you do.

(25:36):
The third one is validation. If you are trying to please your boss, that's what you're going to do. If on the other hand, you can have one difficult conversation with your boss and say, can we agree that I'm not trying to match your taste, I'm trying to match the taste of these 400 people that we've agreed are our customers? Every other meeting is going to go way better from now on because you've made it clear who you're trying to please.

(26:01):
And the last one, choose your distribution matters a lot in the software business. For example, a video game, which is where I started, we were in Target and Lechmere and mass merchants. Our competitors were in Ziploc bags in computer stores. Well, when something like Steam shows up, when something like downloadable shareware shows up, everything about your product changes. So again, these four things are choices, and if you're glossing over them it's because you're afraid.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:33):
And I think it's important to note, it's not like you can just change these at will and just like, okay, cool, we'll change your distribution. These are intertwined. But the important point here that I hear is just make sure the product you're building understands this is how you'll be distributed. This is who you're selling to.

Seth Godin (26:49):
Yeah, I mean, so a friend just sent me a business plan. They're making a food product and they're saying, we're going to distribute on Shopify and we're also going to sell to businesses, airports, hotels, and people who need to sell the food. I'm like, there's only two of you. No, that's not what your business... You got to pick, today, before you even turn the page, who are you for and who are you not for?

Lenny Rachitsky (27:15):
Along the lines of picking your customer reminds me, a friend of mine started a company selling a product to real estate agents and she just warned me, be careful who you're selling to because you're going to be spending a lot of time with these people. Make sure you're ready to be doing that.

Seth Godin (27:28):
One of my very first books was a advertising supported directory paid for by law firms. This is not something I want to recommend to anybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (27:38):
Another great nugget from the book that really stood out to me is this idea of tension. The importance of tension. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it. Why is tension so important to a good strategy?

Seth Godin (27:53):
Okay, so let's agree that tension and stress aren't the same thing. Stress is generally not good. Stress is two things at the same time, I want to leave, I need to stay. Right? I hate my boss, but I need this job. That's stress. Don't look for stress. Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. Tension is it might not work. Tension is da-da-da-na-na, and the other person says, da-da. Because they need to finish the sentence.

(28:23):
So what we do when we launch a new product is we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them? And when I was a kid, PF Flyers were the sneaker to get, this was before Nike. And the promise of PF Flyers was that they would finally make you fast enough to run away from the bully. And I remember 10 years old walking into that shoe store and there was real tension in my head because I needed to get away from that bully, and I was keeping the PF Flyers people to their promise, and they didn't tell the truth.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:08):
It comes back to your point about not delivering on the promise that you make to build-

Seth Godin (29:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:13):
... A great brand, right? Okay, I want to take a little tangent into Purple Cow territory. I have your book right here, by the way. I have many of your books in the back, but I don't want to make my library... Oh, what is that? A milk carton?

Seth Godin (29:26):
This is the first 10,000 copies came in milk carton.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:28):
Oh man, I missed out on that. Was there any purple milk inside? What color is a purple cow's milk? We'll never know. We'll never know. I know you've talked about this concept a gazillion times. I feel like still people don't actually... Many people haven't heard it. Many people don't truly understand it, and it's the thing that I reference most of your piece of advice. Could you spend a little time just chatting about this topic of the Purple Cow, the importance of being remarkable?

Seth Godin (29:57):
Okay, so let's start with Steve Blank. I'm sure you've talked about his idea of customer traction. The single best way to tell if a startup's got any hope whatsoever is do the people who engage with you stick around? Do they come back for more? The second piece is, do they tell their friends? And if they tell their friends, what do they say? The word remarkable means worth making a remark about. So I'm not talking about coming up with some viral video that's ridiculous in its gimmickry. I'm saying if you make something where the person's life gets better if they talk about you and you know in advance what you want them to say, then they are more likely to say it. So Marissa Mayer probably created more stock market value than any other product manager I can think of. And the way she did it was there weren't very many people at Google, but she was the one who said, "No, you can't put another button on the homepage. There are only going to be two buttons on the homepage." And over and over and again.

(31:04):
At the time I was at Yahoo. Yahoo had the chance to buy Google for $10 million while I was there. That's a whole interesting story. But Yahoo had 183 links on the homepage and Google had two. And the statement built into that is we are making you a promise, and the promise is we are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing through 183 links. Tell us what you want and we'll take you there. And so I was a tech-forward person, and if a friend came to me lost on the internet, confused about something, I'd just send them to Google because I knew they wouldn't come back to me for more help, because okay, fine, they're gone. It's going to work. That's what to say about Google at its launch is, hey, just type in what you want and you'll find it. They built that into the product. That makes it remarkable because I wanted to tell other people about that because it would raise my status as a tech innovator.

Lenny Rachitsky (32:05):
And the implication here, and you talked about this, is that most likely the way you will win is word of mouth. It's hard to win with paid ads. It's hard to win with sales teams unless you're building B2B software. What you need to focus on is how to build something people tell their friends about. And the core of that is being remarkable. And I love just the way you break it down. Being remarkable is being something people remark about.

Seth Godin (32:30):
Yeah, and if you think it's just for small companies, that's how Microsoft beat WordPerfect, because Microsoft Word was the format you needed your coworkers to work in if you were using a modern computer, because if they insisted on using WordPerfect, then you were stuck with WordPerfect. Whereas they had a migration path and once you migrated, you didn't go back. So again, it's in my interest to insist you use Word. So I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (32:58):
This point about Mercer Mayer of doing this thing that was controversial, it comes back to your point of creating tension. It feels like it created tension both with visitors and internally. There's also these quotes that I have here that are along these lines that you've said in the past, I don't think they're in this book. If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try. And safety is risky. Is there anything you want to say there?

Seth Godin (33:22):
Well, so one of the things I talk about in the book is that systems are everywhere we look and they're largely invisible, taken for granted. I spend time with high school seniors talking about college. They don't see the college industrial complex. They just think it's normal, because that's what it is to grow up in the suburbs. And what systems do to protect themselves is they invent culture. Culture is the way things are around here. And so if you think something is scary, that's probably because the system wants you to think that.

(33:57):
And so you shouldn't do something foolhardy. You shouldn't be fearless. But what you should do is think about why does it scare me to do this? What system will be offended if I do that? Am I trying to work with the system or am I leveraged enough to help change the system? And so the first people who put up downloadable software, all the feedback was, you can't do that. It'll be pirated. You'll never make a penny. Okay. That might happen, and I can see why that feels scary, but I could also see why the dominant system of software distribution doesn't want me to even experiment with this. But I only worked on the software for five months, let's try it, because if it doesn't work and it gets pirated, I'll just have to make new software. It's okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:44):
It's interesting, the opposite of that was also true with Salesforce. Their whole pitch was no software. It's all in the cloud. Once that became the system, that became the tension and the risky move.

Seth Godin (34:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:56):
So you have this quote, actually. I want to spend more time on the system concept because it's so core to the book, and so core to your advice for how to be better, you have this actual quote. "What does it mean to be a strategic thinker? It means to see the system." What else can you share about it just for people that are trying to become better strategically, to understand what you mean when you talk about the system, how to see the system?

Seth Godin (35:18):
We have to invent systems anytime we engage with other human beings, because interoperability is essential. There's a system for how we greet other people in our culture. You shake hands, right hand to right hand. And just show up sometime and give the Vulcan salute instead and watch what happens. It's very awkward because we just needed to get this over with and now that's part of the system. And so systems serve a valuable function until they don't, because then the system starts doing things to support itself, to reinforce itself. So for example, there is a system that says we should interview people for jobs. And the most successful interviews are people where they show that they are like us, they look like us, they went to schools like us, they have privilege and background like us. That is toxic, because it diminishes not just diversity, but our ability to put real talent on the team.

(36:19):
And if you don't see that system and name that system, you're going to keep doing what you were doing. And I was talking to someone yesterday who said they had been working with a company and the last four people that they had hired had been captain of their Ivy League tennis team. Well, clearly there's a pattern here and it's being reinforced by people who don't want to get in trouble, but the system's not helping them. And so yes, we need the metric system and we need the zip code system. Those keep working really well. But if you are trying to show up in a place where dominant players don't want you to succeed, you're going to have to find something in the system that gives you a chance to change the rules.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:07):
This metaphor that I love that's along these lines of better waves make better surfers, that a lot of your success is driven by choosing the wave versus the skills that you have. Can you just talk about that?

Seth Godin (37:18):
Yeah. So it's surprisingly profound. I don't know where I came up with it, but when I see people who are great at surfing, they're almost always on good waves. And my son who surfs a lot, I have noticed, passes up waves that other people might take waiting for the right wave because he knows he will be able to surf it better. So when you think about which company you're signing up to bring software from, which people you're willing to put on the key roles, are you willing to wait for the superstar who's going to change things or are you in so much of a hurry to make an imaginary deadline that you're going to ship mediocre work? Because all mediocre means is average. And so if you don't want to be mediocre, you better do something different than the other people are doing. Otherwise, you're going to get what the other people are getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:10):
As you talk about this, I'm thinking about, I don't know if you saw Jaguar's rebrand and their whole launch. And it feels like it's been rejected by the system. Any thoughts on that? Maybe what they got wrong or maybe it was genius?

Seth Godin (38:24):
Okay, so you've picked a topic that I really like to talk about. Jaguar did not rebrand, Jaguar re-logo-ed. And the logo might be a sign that they're trying to rebrand and make a different promise, and they're switching to all electric, which I'm in favor of. But they made, I think, a very significant error, which is if you're going to start a car company, a hundred million or a billion dollars are going to get spent earning trust from people who never heard of you. If you're starting with one of the most iconic and beautiful and beloved car brands that has the luxury of having almost no cars in the world that could undermine what you want it to stand for going forward, it's perfect. Own that, that's brilliant. And to walk away from that so that you could please some art director, I don't understand why you think you're rebranding when you just put a logo on that undermines many of the awareness assets you already had going for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:28):
It feels like they got very, very controversial. They went against the status quo more maybe than they should. I don't know. What would you have done if you were them?

Seth Godin (39:36):
You may recall when the International House of Pancakes decided to falsely announce they were changing their name to the International House of Burgers and made a new logo, because they wanted buzz. This is a Wendy's Twitter tactic. Buzz does not sell hamburgers. Oreo's got a lot of buzz when they did that tweet about the Super Bowl blackout. There's no evidence they sold even one more cookie. They're not in the business of entertaining us. So Jaguar isn't going to sell more cars because people like you and I are talking about their re-logoing. What's going to make them sell cars is customer traction. What they need to do is find 50 people who have authority and get them in a car that changes them somehow, that transforms them.

(40:26):
And it's interesting if you think about two things that Tesla did right at the beginning with the model S. The first one is, according to someone I know who worked there at the time, the number one thing people would talk about when they saw you in the parking lot of the supermarket was the door handles, because the door handles popped out. They popped out in a way that's annoying and dangerous, but it was noticeable. So there was a conversation.

(40:52):
And then what would happen is they'd say, what do you think of it? And you'd say, get in the car and you'd switch to ludicrous mode and you'd drive at zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds and they'd start screaming. This was fun for you and told a story to the passenger. This is how customer traction begins because I can't do that in a different car, right? Compare this to the clown car, the Cybertruck, which was intentionally divisive and most people don't want to not only drive one but have one on their block because divisiveness is not selling. That what's selling is being of utility, to help someone get what they want. So here you have a category, the pickup truck, the number one category for all cars in the United States, just sitting there waiting to be taken. You can cross the chasm if you're someone like Tesla. And instead, they decide to pull a stunt, and that's not okay. It's not good product management. It's not good marketing.

Lenny Rachitsky (41:56):
Interesting. So you think Cybertruck are not going to be a success?

Seth Godin (42:00):
Well, I think, compared to what, right? So the Ford F-150 some years has made more than a hundred percent of Ford's profit, meaning without the Ford 150 pickup truck, there is no Ford. That's how big a category that is. You have a car with momentum and a public company where you've earned the trust of a lot of people. Now you have a category, pickup trucks, that are purchased for a very specific reason to show your neighbors you care about utility. Even if you never use the bed, that's the story of driving a pickup truck. So now, if you bring people in that category who are inherently skeptical of change and inherently skeptical of design trickery, something that is nothing but change and design trickery, no, they're not going to adopt it. You could have sold an enormous number of people who might've bought a Ford 150 instead. That crossing of the chasm is how you become really significant.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
I feel like this alone could be its own separate podcast conversation. I wish we had more time. I'm going to ask one last question, and this is a quote that I found of yours that I also love that is reminiscent of Elon Musk, actually, as we were just talking about this. "The secret to leadership is simple. Do what you believe. Paint a picture of the future. Go there. People will follow." Can you just talk about that?

Seth Godin (43:25):
I might be a little too glib because what I need to highlight is the painting the picture of the future needs to be based in empathy. You can't paint a picture of where you want to go. You have to paint a picture of where they want to go, and it's this non-narcissism that is where professionals do their work. That you are not entitled to raise money, you're not entitled to have market share, you're not entitled to get a good price because you worked hard. What we can do is be of service. We can open the door to help people get to where they always wanted to go. It's very difficult to change what people want, but it's pretty helpful to offer people a chance to get to where they always wanted to go in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:14):
Seth, this was a dream come true. I appreciate you coming on the podcast. I appreciate you saying that. Where can people check out your book? Where should people go to learn more about what you're up to? Anything you want to share.

Seth Godin (44:25):
So I'm not active on social media, but I do have a blog at Seths.blog. If you go to Seths.blog/TIS, you'll find everything you need to know about the book and the strategy deck and the collectible chocolate bar and whatever other thing I've dreamed up in the meantime.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:42):
Chocolate. Seth, thank you so much for being here.

Seth Godin (44:45):
These were great questions, Lenny, I could talk to you all day. Thank you,

Lenny Rachitsky (44:48):
I appreciate that. Same. Bye everyone.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):
Today, I am super excited to bring you a very special episode with Shreyas Doshi, recorded live at the Lenny and Friends Summit in front of 1,000 people in San Francisco. This is Shreyas' second time on the podcast. His first visit is the third most popular episode of all time of this podcast, and I love that Shreyas was game to try this.

(00:20):
In our conversation, Shreyas shares three questions plus a bonus question that he wished he'd asked himself sooner in his career. We talk about why product leaders are so busy, why the job is so frustrating, why it is so central to build good taste, and also why you're probably not listening as well as you should be. This was so much fun, a huge thank you to Shreyas for doing this.

(00:41):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Shreyas Doshi (01:01):
Thanks, Lenny, for having me. This is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04):
I was going to ask, we recorded our first episode, I think two years ago, and I was in a tiny room in my house. I don't know where you were, but it was very not like this. Thoughts on the setup of this episode?

Shreyas Doshi (01:18):
So first, the Lenny Empire keeps growing, which is amazing to see. And second, as I was coming up here, somebody told me this used to be a car dealership, and I actually realized I purchased my car here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34):
What?

Shreyas Doshi (01:36):
So crazy, only in SF.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38):
What kind of car was this? Say more.

Shreyas Doshi (01:40):
It was a Honda CR-V.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42):
Okay, wow. I am told this venue was also used for... Jimi Hendrix performed here, and Aretha Franklin performed here. So it's like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Shreyas.

Shreyas Doshi (01:56):
There we go, that's going up on my Twitter bio soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02):
Okay, so usually, when we talk, you're full of ideas and you're full of answers. When we were preparing for this, you told me, "I have questions, I have questions I want to ask."

Shreyas Doshi (02:16):
You know, reflecting on my career as a PM leader over the years, there are some questions I wish I had asked myself sooner, but I did not, and I had the great luck of having a life, a PM life full of suffering, and I have zero complaints about it. But as I look back, I feel like there are some questions that even if I asked myself some questions, those questions, I wasn't honest to myself about the answers. So that's what I thought I'd do, is share the questions that I wish I'd asked myself sooner.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:05):
Awesome.

Shreyas Doshi (03:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:06):
Love that, okay. This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like, Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(03:41):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features, like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native, customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Are native integrations on your product roadmap? Whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today.

(04:50):
But building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Coffee AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their Pro and Enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(05:37):
What's the first question?

Shreyas Doshi (05:39):
Right, so let's see, the first question is why am I so busy? Why am I so busy? And the background is that I have spent most of my career just being completely stressed out, just absolutely stressed out every day. And there were many reasons for it, but one of the core reasons was I was always super busy, and there was always work I felt like I couldn't do that I wanted to do, and so I would go home at the end of the day, and even if I had worked hard, I'd just feel dissatisfied.

(06:27):
And so that was a constant fixture of my life as a PM, PM leader, and it's only... So I did product work for about 20 years before I started this new chapter of my career. And I think I only fixed it in the last three or four years of my career as a PM leader. But that means that there were about 16 or 17 years where I was just incredibly busy, and because I was incredibly busy, I was extremely stressed, and even though I was doing a good job, I was not feeling very good inside. And then, that showed up in my body, like all sorts of pains and aches I realized were actually not physical pains and aches. They were pains and aches from the stress.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:15):
It's like health issues that you had?

Shreyas Doshi (07:16):
Yeah, yeah, minor stuff. I mean, relatively minor stuff, but playing tennis, and you pull your back muscle, and now you are horizontal for three days, doesn't feel good.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:31):
Who here is very, very busy, and is just way too busy? Raise your hand.

Shreyas Doshi (07:36):
That's it?

Lenny Rachitsky (07:36):
Yeah, I know.

Shreyas Doshi (07:37):
Whoa.

Lenny Rachitsky (07:39):
Everyone's like [inaudible 00:07:39] everybody. Yeah, people were like, "Yeah, yeah. I don't have to raise my hand, I'm busy." Yeah. Okay, keep going.

Shreyas Doshi (07:50):
Yeah, and so here's the thing, when we talk about being busy, and managing your time, energy, all of that, I mean, this is a group of senior product people, so you all know that. Take tips and techniques, like maintain a to-do list. I found the LNO framework very useful for me, which I've shared before. I used to like working out of a calendar, those types of things. And I think you're all familiar with those things, but what I wanted to call out is that, at some point in our product career, we reach something, we reach an immovable force that will just overwhelm us, no matter what we do.

(08:39):
And that force is a scope. Okay, so as we grow in our product career, our scope grows, and we kind of like that, which is all great, but at some point, if you haven't already gotten there, many of you have, but for those of you who haven't, you will get there, where your scope will be so large, that no matter what you do in terms of efficiency, whatever framework you use for prioritization, whatever framework or tool you use to manage your to-do list, whatever tools and techniques you use, whatever prioritization you do, your scope is so large that you are still going to be incredibly busy.

(09:21):
And so that's what I faced, like I was saying for the first about 16, 17 years of working on products, and only in the last 3 or 4 years was I able to kind of find some answers on how to deal with that scope. And so perhaps we can talk about that, what do you think?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:43):
Yeah, so you're basically saying there's all these productivity tricks, ways to do more faster. And no matter how many of these tools you've got, you are just going to take on more and more work, and they'll peter out? I'll say many of my most popular newsletters posts are, "Here's productivity tricks and tips." And so people are always looking for these. And I'm curious to hear where you go with this, of just like that is not the answer long term, there's a different approach?

Shreyas Doshi (10:08):
Yes, and so the challenge is the following. How many of you are going through some kind of annual planning right now or you're planning on going through annual planning? Please. Everybody loves annual planning, great. So let's take annual planning. If you are a high-level manager, leader within a company, what does your month look like? Or in some cases, unfortunately, what do your two or three months look like when you are going through annual planning? It's all these kind of spreadsheets to fill out, and meetings to have, and dependencies, and priorities, and stakeholders to meet, and so on. And so I noticed, for instance, that at some point, that was making me really busy, and then that was making me feel guilty now, because I had my team to look after and to support, and then I had product decisions to make and various other things, and I've gone on some planning retreat or whatever.

(11:15):
And there you go, you last four, five, six, weeks, does that sound familiar to folks? Yeah? Okay, so I noticed that I needed to change that at some point, and actually found a solution, again, late in my career, but I found a solution, because I asked myself this question, which is, "Why am I so busy? I'm doing all the efficiency things, I'm managing my to-do list like a champ. I have my calendar set up just right. I have my routine set up just right. I'm working out so that I'm engaged at work, I'm productive, I'm doing all of that. Why am I so busy? Oh, it's planning season, and that is supposed to take up four to six weeks." And this was at Stripe when I encountered this. So that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.

(12:03):
Well, I realized that you don't have to do that. And so at some point in my time at Stripe, what I realized is the following, we go through a whole all sorts of just rituals around planning for four to six weeks. Then, we emerge and we share our plan with our executives. You know the questions they're going to ask, like, "If money were no concern, what would you do? What is your ambitious plan? So if we gave you five more engineers, what would you do? What other things would you include in the roadmap?" Right? The standard stuff. And so you emerge, you do your presentation, and then you publish the plan, and then you start the new year with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement. And January goes fine, until you get three customer escalations for features that were not in your plan. And so now, you try to figure out how you're going to revise resources.

(13:03):
You go talk to some dependency team that's going to sort of support these new features from these customer escalations. And you go through that process, and you revise your plan again. And then, usually by the time it's last week of February, everybody's forgotten the actual plan. And now, we are executing off of some other list somewhere. And by the way, when you mention this at times, politely of course, you might mention like, "You know, I'm noticing we are not actually really using the plan that we spent four to six weeks minimum doing." And then, some smart person in the room chimes in with, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything."

(13:52):
I don't know, Eisenhower, somebody else, I don't know who said this, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything." Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what that means, but everybody appreciates, "Ah, plans are useless, but planning is everything." Right? So I went through a few years of this. And then I go, "You know what? I'm going to bend some rules here." And so what I realized, Lenny, is you don't have to go through these four to six weeks, and it was an accident. Basically, what happened is around that time, the product I was working on, Stripe Connect, it's like a major product for Stripe, major, major business for Stripe. And I had put together a product strategy, like a real product strategy for this product.

(14:44):
And so this must have been earlier in the year. And so now, planning season came along. And the interesting I found is that because I had a real product strategy, not one of those fake ones, a real product strategy that I had gotten alignment on with everybody, my planning for this major product for Stripe took me like three days. Right, so while a lot of my peers, unfortunately, for their own products, were in this four-to-six week cycle of planning, and meeting, and blah, blah, blah, I just put it all together in three days, and whatever artifacts were needed, I put them together.

(15:27):
I did not fill out some templates. That's where it's about bending the rules, because if a template doesn't make sense, why should I fill it out? There's no need to fill it out. And so that's when I realized that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away. Now, you still have to do some resource allocation and all of that, but even there, you don't need that false precision. How many of you have gotten into arguments about, "So should it be eight engineers for this team in 2025, or nine engineers for this team in 2025?"

(16:11):
Like, who cares? We all know that even those numbers that we set up, we don't actually follow through on them, as 2025 happens. So that's just an example of where we spend a lot of time on things that we think are strategic, that we think are important, but actually, we ought to spend that time on other much higher leverage things. Right, now it does require some upfront work, in this case upfront work on a clear product strategy that everybody understands, that everybody's aligned on. But frankly, if you have that, planning should be a breeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:49):
So what would be your kind of tactical tip for folks that want to do this better? I know there's probably a billion examples of these sorts of things you shared, so planning is an example. Folks that want to be less busy, maybe on that one is it give yourself very little time, and focus on strategy, and let that be the plan, basically, versus every single person and their roadmap for the next six months. What's the piece of advice you'd share there? And then, I want to move on to the next question, because I want to make sure we get through all these questions.

Shreyas Doshi (17:18):
Yes, there's definitely a specific tip, which is if you do have a strategy that will make a lot of your prioritization problems go away, it will make a lot of planning problems go away. And even if you do have some escalation from sales, which you will, or from support, or somewhere else, you now have at least a more rigorous framework to figure out what to do with that escalation. So there's definitely that.

(17:48):
But I think other thing I want to share is that, and this was my other realization as I asked the question, "Why am I so busy?" is I realized that I am so busy because I'm not making good product decisions. Okay, now, you have to understand, by this time I'm like 15 years into building products and whatever, 11 years into being a product manager. And so I think I'm pretty good. That's my kind of self-image. But then, again, if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not making as good product decisions as I can. So can I share an example of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (18:32):
Please.

Shreyas Doshi (18:34):
So what I noticed is that you have a meeting about some product feature that somehow is requested or is really important, whatever the case might be. And so you have a meeting with some stakeholders and your engineering team, designers, et cetera. And then, you're trying to decide, "Should we build this or not?" And somebody says, "You know what? Why are we doing a meeting for this?" I read somewhere or I heard Bezos say that two-way doors, it's a two-way door. You quickly make a decision. Like, just quickly make a decision and move on. This is a two-way door. And so you say, "Yeah, that's right." And any time we hear something like that, two-way door, you're like, "Oh, that person's really smart, so I want to be like them."

(19:32):
So I noticed that myself and my team, we were making these kinds of decisions without very clearly thinking through customer motivation, very clearly thinking through differentiation, very clearly thinking through a distribution approach for whatever this feature is. And while it sounds like, "Oh, of course you should be doing this," I guarantee you this is not how most product teams work. They're talking about, "Well, is Bob the engineer going to be free? And when are they free? And if they are free, then let's build the feature." That's kind of how a lot of product decisions happen.

(20:11):
The challenge here with this kind of approach, and again, this is what happens in practice, I'm not talking about whatever theory you read, this is what happens in practice. So when you follow this approach and you assume that, "Oh, this is a two-way door, we can kill the feature," in reality, it doesn't work out that way, because here's what happens in reality. So in reality, you commit to the feature, and it's going to take five, six weeks to do it, and then a couple more weeks to make sure, to ramp it up, et cetera, right? And so now the feature is out, and now you have your Q1 QBR, right? Say two months from now you have your Q1 QBR, and you're going to present your business review, whatever. You're going to present what you did, "What did you do last quarter? How are your ships performing from last quarter?"

(21:03):
And so now, it's time to talk about this feature at the QBR, because you have to share that/ Now as you start talking about this feature, the CEO will ask, "So yeah, we launched the feature. I'm very glad we launched this feature. How is it doing?" And you want to be able to say, you are the PM leader, you want to be able to say something smart, and something that makes you look competent. But the challenge is the feature hasn't had much adoption. So I'm not going to ask anybody to raise hands, but I think most PMs are familiar with this conundrum. And of course, we are verbally very agile as product leaders. So what we say is we don't have data, so we use favorable anecdotes.

(21:53):
And so we say, "Yeah, we launched the feature, and you know what? This customer from this company really loves the feature." And we put in an anecdote, it's like, "Life-changing feature." It doesn't matter that they're the only person using it. That doesn't matter. "Life-changing feature," right? We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us. So anyway, so we present that. Now. we do have the sales counterpart in the room too, our sales counterpart, and they say, "You know what, though? We are still not winning many deals because of this feature." And so of course the CEO asks, "So what's up? Why aren't we winning deals, even though we have the feature?"

(22:30):
So the people on the customer side usually we respond, "Well, I'm glad we have the feature, but it's not full featured yet. We need all these other bells and whistles to meet the table stakes." So now, what happens? Somebody uttered the word, "Meet the table stakes." Now, it's over for you, because now, the only response you can give is, "Oh, yeah, that's already part of the plan." And now, you put your engineering leader on the spot and you say, "Alice, isn't it? Haven't we allocated engineers to it already?" And so now, Alice has to come up with some response, which is like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carol and David are going to work on it. It's slotted for one of these sprints."

(23:19):
And so now, you exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, "Good job, team, great job," et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature. So I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy.

I know it's Spotify, I heard one of their core values is, "Talk is cheap," but it's the virtue version of that. It's like, they actually prefer to talk more, and I think that's exactly what you're saying. Basically, spend more time on these things that seemingly seem just small little ideas and experiments.

Shreyas Doshi (25:37):
Yep, thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:41):
Amazing. Shreyas, what's your second question?

Shreyas Doshi (25:45):
Yes. So my second question, I have to get the words right, do I actually have good taste? Do I actually have good taste is my second question. And for me, I asked this question after, again, all of these things... By the way, everything I say, I have been that guy, I've made that mistake. So that's why I just have to admit to myself that, yes, I have made these mistakes. And one of the mistakes I made, this was when I was at Google, and I was relatively new to product, about less than five years. And at Google, there's some parts of Google where you would be told as an early career PM that like, "We don't do strategy here. Strategy is for MBAs, okay? We are all about execution, okay?"

(26:47):
So I'm in this environment, I'm naïve, and I look around me and I'm like, "Google is the most successful company on the planet," at the time, and they are saying this, and I'm hearing this consistently, so it must be right. It must be right. And so I start saying it. I start saying, "Oh, yeah, execution is everything, and we don't do strategy around here." And I even remember there were not that many PMs, but there was a PM at Google who was kind of like the same level as me, but he just had much more wisdom than me. And he was trying to nudge me into... Like, I was managing a product. And he's like, "Shreyas, what is your strategy here?" And I was like, I told him the same thing. Like, "Oh, no, no, what are you talking strategy? We don't need strategy. We just need to get shit done." That was the thing.

(27:42):
And so I kept repeating that mantra until I got to Twitter. So this is Twitter right after their IPO. And I saw Twitter had an incredible asset, which is the product and the network effects. It had other incredible assets, including the brand. It had other assets that were great, including the talent. And yet, this company was struggling, the product was struggling. And even if it wasn't struggling, it was making a lot of money. But the point is it was not meeting its potential. So that's when I realized, and it wasn't like some sudden realization, it took me six to nine months of being at Twitter. This is circa 2014. That's when I realized that, "Oh, my gosh, Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy."

(28:38):
Now, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. So that's when I realized the folly of like, "Oh, wait a minute..." I was at Google six years. I spent most of those six years saying like, "Ah, strategy's useless. There's no point to strategy. Execution is where it's at. "I'm like, "No, actually, I was wrong." And that got further solidified as I went to Stripe, and I was kind of now growing earlier stage products and trying to make them highly, highly successful. I saw an even greater value and importance of having a clear strategy. And so that made me realize, basically...

(29:29):
You know, we talk about taste, we all talk about taste, and it's about the beautiful pixels, and the perfect product, and the whatever else, the Steve Jobs-esque passion, and all of that, whatever it is. And yes, taste is about that, but I think there is something that we as product leaders, and certainly I did, needed to recognize about taste as just a factor in pretty much everything we do, which is like, do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders? And then, those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions. And so it's that taste I'm talking about when I say, "Do I really have good taste?"

(30:28):
And when I asked myself this question, and again, I really had to dig deep. It wasn't easy, but at some point I realized that no, actually, I don't have good taste. I don't have good taste in how I choose to evaluate things that come my way. Again, not in terms of the product, because by that time I had skills to say, "Well, this should not be a two-step flow. This should be a three-step flow," whatever the case may be. But I still did not have good taste in terms of how I choose what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learned from, what content I resonate with? And then, I went on this journey to try to develop that better taste.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:21):
What I'm hearing is people focus maybe too much on the output, like the experience, these experience design taste versus what they choose to take in as informing their taste, and what they see as an example of great and correct. Is that what you're saying?

Shreyas Doshi (31:37):
Yeah. And look, taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results, because, look, it requires zero taste right now for anybody to say, "Oh, that CEO of NVIDIA is a genius, right? Jensen is a genius." If you are saying that in 2024, it actually requires zero taste, because you can just look up NVIDIA stock price. It requires zero skill. But to be able to say that in 2010, you have to realize Jensen Huang didn't change much between 2010 and 2024. So Lenny, even in sports, there's this saying, "Game recognize game," and that's about taste.

(32:59):
But what we need to understand is it's game recognize game before the game is called, right? Like, game recognize game in the practice session. Because it takes no genius right now to say, "Well, Patrick Mahomes is great quarterback," or, "Virat Kohli is a great cricketer," or whatever else. It requires no genius to do that. It requires zero taste. So I also believe some of us, especially as we get more senior, and we get more successful, and we just get a lot more scope, and responsibility, and a lot of accolades, we become these tough graders. Like, "I don't like anything," right? Like, "Ah, this is crap, this is crap, this is crap." Again, that requires zero taste. Anybody can say that. Anybody can just say, "Everything is horrible."

(33:53):
So I do think there is something about being able to understand that, and I think I'll share some examples. This two-way door thing, so let me just share a few observations, if I might. So the first one is we get overly excited about cool metaphors, okay? Like, one-way door, two-way doors. There's some guy, I don't know who it is, I just read somewhere, there's some guy who had written a blog post about this idea, but he called it reversible and irreversible decisions, and it was the same idea. And I think somebody was lamenting that that did not catch on, reversible and irreversible decisions. But what caught on is two-way door and one-way door. What's the difference? The only difference is you got attracted to the catchy metaphor, and the other one is the authority bias, because Bezos said it.

(34:58):
Take another example, we get very impressed with alliterations. I'm serious, we get very impressed with alliterations. Okay, so how many of us love fail fast? Fail fast, okay, nobody's going to raise hands now. Okay, fine. Maybe you truly don't love fail fast. How about fast follow? How many of you love fast follow? Let's consider that, like fail fast, "We're going to fail fast." What if that thing were called fail quickly? It's the same meaning. Do you think you would be as attracted to that idea if it were called fail quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (35:44):
No.

Shreyas Doshi (35:46):
Probably not, so what changed? The only thing that changed is one is an alliteration. So I see this in everything. Like, let's see, the other one is we also get very impressed with complicated charts and math we don't understand. And some of you product leaders who are at the top of the game, you actually use this as a strategy. So as I realized that here's the outcome of that, asking myself that question, was that what I realized is everybody says, "Oh, I'm a first principle thinker. I am a rigorous thinker," whatever.

(36:41):
But I realized that if I really want to be that, I have to shed a lot of these just patterns that were just built in me, and I kind of have to evaluate the idea separate from all of its social proof, and authority proof, and whatever else. And that ended up being a meaningful change in my growth as a product leader, because the moment I started shedding these kinds of social proofs, and authority proofs, and all of that, it just made me a much... We all again think we are critical thinkers, but we are not, right? So it made me a more critical thinker.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:31):
I want to move on to the next question, just so we can get through some of these questions. Before I do, can you just show people your notes real quick, just like show it from a distance? This is how Shreyas plans for something like this. There's color coding, I wish I understood what was going on there.

Shreyas Doshi (37:49):
People ask me, "What's your favorite note-taking app?" It's a common question I get, and I say this, right? It's a $5... Like I guess the pen costs $3, and I think the Office Depot clipboard costs-

Lenny Rachitsky (38:00):
Wait, doesn't that pen... Does it have the different color clicky thing?

Shreyas Doshi (38:02):
Yes, yes, yeah. A [inaudible 00:38:04]. Yeah, exactly. This is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:06):
That's going to be another podcast episode. Okay, so we want to try to do two more questions. We have six minutes left. The last one's a bonus, so maybe we touch on it briefly. Shreyas, what's your third question?

Shreyas Doshi (38:18):
So my third question is why does my job feel so frustrating? Why does my job feel so frustrating? And it goes back to the point that, look, I loved, loved my PM leadership job. I just absolutely loved it. And I think looking back, I would not have exchanged it for anything else, any other experience. That said, there were daily frustrations. There were daily frustrations in that job, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely. The PM's job, the PM's on your team, their job is also lonely. But a PM leader's job is further lonelier. So there's that. There's also what I learned at the time when I started asking this question is that our jobs get frustrating when we behave, most of the time, in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core.

(39:32):
Okay, so for me, as I was evaluating that question, it's like, "Why am I getting frustrated every day? I love the job, I love the macro, but I do not like the micro. And so why is that?" And that's when I actually... There's a simple framework that I've shared, which is you can be doing your work at three levels. Product work happens at three levels. There's the impact level, there's the execution level, and there's the optics level. My epiphany as I was exploring this question was I have a preferred level at which I like to operate, but if most of the day, and most of the week, and most of the month, I am forcing myself to operate in not my happy place, in my non-default level, that makes me very frustrated.

(40:33):
So many product leaders, their happy place is the execution level. In my case, my happy place is the impact level. So that is fine. Your happy place can be whatever level, it doesn't matter. But the point is, as you go higher up in the corporate ladder, no matter what kind of company it is, you are now going to have to spend a lot of time on optics, at the optics level. And I have willpower, I have the skills to do it, I have all of that. So it's not about willpower or skills, but willpower is finite. So as I spent day in and day out, just mostly doing optics work, I realized I was not happy and I was getting frustrated. And so that's when I realized the solution, which is I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, "Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects. This is what my mom expects. What will people say on LinkedIn when they see my LinkedIn profile?" Like, "Oh, he has this progression, this, and then what stopped? Why did it stop?"

(41:49):
So when I realized this, I said, when a team grew to a certain size, so when I was at Stripe and I realized this, when the team I was managing, it had a fan out of about 50 people, so this includes engineers and everything, I said, "This is enough." Because for me, any time a team goes to like 50s, and 100s, and beyond, it is a law of corporations that you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the optics level. So instead of just pushing, pushing through against who I truly am, what did I do? I just went back to more of an earlier stage product, and then I was fine with like, "You know what? I'm not going to just play the corporate game," as an example.

(42:34):
So I guess my suggestion would be identify your superpowers, and like Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true." Just be honest to yourself. Operate your career and make your career decisions not out of expectation, not out of envy, like the LinkedIn envy of like, "Oh, this person is at a different level. We both went to the same grad school, so I got..." No, identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life. You will love it, and you will be great at it, and you won't have that frustration.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:23):
I wish we had an hour for every single one of these questions, I feel like there's so much more to get into. We have 40 seconds. Do you want to touch on your last question or do you want to leave that for a follow-up discussion?

Shreyas Doshi (43:35):
Let's touch on it, let's touch on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:37):
Okay, we got to go though in 30 seconds.

Shreyas Doshi (43:38):
All right. My last question is am I really listening? Okay, and this is perhaps the hardest one for me, because I thought, of course I'm a good listener because I listen, then I recap, and I make eye contact, and I tell them, "This is what I heard," And all of that nonsense. I realized there is an entirely other level to listening, which once you understand that there's an entirely other level to listening, that is what enables you to be a world-class leader. And so that is what I guess my last takeaway is, is ask yourself, "Am I really listening?" If you want resources, there are very few people who actually talk about what that real listening means. I would refer you to what Rick Rubin says about listening, I would refer you to what [inaudible 00:44:30] said about listening, and what Drucker said about listening as some pointers.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:36):
Amazing. Shreyas, you said you were going to hang out for the next hour somewhere. You want to share that real quick, and then we'll get off?

Shreyas Doshi (44:42):
Yes, I will maybe try to hang out in the back part of the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:46):
Be quiet back there, too.

Shreyas Doshi (44:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:47):
Shreyas, thank you so much for being here.

Shreyas Doshi (44:50):
Great, thank you. Oh, should we take a picture?

Lenny Rachitsky (44:54):
Oh, yeah. We're going to take a quick selfie.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
We're going to take a picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:59):
There we go. They're going to turn lights on, I think.

Shreyas Doshi (44:59):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (45:00):
Okay.

Shreyas Doshi (45:03):
All right, folks.

# Product lessons from Waymo | Shweta Shrivastava (Waymo, Amazon, Cisco)

## Transcript

Shweta Shrivastava (00:00):
Are you proactively trying to challenge your own assumptions is extremely important, right? As a big enough product manager as well as a seasoned product leader, if you're not doing enough of that, then I think you might not be listening. If there's no conflict, if there's no contention, then something is missing.
Lenny (00:20):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Shweta Shrivastava. Shweta is senior director of product management at Waymo, which if you're not familiar with Waymo, they're building self-driving cars that already live on the streets in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix. I actually got to take a ride in one ahead of this chat and you'll hear all about that in this episode.
(00:48):
Before joining Waymo, was chief product officer at Nauto and AI started focusing on driver automation safety. Before that, she was head of product management at Amazon Web Services for their database and analytics services, and before that she was at Cisco. In our conversation, we delve into what it's like to work as a PM at Waymo and how it's both different and similar to software only products.
(01:09):
We talk about their KPIs and goals at Waymo, including how they track progress towards a future of self-driving cars, how they build subtle cues and behaviors into the cars to create trust for the rider and also for other cars on the road. Plus Shweta's biggest lessons about building products and teams across the many companies she's worked at. I can't wait for the future of every car being self-driving, and it was super fun to learn about what goes into making this all happen. With that, I bring you Shweta Shrivastava after a short word from our sponsors.
(01:40):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Com, Quora and Modern Treasury Trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and many more.
(02:07):
Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders. Over 5,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2 and these other frameworks. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(02:38):
This episode is brought to you by public.com. We want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasury yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account.
(03:09):
You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.
(03:47):
Shweta, welcome to the podcast.
Shweta Shrivastava (03:49):
Thank you. Great to be here.
Lenny (03:52):
It's great to have you. I thought we'd start with just a little bit about what it is you do at Waymo today. What are you and your team's responsible for at Waymo?
Shweta Shrivastava (04:02):
Yes, my team's responsible for three key areas, I would say. One is building a big part of the software that actually runs on board the fully autonomous vehicle and that determines the actual behavior and trajectory of the vehicle. Secondly, building the simulation tools and technologies that are required to validate the performance of the system. And then, a third one of the teams focused on commercially scaling our ride-hailing business, which is one of our key go-to market applications for the technology we're building.
Lenny (04:34):
So as you know, I arranged a ride for me in a Waymo in San Francisco. It was actually a really rainy day and it was quite mind blowing. I've never been in a self-driving car that had no driver sitting in the front. I have a Tesla and I turn on self-driving sometimes, but I've never experienced just sitting in the back and this thing just raises you around. Also, just like a memory hat is the app to call the Waymo, it feels like Google Maps except instead of just telling you how to get to a place like a car shows up and just takes you there and then you could change course as you're driving and it's crazy how quickly it became normal.
(05:08):
I'm just like, all right, we're just riding around San Francisco in this self-driving car and just sitting in the back and telling you where to go. And so anyway, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions around this, but I guess thank you for arranging that ride. It was quite special.
Shweta Shrivastava (05:21):
No, I'm glad that you were able to do that on a rainy day. So that's a special bonus because, again, the technology has been performing very well, which has been very heartening for us to see.
Lenny (05:30):
A few questions along these lines, one thing that I noticed that was really cool is we're trying to turn into a lane and there's cars coming in that lane just continuing to move and the car just kind of subtly was inching its way out, communicating through this interesting body language thing of just like, can someone let me in? And it's interesting, there's no eye contact involved and it's just like this, I don't know, gesture that you all have to develop.
(05:54):
And so, I guess, the question here is just like what have you all learned? And I don't know if you even work on that piece of it, but just, I'm curious how you think about creating this body language of the car communication system to help people understand what it's trying to do.
Shweta Shrivastava (06:07):
We're using a lot of human driving data to train our deep models. So it's important to make sure that the behavior of the car doesn't seem robotic, it can feel quite unnatural. And from the get-go, we focused on building a fully autonomous system. So it's important to have that familiarity, that trust, building with the riders where they're not daunted by technology, they don't feel like they're sitting in our walk. It has to feel very human-like, but in a good way. Making it safer than human driving, but then not making it feel unnatural.
(06:40):
And so we have deep learned models that can understand what the other road users' intent is. So, stuff like which way the pedestrian is looking or what is their body orientation because that could tell you which way they're headed. The road signs or the gestures, somebody is trying to stop the vehicle. The system can understand all those signals.
(07:04):
So because we're using deep learn models trained on human driving, but again sort of in a good way. We discard the bad human driving data. We can mimic human driving behavior in a good way and that's why you saw the behavior that you saw yesterday. Now, one thing to note is we can't also just completely rely on explicit gestures and signs because a lot of driving has also social norms. If you're in a pretty clear section in San Francisco, maybe it's okay for pedestrians to cross even when they don't have a walk sign.
(07:43):
Another city, another intersection might have a different social norm when it comes to pedestrians crossing the four-way stop sign or the crosswalk or what have you. And so, the car also has to learn about those social norms and be able to react to it. So, like I said, we don't realize how sophisticated, how interactive and how social driving really is. And with our artificial intelligence capabilities, we have been able to incorporate a lot of that into our system behavior.
Lenny (08:14):
So before Waymo, you worked at non self-driving software companies, you worked at Amazon, Cisco, a few other companies. I'm curious what you've found to be the biggest difference working in a company like Waymo versus a traditional software company.
Shweta Shrivastava (08:29):
As I said earlier, it's a highly complex, technically complex, system that we have built and we're improving. And if I may say, it's the most game changing product that anybody would ever work on.
Lenny (08:43):
I don't know, Amazon's pretty cool, but I totally get you.
Shweta Shrivastava (08:46):
I worked at Amazon, I'm a fan. And they have been pretty transformational with AWS and on the eCommerce side. But a fully autonomous driving system, it's also a very, very hard problem. So it's transformational from that perspective too. I would say that the PMC has to be able to go technically indeed, compared to what they would do in other software products. They have to be able to get into the details as much as needed. They have to be okay with uncertainty and ambiguity.
(09:24):
Again, I think, that is part and parcel of any product management role, but it's even more so here. This is a long game and so you have to have the tenacity to play the long game and be continuously improving the product and make this thing a broad reality and future. So, those are some of the attributes. I would also say that there is some level of self selection here. You have to be driven by the mission to make the roads safer. We have about 1.35 million debts that happen every year across the world from traffic accidents and most of that is attributable to driving errors and driver distraction.
(10:04):
I've been guilty of checking my text messages while driving. I've seen other drivers do that. But a fully autonomous technology, you don't have that risk. That's the risk we're trying to minimize. So they have to be driven by that mission. One other thing is that the concept of MVP, which is so widely popular in the SaaS product management world or product management world, in general, has a whole new meaning here at Waymo when you work in a product like this because safety is on top of mind for all of us and can't really cut corners on safety.
(10:42):
The MVP bar itself for safety is extremely high for us. So, the core product management philosophy also, getting an MVP out there and then iterating with the real world deployment. It applies, but it's just a different bar on that MVP.
Lenny (11:03):
Touching again on safety and human behavior, I was thinking a little bit as we're chatting about, say of Tesla, which has self-driving car, self-driving capabilities and intellectually I know it's probably going to drive a lot better than I am, but I still feel like I need to disengage it occasionally when I'm on a curvy road. I'm just like, I don't know about this, I don't want to leave room for error if there's something that weird that happens.
(11:30):
And I imagine someone designing product for that weird behavior where I should probably trust it because it's probably a lot better driver than I am, but I don't know, I feel like I can do a better job. Is there anything you've learned about, I don't know, human behavior or how to design software for these sorts of experiences that maybe surprised you or thought was really interesting or that was really important?
Shweta Shrivastava (11:51):
Since you mentioned Tesla, I just want to clarify that it's a different system that we are building, which is for Waymo, we started by solving the problem of fully autonomous driving without a human driver at the wheel from the get-go. It's not a driver assist or aid system which relies on the human driver taking over when there's a complex situation. So I think that expectation is built into that kind of a product and so the human folks who are using that product will also have that mindset that, hey, I should be ready to take over when the situation demands because we've built the system from the get-go to work in a fully autonomous mode without a human driver intervention at the wheel.
(12:38):
We had to integrate this into our design philosophy from the very beginning that this has to feel credible, predictable and the writers have to be able to trust the system. So that has been sort of the core of the design philosophy. And so, what happens is, and I heard this from you as well, which resonated with me and I've heard this from a lot of our writers, that for the first five minutes of the ride it's, wow, is this thing really happening.
(13:10):
But then it starts to feel very natural and as if this is how it was always meant to be. After the first five minutes, this is like uneventful. That's exactly how it's supposed to feel, but it's not a happenstance that it feels that way. The naturalness, the smoothness and still adhering to safety at all times are things that are designed into the system. And then we make sure that the rider has visibility into what's happening. If they're not wearing the seatbelt, the rider support would call them. So then they know, okay, there's a human that they can reach out to if they have an issue. They can look at the monitor in the car to understand what the car is seeing. So I think all these little things help develop that trust in the system.
Lenny (13:57):
On that same note, what's one thing that your teams have built that creates a lot of trust or maybe it was a surprisingly important element in creating trust in the experience in terms of the product, especially in, I don't know, either the app or in car experience.
Shweta Shrivastava (14:14):
I don't know if I can point to one thing. Again, this is such a holistic experience that I think it has to be a bunch of small things to make it feel natural, transparent and trustworthy to the writers. And I can give you one example that I don't think I've mentioned in the discussion so far. So, again, because the system is designed to be cautious and defensive but still making adequate progress in the absence of traffic, it will never go above the speed limit. It doesn't go above the speed limit. It sticks or adheres to the speed limit or something that a lot of our riders actually appreciate about the system.
(14:55):
Now, it turns out that adhering to the speed limit even without traffic sometimes is not the best thing. You have to go below the speed limit and we realize that for driving in the slopes or the gradients, in clients in San Francisco, there are many of those. The human brain is trained to, or the human drivers are sort of in subconsciously, they slow down when they go downhill in those slopes. The autonomous vehicle doesn't necessarily have to do that if it's safe and if it's staying below the speed limit.
(15:31):
But we learned that this is a more natural driving experience and this is what our riders would also expect in terms of the experience. So that's something that we then modify the behavior on.
Lenny (15:45):
That makes sense. I would want it to slow down. On the other hand, if I feel like I could trust that, I wish there was a button to just crazy mode, just go for it. Kind of digging a little bit into the product team's way of working, what are KPIs that you all use to track progress? I don't know, either amongst some of the teams you lead or also just broadly progress on self-driving technology. How do you know you're making progress? Is it just miles driven as something else?
Shweta Shrivastava (16:12):
There are tons of these metrics that we analyze on a daily basis, weekly basis depending upon what the metric is. But if I were to categorize them in two broad categories, that'd be the commercial and operational metrics and the system behavior metrics. So, one important thing to note here is that we're in a proof of concept or a pilot phase anymore. This is the service that we are offering to riders. Paid service in Phoenix and also it's open to public in San Francisco, so it's an actual service.
(16:46):
And so, we're tracking the commercial metrics in terms of the trips per week, the daily or weekly active users and all the funnel metrics that you can think of. Also, the operational metrics, the cost, right? Well, how much is the thing costing us to operate? So that's, I would say, all the stuff on the commercial scaling side. And then on the driver performance, the vehicle driver as the technology name as I alluded to earlier, the driver performance metrics, they span across safety, the compliance to the road rules, our ability to make adequate progress as in not get unduly stopped or stranded in dense traffic situations as an example.
Lenny (17:32):
What are just specific metrics there? Anything you could share just like what is the actual goal in one of those teams?
Shweta Shrivastava (17:38):
The goal here is to be able to drive safer than humans. Now, we don't really have one standard human driving benchmark, safety benchmark, that everybody uses, but we do gather enough of that data. We have access to enough of that data to form an opinion on or a metric on or benchmark on what does human driving look like, how many collisions, as an example, a human driver would have every a hundred thousand mile. And then we want to make sure that our performance is better than that.
(18:19):
So that's simplifying, right? And several things go into both calculating the benchmark as well as our performance against that benchmark. But that at the core of it, that's what we're trying to do. So that's on the safety side and then I would say on the stops and strands, which is trying to, which goes in the different direction. Hey, you can be very safe if you're not moving at all. That's not what we're building. We need to make sure that the riders get to their destination on time. So it has to be appropriately assertive and be making the right progress.
(18:53):
And, so again, how much did the vehicle slow down unduly, right? Or, in how many instances in a given week did it have to rely on a rescue help? Those are the situations that we want to avoid. And then, how much did we slow down the traffic for other users? So we again do extensive benchmarking and look at the priors, et cetera, and really understand would an adequate performance be there and measure our own against that.
Lenny (19:28):
Awesome. Today's episode is brought to you by Elements. I just recently discovered this stuff actually from another podcast and it is such sweet, salty goodness. Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency.
(19:57):
Element is the exclusive hydration partner to team US USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes. Also, dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on Element to stay hydrated along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try Element totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor.
(20:27):
My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.
(20:38):
I'm guessing you're not going to have an answer to when do we think we'll have fully self-driving level five autonomy. So let me ask you a different approach to that question of just what's most in the way of us getting to full self-driving where we don't have to do anything ever? Is it like miles driven? Is it like tech breakthroughs that still have to happen? Is it regulation and just cities being like, okay, it's fine. What's the biggest blocker at this point or bottleneck?
Shweta Shrivastava (21:01):
So let me share my opinion on the L5.
Lenny (21:01):
Cool.
Shweta Shrivastava (21:06):
So L for those who might not be very familiar with this term, L2, L3 is still very much driver assist. It gets to some level of autonomy but then it relies on the human driver at the wheel to be able to take over complex situations. L4 fully autonomous without a human driver at the wheel and no expectation of a human driver at the wheel. That's what we've been focusing on. L5 would be in any kind of road completely unstructured, off-roading in that kind of an environment, be able to drive without any map, without any priors, what have you.
(21:44):
And we believe that by offering the kind of service that we are offering in Phoenix and in San Francisco through the rest of this year and other cities in future is it helps realize that the dream of the fully autonomous driving, in a big way, without having to go to L5. So I think that the technology is already there. L5, I'm not sure, maybe that becomes more niche, et cetera. It solves very specific use cases.
(22:16):
In terms of the blocker, I would say, the technology is there, but it still needs improvements. Especially we were not able to drive in snow yet. Something that we have to tackle in future.
Lenny (22:25):
I could barely drive in slow.
Shweta Shrivastava (22:28):
Yeah. And I don't like to drive in snow. Even I, I avoid snowy days. But that is something that we still have to build as a capability in driving fully in snow now. So that's great.
Lenny (22:39):
Makes sense. Clearly, there's a lot of little things, a lot of big things and it's a really interesting point about we don't need L5, L4 is great for most people. Maybe a last question along this track and then I want to pivot to a different area. So Waymo's been this long-term investment for Alphabet and many PMs often try to create buy-in and keep buy-in for large investment and large project. I know this is a different scale of investment than what most PMs work through. But is there anything you've learned about keeping leaders bought in and excited and continuing to invest in a project for years and years? Specifically just like tactics that keep people excited and bought into a long-term investment?
Shweta Shrivastava (23:21):
Yeah. So first of all, we are fortunate that we have the backing from Alphabet and other investors. And the autonomous vehicle industry is interesting and I think the last year has been interesting with more consolidation happening. So I think the name of the game here is to show progress, show meaningful progress and meaningful progress, not just in terms of technology but in terms of commercial deployments. That is the rubber meets the road, if you will, phase off of the product.
(23:54):
And the results have to speak for themselves, for our investors to have the confidence in us. So notwithstanding what's happening to other AB companies in the industry, it's about what we are doing. And then look at the progress that we've been making and where we are headed. And the fact that we've been accelerating our milestones and going through our own expectations, I think, these are very positive signals to our investors as well.
(24:23):
Another startup as well, t's not about you have to do what's the right thing for the business. Your focus is on creating value for the customers, creating value for the riders. You have to build a business that makes sense and the investors see that too. Or we're not going to do something unnatural or something that doesn't align with the business goals in order to gain any short term brownie points with investors. I think it doesn't work that way and the investors will see through that too.
(24:52):
Definitely Alphabet has been our backer for forever. So, it's really about focusing on building the right business and doing the right thing for the users.
Lenny (25:03):
I think that's a great takeaway that if you're finding that there's a buy-in and continued support for what you're building, focus on momentum and showing success. It's pretty simple if you think about it. And it's hard to cut something that's just showing success. And so, even at the scale of Waymo, it's a great lesson. So that makes sense.
Shweta Shrivastava (25:03):
Absolutely.
Lenny (25:24):
We talked a bit about other companies you've worked at and so I want to kind of zoom out a little bit. And I just want to ask, you worked at Amazon, Cisco, Waymo now, startup you mentioned. What are just some of the biggest lessons you've learned about building successful teams and successful products?
Shweta Shrivastava (25:40):
In terms of the product, whether you're working for a big company or a startup, the core product management tenant is still the same, which is, you have to work backwards from the customer problem or the user problem. Building a technology for the sake of it doesn't really go that far, so you really have to focus on the, what are you building, who are you building it for and what problem are you solving?
(26:05):
And this applies in any context. And Amazon has this great process where the PMs have to write a press release for the finished product even before they start building the product. That's the first thing that they have to do is to write that press release like the product is about to launch today. What are you telling the users about that product? Really forces them to think about the value proposition more thoroughly.
(26:33):
And I know many other companies are starting to look at that practice as well, but I find it very effective.
Lenny (26:39):
Do you do that at Waymo or do you folks do that? Is there kind of a system there or?
Shweta Shrivastava (26:43):
The explicit PR FAQ process that Amazon follows is, I think, Waymo has its own version of it. But it is about sort of focusing on the customer problem. Now, Waymo is also a very different kind of product. It's highly integrated. And different types of product management flavors, if you will. Some are more technically focused and technically deep, some are more commercially focused. So they all adapt. They have their versions of working backwards from the customer problem. But that still remains the core tenant in my mind.
(27:13):
The other big lesson, at least working in some of the large companies that I have had is it's also very important to know what you're not building. And this one is not only in big companies, I would say even in startups, it's extremely important to know what you're not building because you could very easily get swayed by customer X telling you to do this, customer y telling you to do that. And a product that tries to be all things to all people usually doesn't end up going anywhere.
(27:42):
So that focus, that prioritization and being crisp about what you're building and what you're not building is very important. And then, in the context of the large companies, what I was going to say was, I think, is the classic innovator's dilemma. The large companies tend to be the market share leaders in their focus areas. And so, the product team and the product leaders can get very incremental in their product strategy and then lo and behold, you see an upstart that comes and disrupts them.
(28:16):
And so, I have definitely learned the lesson that you need to disrupt yourself before somebody else does because it's going to happen. It's inevitable. And large companies that are constantly challenging themselves and disrupting their own models or their own product capabilities to bring those, even something more transformational for the customers, are the ones that really succeed. And I think this is where the product leaders have to bring in that mindset of, hey, are we getting too complacent or it's time to just.
Lenny (28:46):
That's such a good reminder. Is there an example of you doing that or something you worked on where you got the company to commit to something that maybe could have been a threat from a disruptor or maybe even just seen that happening at a company? Just like is there a specific project or investment that comes to mind?
Shweta Shrivastava (29:02):
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]At Amazon, I was the first PM and then I drove the team around it for a no-code application development platform called Honey Code. So that was a brand new service. Amazon had never delved in that space before. It was more infrastructure focused and this was first of its kind service that the team worked on. And this has played out many times in my career, and so I am a big believer in disrupting yourself before somebody else does it.
Lenny (29:33):
What do you think is the most underrated PM skill that you suggest people, maybe especially early in their career, that they should focus on maybe that they're probably not thinking about?
Shweta Shrivastava (29:42):
I think the listening and empathy are the top ones. These are very important because I think when folks think about product management, they think about the influencing without authority and prioritization and being able to write with PR, et cetera, all those things are sort of more top of mind. The listening and empathy, I wouldn't say that they are underrated, I think is there's now a lot more recognition that these are sort of core skills if you want to be able to influence a lot without authority.
But I think it's easier said than done. You really have to come in with that growth mindset, with that beginner's mindset, be able to absorb and just learn and listen and don't jump in with ideas necessarily, right? Take the time to formulate that opinion to really learn and understand the customer and the market and really be true to that tenant of working backwards from the customer problem, not just say because it's become such a platitude now in the product world.
Lenny (30:42):
Yeah, there's a book. There's a whole book called Working Backwards now.
Shweta Shrivastava (30:46):
Yes. That is the one thing that I would say that somebody who's starting out as a product manager really try to follow that principle. And then listening and empathy is going to go a long way in terms of being able to do that.
Lenny (31:00):
On listening and empathy, what do you think helped you most develop those two skills?
Shweta Shrivastava (31:06):
So I think for me, part of it was just doing this over and over again in different environments, in different product launches that I have led in different types of companies that I've worked with. In startup as well as big company, the dynamic is different. And, again, the team that you're working with in different companies have a different culture. So, when you're working with let's say an engineering leader, being able to understand what are his or her constraints? Where is he or she coming from? What does impact look like to that person? And then understanding where you're aligned, where you're not aligned are things that you have to develop and start paying a lot more attention to as you rise in your career or go up the ladder.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And I think a lot of that for me came by just being in different kind of situations and different kind of environments.
Lenny (32:08):
Yeah. That's what I often say also, a lot of this just comes from doing it again and again and again. There's not going to take a course and then just I'm a great listener, I'm done.
Shweta Shrivastava (32:18):
Yeah, no, it doesn't.
Lenny (32:19)
Yeah, which is not easy to ... It'd be nice if there's a book you read and then you become a great listener and a great empathizer.
Shweta Shrivastava (32:24):
Well, I think one take or one that I could share is just challenging your own assumptions. So, I think listening with an open mind but then are you proactively trying to challenge your own assumptions is extremely important. As a big enough product manager as well as a seasoned product leader, if you're not doing enough of that, then I think you might not be listening well, right? Or you might not be picking on the cues. If there's no conflict, if there's no contention, then something is missing.
Lenny (33:03):
It's not often you're going to be always right.
Shweta Shrivastava (33:04):
Yeah.
Lenny (33:05):
Maybe one more question along these lines. You've been promoted many times, now you're in a place where you promote people and I'm curious for someone that maybe wants to get promoted or struggling to get promoted, what would you say are probably the reasons they aren't? Or what do you think people should focus on if they want to just get a promotion and many promotions in their career?
Shweta Shrivastava (33:28):
I'm going to say something that might sound a little cheeky, but I think the way to get promoted is to not want it too badly. It is about you have to focus on the impact. It's about having an impact and then doing what is right for the business. So not sort of optimizing things for your promotion, which look, we are all ambitious human beings. And there's nothing wrong with wanting a promotion, just to be clear, and there's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but then focus on the impact.
(34:03):
Are you working on the right things that will have the right outcome for the business? Because if you are and if you are giving it to your 100%, that will be visible. And making your ambitions known to your manager, to your leader, is a good thing that you should. And so, when the right opportunity comes, at least your leader or manager is aware that, hey, this person wanted to work on something more challenging, so maybe I put her on that project.

But you have to be focused on really creating the right impact for the company and not optimizing for yourself to get promoted. If you try to maneuver that too much, it becomes visible and it's not a positive signal to the organization when they can see that that's what you're trying to do. And it also distracts you from the things that you need to be focusing on. So, I would say, improve your skillset as a product manager. Make sure that you're made your vision known that you want to work on challenging high visibility projects or products that really test or stretch your skills and then be really dedicated to that cause and work on what has the business impact for the company, do the right things.
Lenny (35:15):
I really like that advice. I 100% agree with all of that. I have a couple final Waymo questions and then we're going to get to our very exciting lightning round. Just for folks that maybe want to try out Waymo, so maybe just like where's it live now? When do you think it'll roll out to new cities? And then, how do people try it and use it if they live in one of those cities? If that's possible.
Shweta Shrivastava (35:37):
We are already in the Phoenix metro area and in San Francisco. So in those cities you can just go and download the app and you can use the service. We have done initial fully autonomous testing in LA. And we're going to be expanding in LA through the rest of the year, so stay tuned for more development on that front. And then, we do have a list of cities that we're going to be rolling out in the coming years, but unfortunately, I can't share that list just as yet.
Lenny (36:04):
And if someone lives in one of those cities, is there a way they could try to get on a wait list or try to use this stuff or is it closed doors right now?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:11):
So it is open doors in San Francisco and Phoenix.
Lenny (36:15):
Got it. So you just sign up and you get on the waitlist and then you might get off?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:17):
In Phoenix, I don't even think that there is a wait list.
Lenny (36:20):
Oh wow.
Shweta Shrivastava (36:21):
On the waitlist.
Lenny (36:22):
I got to move to Phoenix. That's cool.
Shweta Shrivastava (36:24):
Or just wait, just yeah, a little while in San Francisco. But yeah, Phoenix is great. So, if you want to move there, that's totally fine.
Lenny (36:33):
No, I'm going to start packing tonight. Just joking. Anything else you want to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:40):
No, I think we talked about a bunch of things. It's been a great conversation so far.
Lenny (36:45):
It's not over yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I have six questions for you. Are you ready?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:51):
Bring it on.
Lenny (36:52):
Okay, here we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Shweta Shrivastava (36:58):
Crossing The Chasm by Geoffrey Moore and Clayton Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma are still sort of the two classics in product management that I have quoted a lot and I have recommended to many folks.
Lenny (37:12):
Awesome. I've got both in my little bookshelf behind me.
Shweta Shrivastava (37:14):
Yeah, me too.
Lenny (37:15):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
Shweta Shrivastava (37:19):
I have an eight-year-old daughter, so my viewing choices are very much influenced by what she watches. But let's see, I did enjoy the Top Gun, the new Top Gun movie, Top Gun Maverick quite a bit. We watched it in the theater and visuals were just fantastic. I think it was also inspiring to see what Tom Cruise was able to do and it's quite a feat that he pulled off at this age. It was very inspirational.
Lenny (37:49):
Fully agree. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people?
Shweta Shrivastava (37:53):
Especially at the senior levels, I always ask them, when was one time that you failed and what did you learn from it? I've seen that folks who has either say that they've never failed or they're trying a success story as a failure story are usually, they're disingenuous or have not had the depth of experience. So I ask that question and I'm looking for some real solid examples there.
Lenny (38:21):
Awesome. What's a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?
Shweta Shrivastava (38:27):
I wouldn't say that I recently discovered it. It's on my wishlist to buy very soon. I'm all for sustainable mobility, so I am shopping for a foldable ebike so I can do more mountain biking without doing mountain biking. That's the sustainable part for me, I guess.
Lenny (38:47):
Is there a specific model or brand that you are most excited about?
Shweta Shrivastava (38:50):
I would take recommendations from you, but I'm still shopping. I think electric, there are a couple.
Lenny (38:57):
All right. Folks who have recommendations, leave suggestions in the comments.
Shweta Shrivastava (39:01):
Please do.
Lenny (39:01):
And what's something relatively minor you've changed in your team's product development process that you've found has had a tremendous impact?
Shweta Shrivastava (39:09):
I wouldn't say that this is a product development process, although, in different parts of phase of my career, I have definitely instituted different types of processes and tools that have helped improve the product development. But I would give you an interesting one that I use a lot in my prior company and then I use a different form of it here in Waymo is what I used to call as the rule of seven. If there have been seven emails in an email thread and you still haven't resolved the issue, just call the person or get in a room huddle, resolve it live.
(39:43):
But the long email exchanges that don't converge and go anywhere I feel are a waste of time for many people. So I'm like, you've got to a limit. Waymo is a bigger company, so the limit's more like 10, but if you haven't resolved something within an X number of emails, please just get on a call, get in a room and get it resolved.
Lenny (40:04):
I love that. And the idea is it's seven if it's like you and that person going back and forth seven times?
Shweta Shrivastava (40:09):
Yeah. Or all of people are just going back and forth. And then adding more people and then everybody chime in, but where is this thing really headed?
Lenny (40:21):
I love that. Final question. If anyone gets to ride in a Waymo, what's a pro tip for them to have an awesome experience?
Shweta Shrivastava (40:29):
Bring your favorite playlist, sit back and enjoy the ride.
Lenny (40:33):
Great. When I was on my right, I turned on some jazz and it was raining outside. It was real cozy.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:39):
But did you actually do it on the ... So, so there's a feature, if you have a Google, you have to download the Google Assistant, but you can actually play your playlist list in the car.
Lenny (40:49):
That's cool. No, I chose a station that was in there just like jazz music.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:52):
Okay. Yeah.
Lenny (40:39):
Yeah. Okay. This is great. All right. Hopefully I get another ride someday.
Shweta Shrivastava (40:56):
Yes, you should.
Lenny (40:57):
Shweta, this was amazing. I am going to start packing my bags for Phoenix. I'm going to sell my car. Everything's going to change
Shweta Shrivastava (41:04):
Exactly what we wish for.
Lenny (41:07):
There's your KPI. Thank you again for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask you maybe some questions, maybe apply to join Waymo if you're hiring, and how can listeners be useful to you?
Shweta Shrivastava (41:20):
You can find me on LinkedIn. And then if you are interested in opportunities at Waymo, go to Waymo career web page. You should see all the open positions. It's okay for you to reach out to me on LinkedIn as well for product management roles. How can listeners be useful to me? I would say, hey, sign up for the ride in Phoenix or San Francisco and LA when we open up, give us feedback.
Lenny (41:43):
Awesome. Shweta, thank you again for being here.
Shweta Shrivastava (41:47):
Thank you. It was great to have this conversation.

## Transcript

Sriram Krishnan (00:00:00):
I hate Jobs-to-be-Done, I think it is a terrible framework, I think no successful company has ever been built on top of JTBD and if you pick JTBD, you're probably doomed and I'll give you an example. When you sign up for Instagram right now, when you sign up for Facebook for many, many years, Facebook knew that it needed to get you to 10 friends in 14 days. If you got your 10 friends in 14 days, you were probably going to use Facebook. So it'd be like, "Well, we're going to throw every tool we have at our disposal to get you to 10 friends and 14 days."

(00:00:23):
So if you signed up for Facebook for many, many years, you'll get this little thing called People You May Know. Then you'll have this person who just signed up for Facebook, you go, "Why I'm seeing this person?" It's not because you need a friend, because they need a friend. So what Facebook did was it made your experience slightly worse to make that person's experience slightly better. This was performing no job for you, it was trying to perform a job for them.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hardware and experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today for the first time ever, I've got two guests, Aarthi Ramamurthy and Sriram Krishnan, both former product managers who between them worked at basically every major tech company including Netflix, Meta, Snap, Twitter, Microsoft, even Clubhouse. Sriram is now a partner at a16z. They're actually married and both individually amazing. Together they host the Aarthi and Sriram Good Time Show, which started on Clubhouse, it's now on YouTube and famously they had Elon Musk on back in the day, which led to Clubhouse's crazy rocket ship growth, which we definitely touch on.

(00:01:32):
This episode is definitely the most fun conversation I have had yet on this podcast. We cover all kinds of areas, including this trend of techno optimism, building your network, creating content online and how to go about doing that, becoming a product leader, community building and a hilarious rant at the end about why the Jobs-to-be-Done framework does not work. I had such a good time chatting with these two and I know you'll enjoy this episode. With that, I bring you Aarthi and Sriram after a short word from our select sponsors.

(00:02:02):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.

(00:02:37):
If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table beginning. Getting a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:04:18):
Aarthi and Sriram, welcome to the podcast.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:04:20):
Thank you. Thanks so much for having us, Lenny. This is a bucket list thing because we are on Lenny's Podcast.

Sriram Krishnan (00:04:27):
I know. Longtime subscriber, listener and now here. Wow. I don't want to screw this up.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:04:36):
First time caller.

Sriram Krishnan (00:04:37):
Yeah, first time caller. Yeah, let's not screw this up.

Lenny (00:04:39):
You guys are hilarious. I appreciate it and feel very flattered. You two are the first duo on this podcast and I couldn't think of a better two people to start this podcast with. I have so much stuff I want to dig into. I think we're going to have a lot of fun, so again, thanks for joining me here.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:04:54):
It's awesome. Big fan. Yeah, honestly, this just... I'm excited.

Lenny (00:05:00):
So I don't know if you remember this, I was thinking about this story, back when you were doing the Good Time Show, you invited me on the Good Time Show and I was thinking, hesitating, like, "I don't know, that's kind of scary." And then the next day, Elon came on and then it just blew up and I was like, "Shit, I missed my chance." And then became really fancy people and I was like, "I'm not ever going to make it back on there." And so I look back at that as like, "Oh, I hesitated too long. That's a lesson."

Sriram Krishnan (00:05:22):
Well, the way you should interpret that is, "They couldn't get me on, so their backup choice was Elon. I would've been the main event and they were like, 'Well, oh, we couldn't get Lenny, we'll get... No, but seriously, we've been a huge fan and those are just the fun times. We used to do the show obviously on just Clubhouse and now we do the show on YouTube, wherever you can listen to our podcast. And a lot of people remember us for the Elon episode, but I will tell you this, it is often the folks who were working technology, who were not as famous, you're obviously very famous now, but who really connected with the audience. But you know what, that's why we have you back on the show now [inaudible 00:06:02].

Lenny (00:05:22):
There we go. It all worked out.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:06:01):
Opening act, yeah.

Lenny (00:06:07):
Speaking of Elon, I was always curious, how did you actually get him on the show? I remember that was back before he was very vocal in the world and he was hard to learn from and hear from. How did you actually pull that off?

Sriram Krishnan (00:06:18):
Well, I think it's actually similar to how a lot of good things in my career have happened, which is I just had a conversation on the internet. I have this whole thing where I do think a lot of people trying to get ahead in their career, especially in technology, should just write cold emails, cold DMs, notes, put out content, et cetera and that leads to good things.

(00:06:39):
In Elon's case actually, what wound up happening was a few years ago, he DMed me out of the blue. At the time, I was working at Twitter and I think he saw something I'd written and wanted something from the company and I think he went through the org chart and he DMed me. And I was like, "Well, I'd love to help you," and he sent me his phone number. And I called him and I was like, "Is this [inaudible 00:07:00] and we had a conversation and we built up a relationship after that. This was when Clubhouse first came on the scene and I was like, "Well, who do we get on?" and Elon hadn't done a lot of press appearances, I think he's done a lot more since then obviously, and I texted him and he was like, "I'm game," and the rest is history.

Lenny (00:07:20):
Amazing. I love that Elon just DMed you. Sriram-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:07:25):
Slid into his DMs [inaudible 00:07:25].

Sriram Krishnan (00:07:26):
The crazy part of that story was I had texted him saying, "You should come on the show," and he said, "Sure," and then he tweeted about it. And I will tell you that when Elon tweets about you and well, even maybe more so now, your phone just melts. And then for the entire afternoon, I had hundred thousands of people asking me what's going to happen, the Clubhouse people-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:07:46):
But also on Clubhouse, if you open the Clubhouse app that day, there were so many rooms that were trying to collect questions for us and help us prepare. There was so much pressure just scrolling through the hallway and trying to look through, it's like, "Oh my God, is this real? We are the people that they're talking about here. This is crazy." I don't know if you've listened to the actual thing, but it was pretty cool because we got to ask him questions we've always wanted to ask on like, "When do we get to Mars?" it was kind of fun. And then after that, again it was this, we got a bunch of people reaching out and being like, "You should have asked this question. You guys are not professional journalists." And we are like, "No, we're not. What gave it away?" We are just random two people who are just talking to this guy, so it was really fun.

Lenny (00:08:33):
Yeah, I remember that. I remember journalists were like, "They're not actually asking him hard questions. How dare they have him on, give him a platform to share things without any criticism?"

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:08:39):
And we were like, "We are not those people that you think we are, that's just never been our job."

Lenny (00:08:46):
Yeah. I have so many questions that spiral from this discussion, but I want to ask one quick Clubhouse question. So Aarthi, you worked at Clubhouse for a while. Very tactically, I feel like they're really smart initially with their growth strategy of just getting fancy, smart people in there talking and pontificating. They had Naval and Marc Andreessen and then eventually, you want other people. And that was such a smart way to get people to get in there and want to get in there to listen to them, to engage with them. What's your take on that as just a growth strategy to get a social network bootstrapped? And then just generally, I guess any thoughts on the journey of Clubhouse? It's had a big rise, it's kind of [inaudible 00:09:22].

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:09:21):
Yeah. I mean, all good questions here. I think growth strategy, that's a great way to acquire people right at the top of the funnel. Once you've done this a few times, you kind of see everything as a funnel and you're like, "Well, are you retaining people? Are you not? Is it top of the funnel impressions or do they stick around?" So I think having people like Marc Andreessen and people like Naval and they were not doing this out of any... they were really, really interested. When we got invited by Marc and Marc was like, "Check out... this was way before a16z even invested in it, was like, "This product is amazing. These folks are doing something really cool, this is going to be the future, it's amazing." So it gave them a platform to go speak out and live social audio just made a ton of sense. I will say, Clubhouse, I feel like they get this unfair attention and criticism. It's a what, three-year-old startup?

Lenny (00:10:17):
Mm-hmm.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:10:18):
And I've done two startups. The second one I did, three years in, we still sort of were struggling and trying to figure out what we were doing. So I mean, I feel like founders just need some time to breathe in and figure out what to go do. So I'm bullish on Clubhouse, I think they'll figure it out and Paul and Rohan are great founders. They've been doing social stuff for over a decade plus and so they've got to figure it out. And I know that it's like, they get this thing on, "Oh, they were really hot during the pandemic. Is this a pandemic fad versus not?" I don't know, it's a product at the end of the day and you're going to have to find product market fit and I think they'll figure it out.

Sriram Krishnan (00:10:56):
Yeah. The broader question of how do social products acquire the users is super interesting. One of my favorite pieces written on this is Eugene Wei's Status as a Service. Eugene should absolutely be on your podcast someday. It's a 10,000 word piece, which is amazing and highly suggest people read it. But one of the key takeaways from that piece is the idea that when you have a new network, think of it as a new country, you want the high status people and high status mean they're interesting, people want to be where they are in some shape or form because they have money, they're smart, they're cool, they're good-looking, whatever it may be and you want to get them onto your network. And there's exactly an interesting corollary that they're often underserved by other existing platforms. And because if they're already well-served, they wouldn't want to move to you.

(00:11:43):
And Eugene doesn't talk about it, but if I look at say the history of all the three, four large social media companies, you've seen this pattern. For example, they've often each had a breakout set of stars who are unique to the platform. For example, if you look at say Snapchat, you had folks like Kylie Jenner who really broke out first. If you look at Instagram, I would think The Rock, Cristiano Ronaldo, a lot of others are organic to Instagram. But let's say you get to TikTok. One of the things you'll see is a lot of the folks from the Instagram world rarely move to TikTok and there's a couple of reasons. One, they didn't really need to because they were already popular on some of these other existing platforms, but two, TikTok actually took advantage of a different set of skillsets. People who are really good on video, people who could dance, be funny. And so you saw the rise of Charli D'Amelio and Addison and so many others who are different.

(00:12:31):
So every single time, I think you need to go after a set of people who are high status who are also underserved. So coming back to Clubhouse, I think one of the interesting things is I think these celebrities are super interesting, but what is more interesting for me is all the homegrown folks. I actually consider us as a part of that, we would not be here doing the show if it wasn't for Clubhouse. There are many folks who had that original launch using the platform, so I think for folks here who are thinking about social platforms, it's interesting about okay, you need interesting people from elsewhere, but you also need homegrown talent. And by the way, you are a perfect example of this phenomenon because you are Substack's homegrown talent and I think you bring a lot of value to Substack. And there are a lot of people with huge newsletters, et cetera, but I think your rise and your popularity is so tied to Substack now and that's actually a great example of all of this.

Lenny (00:13:25):
Yeah. It reminds me, the founder of Musical.ly who turned into TikTok has a great story. I think you've heard his talk about this, how the way he thought about it is there's all these successful people on Instagram, that's Europe, and the people you can convince to come to America are not the kings of Europe, but they're the peasants that are like, "Oh, we have a new opportunity to rise and become a king or a queen." And so those are the people you pull in, the people not doing well on another platform that want to do well versus the people already killing it.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:13:53):
Yeah, [inaudible 00:13:53].

Sriram Krishnan (00:13:53):
Lenny just called himself the king of Substack right there.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:13:55):
Yes, I know. You're the king, you're the king of Americas.

Sriram Krishnan (00:13:58):
I'm just trying to give you clippable moments on video.

Lenny (00:14:00):
I did just find out that I think I have the fourth-largest Substack newsletter on all of Substack which is ridiculous-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:05):
That's amazing, wow. That's amazing.

Lenny (00:14:05):
Their recent number.

Sriram Krishnan (00:14:08):
Yeah. Number three, number two, number one, Lenny is coming after you, better watch out.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:08):
Take them out.

Lenny (00:14:12):
Yeah. They're up there. So you mentioned the chat with Elon and how you're very tech positive and I think that's something that you two are at the forefront of, is this trend, I don't know if it's called techno-optimism or maybe there's another term for it and I'd love to hear just like why? Because I know that's important to you too, why that's important to you and just what is this movement of techno-optimism-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:32):
Let me take a small stab at it. Look, I think it's also very personal to our context and our upbringing. For us, Sriram and I came from a fairly middle class family in India, this city in India that most people here won't probably know. And we grew up really liking computers but didn't have access to a computer for a longest time. In both our cases, our parents bought us our first computers after saving money for it and it was a hard thing. And when we eventually got onto it and started learning to write code, we met each other online. We're dating ourselves now, but we met on Yahoo Messenger back in the day and we worked on this nerdy coding project, that's how we connected. So technology and computers have given us everything.

(00:15:19):
Our first jobs were at Microsoft, we built developer tools and platforms. If you were in our shoes, you would feel the same way too. Tech has given us so much. And so for us to come here all the way from India, through multiple cities, we lived in Seattle and then here, the Bay Area, I've started tech companies, it is a bit frustrating to see the other viewpoint because you can see how much it has uplifted people, careers, lives, but also just from what we've been able to work on, what we've seen our friends work on and ship and put out there, it has dramatically moved the needle. And so for us, we are the living testament of tech actually helping us and help us do better, so I don't even see the other viewpoint from like, why wouldn't you be optimistic about technology? I don't get it.

Sriram Krishnan (00:16:10):
Yeah. I think the personal part was really core. I think there's generally two schools of thought. One school of thought, I would broadly write up as things are getting worse, technology is making things worse and we should all do less, build less. And then the other school of thought, which I think I subscribe to, is technology is not perfect, the impact technology is definitely uneven, but pretty much most of the good things in the world over the last 100, 200 years are responsible for it. And we can have a whole long discussion about the evidence why and we have lots of very fancy sounding intellectual theories as to why, but at the heart of it is what Aarthi said, if it wasn't for tech, we wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be doing this.

(00:16:45):
I suspect a lot of folks who are listening to this wouldn't be able to listen to it, wouldn't have the opportunities they have or have the opportunities we have. It is a great level up. My dad pretty much had the same job for his entire life, essentially from age 25 till the time he retired and there was really no easy path out for him. And I imagine like, "Hey, if he was born 40 years later and he had a laptop and an internet connection and could get on GitHub, here are opportunities that would be just impossible, even 30, 40 years ago and that's all from technology." So I think that's at the heart of it, it's the best thing we have of getting ahead.

Lenny (00:17:21):
It's such a refreshing perspective on tech. In traditional media, all you ever hear about is all the problems that tech is causing and all the dangers and how we're all screwed. And so it's like you almost forget that there could be really positive stories about what's happening with tech and it feels like there's a small number of people that are doing this at scale and-

Sriram Krishnan (00:17:40):
Oh, yeah. I'll give you one small example. You made a joke about kings from Europe, et cetera. If we just go back 100 years, the piece of hardware that a king or a royalty would use or a rich person would use would be so different from what a peasant would use, but you know what? I suspect the phone that you and I have is probably the same phone that... actually I know it's the same phone that Elon Musk uses, the richest person in the world. I know a lot of folks in India who have very high end Android device, they have access to the same internet. You go to google.com, google.com doesn't know your net worth, it gives you the same results. Chat GPT doesn't know how rich you are. It may not like you, but it doesn't know how rich you are. If you just think of all these constructs, they're were just impossible technology. But anyway, that's a whole other conversation.

Lenny (00:18:24):
Yeah, I love that the richest people have the same phone as me and nothing they can do about it. Something else you two are really good at is building a network, building community, building personal brands. I know a lot of people listening are either often told, "You need to build a audience online, you build a brand, you got to build a network," and all these things. So I guess I'd love to know just what advice do you give people that come to you and like, "Hey, I want to build a personal brand, I want to build the network"? Just how to go about doing that, what's worked well for you two?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:18:54):
Sriram has way more structured thoughts on this and honestly, he's way better at this than I've ever been. He's basically slowly corrupted me and brought me to the dark side. But what I have come to believe and this differs from what I used to believe is especially if you're working in a big company, you are one of the many thousands of employees in there. Generally what you get told is, "Hey, just ship really good products, put your head down, go to work. The products will speak for themselves. That's just how it's going to work. Don't do this whole personal branding and all of that stuff. It's such a distraction," and that's generally what you're told.

(00:19:34):
Most of my career I was like, "Yeah, of course that makes sense, that's kind of what you do." But I've come to realize that that is just not true and this might be a controversial opinion, but you have to get out there and build your own brand. You have to figure out what you stand for, what your core values are, what you believe in, what you think you want to do, what your next career trajectory is going to look like. All of that is just up to you. It's not up to the company to figure it out for you, it's not up to anybody else, it's just up to you.

(00:20:05):
And I think building a personal brand is looked down upon so much that people think of it as a dirty word. It's like, "No, you can't do that." "Oh, look at this person who's branding themselves," kind of thing. But I almost see it as what distinguishes you from everybody else and that is not so much saying something that you're not good at or touting yourself more, it's really about highlighting, "I'm really good at this thing and I want to talk about this thing and I want to do videos about it or write about it or tweet about it." Whatever is your forum, you have to put yourself out there.

Sriram Krishnan (00:20:43):
I mean this is probably one of the most important things that somebody can do and I spent... no, we spent years slowly climbing the corporate ranks. We were junior product managers, IC product managers, senior product managers, slowly climbed the ranks and ran teams, et cetera. And I spent years just thinking that all I need to do is put my head down, do my job really well and that was it. But then I looked around and I suspect a lot of listeners here probably have the same feeling that some sort of people were getting way more opportunities, some sort of people are way farther ahead even though I was mostly sure that somebody else was doing a better job and I was trying to understand why. And I think building a network, which I'll try and define because I think a lot of people have assumption of what it is, is at the heart of this. So building a network is very simply having relationships with human beings. And let's start off by saying first of all, these have to be authentic, genuine relationships.

(00:21:29):
One thing, it drives me crazy when somebody will come and say, "I'm here to network." I'm like, "I don't know what that word means." So all you're trying to do is have authentic, genuine relationship with people and expecting nothing in return, so that's great. And then people are like, "Oh, well that's awesome, but I'm a senior... for example, I was a senior PM at Microsoft for a bunch of time and then kind of similar at Facebook for a bunch of time, you're like, "Well, what does it mean? I'm here, I'm going to my meetings, I'm doing my day, its only so many hours." I'll be like, "Well, let's start off with go and meet every single peer that you have you don't directly meet with. Go get coffee with them and ask them, 'Hey.' Have no agenda. Just ask them what's going on in their life, who are they, what their life story is and then who are a couple of interesting people that you should meet with? Go talk to your manager and go talk to their peers."

(00:22:14):
Super important, by the way, your manager, peer relations are super important. Go have a coffee with them and they'd be like, "Great, I'm love to meet this person." Then when I joined at Facebook, I was notorious for being the person who sent a cold email to every single Facebook leader. And I'd be like, "Hey, I'm new here, I want to meet. Let's grab coffee," and everybody will say as everyone is a new person and always asking the same thing, which I'll be like, I show up, I'll tell them my story, I'll ask for their story. I'll be like, "What are you folks focused on? How can I help?" Again, no expectation of anything in return. And then I'll be like, "Who else should I talk to?"

(00:22:42):
You do this, you do two coffees a week and literally just ask me two hours a week, everyone has two hours a week, it'll start compounding over overtime and time. And then as the years go by, you keep in touch with the people you used to work with you, these folks will go to other places, five years, six years go by, you start in your mid-20s or late 20s and you know hundreds of people all over. And the important thing about this is that it is a resource in so many different places. For example, one, if you ever need help, you're trying to look for a new role or you're trying to be like, "Hey, I want to hire this person, who knows something about this person?" or, "I want a new role. Who's looking for something?" that network becomes your key resource.

(00:23:21):
Now what I think a lot of people don't do, it's just simple things. Number one is often people just have a great meeting with a peer and then they will never ever follow up. I'm sure a lot of us have the amazing first introduction email they never followed up, don't do that. I try and make it a point to make sure I always meet them once a year, once every six months. I'll just leave a note, "Hey, what's up?" And the other key part is expecting nothing in return. And generally people are very good at reading other people and if you go and being like, "Hey, I just want to meet you because I want a job or I'm here to network," whatever that means, they don't want to meet you. Just go and be very curious about who they are and try and help them. And you'll be surprised wherever you start, within a year, two years, you'll know hundreds of people who you can tap into, so I think that is super powerful. That's just building relationships.

(00:24:05):
The other part is brand building. Both Aarthi and I at different points in our career have gotten feedback in our job saying, "Oh, with Sriram and Aarthi, it's brand build too much, et cetera." I have learned that that is terrible feedback and to totally ignore that and if anybody hears anything like that, just totally ignore that. The things that work well for me and a lot of others is putting yourself out there and that can be anything. That can be like you make a presentation internally, you write tweets, you're prolific on GitHub, you make a YouTube video, it doesn't really matter, but put yourself out there because the internet rewards people being out there. And what happens when you put yourself out there? It's a Bat-Signal. It's telling people that, "Hey, I'm here, this is my body of work," and you know what the internet does? It'll send amazing people to you.

(00:24:45):
You'd be amazed how often somebody just have a random great Twitter thread with no followers and somebody super interesting will email them and that leads to amazing things happening, it encourages serendipity. So over the years, I wish I had listened less to people who said I should not do this and listened more to the people who said I should do this more.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:25:02):
I also think, Sriram keeps saying, "Expect nothing in return," I think the other way I see it is this is again an extension of optimism for us. Generally, we think people like to help each other out, that is just in their true nature. It's not meant to be transactional, it's not meant to be, "If I know them, they will somehow do something for me down the road," it's not that. Just the way we are all building communities and are a part of this broader community, the way we work is we all want to help each other and help them be successful. And if that is in your nature, it's hard to not feel like, "Yeah, of course I want to reach out to them. I want to see what I can do to help them. Maybe something good will happen, we'll collaborate on a project together," whatever. The core tenant being don't expect stuff in return, don't do it on a transactional basis, I think is really important.

Lenny (00:25:53):
What this reminds me of is Naval has this tweet that proved to be so true, which is don't network, instead create amazing things, create value, do good work and then people will want to network with you. And that's really stuck with me and it saves you from going to network events. Instead just go work hard, do awesome stuff and people are going to want to meet you.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:26:12):
I mean you will not believe the number of times I've shown up to some meetup or some founder thing or something and then somebody would come up and be like, "I'm here to network, what's your name?" And I'm like, "What? No, you can't do that. Not how that works."

Sriram Krishnan (00:26:26):
I actually say I disagree with Naval on this because often, when you're part of a large organization, it's really hard to do great work and get recognized for it. You're part of a team, which is great, but it's not the same as saying having a newsletter by yourself or having a piece of content by yourself. So when I was younger, I'd be like, "Great, I'm part of a large part-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:26:48):
I don't know, I mean you guys are saying the same thing, he's just saying create value and put it out there. I don't think it's-

Sriram Krishnan (00:26:53):
Yeah, I think the putting it out there part is super interesting. And also I would just say, don't wait to create amazing things. Often just the act of putting yourself out there can just spur amazing things in itself.

Lenny (00:27:05):
Yeah. And I think especially early in your career, you're not going to create amazing things immediately, so there's a lot of value to reaching out and meeting people. There's a couple of directions I want to go here. One is, so you gave this, I don't know, just mini masterclass on building a network and networking and things like that. I think what'll get people to rewind and listen to that again is I don't think people realize just how connected you two are. You're at the center of so many micro communities of the most incredible people. I don't know if you talk about this, but you run all these micro communities of incredible people in, I don't know, creator land and investors and product people and all these people and so it actually has worked. You may be the most networked person there is and I don't know if people know that.

Sriram Krishnan (00:27:47):
Oh, wow. Is that a good thing? I don't know. Is that-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:27:47):
It's a good thing.

Sriram Krishnan (00:27:51):
It's a good thing. Okay, I like that, I'll go with that.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:27:53):
I think the thing that, well at least with Sriram, outside of all of the masterclass stuff which I think he's particularly good at, I think the thing that Sriram, people don't realize about him is he's just inherently incredibly curious about people. He's just really just wants to know what somebody else does, who they are, what their story is. And this is not some like, "Oh, I'm going to spend 10 minutes letting them talk, I'm going to spend... he often never lets the other person talk, but when he does, he's truly-

Sriram Krishnan (00:27:53):
Hold on a second right there.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:28:26):
... but he is truly curious about who they are, what their story is. By now, we've known each other for 20-ish years and this is every dinner, every event, this is just how he's wired and so you just can't fake that in building out a network. He builds a network by just wanting to know who these people are.

Sriram Krishnan (00:28:49):
Thank you.

Lenny (00:28:50):
That's beautiful.

Sriram Krishnan (00:28:51):
The woman I married, ladies and gentlemen, right there. You marry the right person, everything else becomes [inaudible 00:28:56]. I haven't really talked about this before and I'll keep some of this slightly hidden, but I think the heart of it is I'm just curious about people, I'm just dumb about a lot of things. And I don't mean it as this false modesty way, I know a lot of folks are smarter than me. Lenny obviously is so much smarter than me at writing a Substack newsletter, it's just evident, Andrew Huberman is great at... Brian Armstrong great at building a crypto company, all these folks just evident. But what I realized is a lot of folks sometimes just want to be with other amazing peers. And one sort of hack I built over the years, I was like, "All right, let me just bring interesting people together."

(00:29:34):
So I bring them in, let's just say various kinds of online communities, they're probably over 100 at this point. And I say, "Okay. You trust me, you trust me and I make the rules." Everyone keeps some level of confidence, everyone is a peer, they're all accomplished in their own way, no one is rude or mean or goes off the rails. So I'm a party host, so I'm like, "Okay listen, nobody is going to get super crazy over here," but I'm also curating. I'm like, "Well, I need somebody super thoughtful, I need somebody who's a little controversial, I need somebody who's funny, I need somebody who's like the celebrity... I'm trying to put together, engineer the right vibe or the right atmosphere, but digitally, I'm very anti-social in person. And some of these just happen over time. You put together the group of people and they hang out online and over times, you have a very famous CEO becoming best friends with somebody in their early 20s who's just getting started just because they're in the same space together.

(00:30:35):
So I love creating those online spaces and I think it's something anybody here listening can do. Just take some of your favorite people, stick them in a WhatsApp group or a Telegram group or a Slack channel... which is by the way, Lenny's Slack, highly, highly recommend it. Lenny is great at that. But yours has hundreds of thousands of people and I think sometimes there's an intimacy from having smaller groups, like 5 people, 10 people like a shared space and then kick it off. And you'll be amazed of after a year or two, of how much intimacy and how much connection where sometimes people open up about losing their jobs or having a divorce or something really personal and intense just because of the shared trust. And I think there's something very heartwarming and fulfilling about being able to facilitate some of that.

Lenny (00:31:22):
I want to dig into that a little bit more. You've built these incredible communities and you talked about a couple, and Aarthi, I know you also built Facebook's early community products and Clubhouse. Obviously if you had to pick one or two things you got to get right with a new community that you're just forming, what do you think those two things are or one or two things?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:31:38):
Find the niche, start really small and find the niche. I think oftentimes I've seen other startup founders and I invest and advise in a lot of early stage companies. I went through Y Combinator, so I go back to YC as much as I can and go help out folks. But oftentimes I'll see people starting companies or founders coming in and being like, "I'm going to build this product that is going to cater to this community. I'm going to build this world's largest community off this kind of thing," and it almost starts at this super scaled version and then they set themselves up for failure.

(00:32:14):
You're almost better off doing these small, niche, non-scalable things to go find these oddball set of people who are doing this, who are really interested in this one thing and kind of scale from there and grow from there. And I think that's one big thing that when you're starting to build a community, don't start to build this super scaled community. Start with few people who are passionate about a particular problem and want to get together kind of thing. Start there. Two, I think people, and this might be a controversial thing, but I often think people don't think through monetization. If you're a community builder early on, start thinking about, if you're truly focused on this as a business, how would you actually make money off of it?

(00:32:55):
Oftentimes they hit some sort of scale and be like, "Crap, now what do I do? And then they're try all these options, they will have some churn and then they're like, "Oh no, but I thought this was a very sticky community." I'm like, "Yes, but it's not as sticky as this particular price tag." And so you have to start thinking through, if we hit a particular velocity, what is that going to look like? What are the things that I'm going to unlock. And think through monetization a little bit ahead of time before it comes in and becomes a crutch rather than a weapon that you can go leverage.

Sriram Krishnan (00:33:24):
But I want to say, Aarthi is kind of the creator of Facebook Stars and of so much of the thinking there and I can see her go super deep on this. Of course on everything she said, I have a slightly different framework. First of all, I really don't like the word community because the word community, the word networking, the word platform is a little abstract and it can mean a lot of things. And I like to think of things like a dinner party or church or things that seem more tangible and people know, "Okay, I know exactly what that is." So when I think of a community or starting one, I think first of all, it's a party. And you're first starting off, you're like, "All right, what is a vibe?"

(00:33:57):
For example and this is also true for every social media platform where if you can be a crazy, people are dancing on bars, having a great time, getting really drunk party or you can have a really formal dinner where everyone is seated, there is plates with name tags and there's a clinking of glasses and you have to dress up. And they're both fine, they're both fun in their own way, but you need to tell people, as the host, which one it is. And by the way, I think one of the things that Twitter didn't get right in the original days which some of the other apps did, it never told people what kind of party it was. It like, "Are we going to Michelin star restaurant where sit down or it's a sports bar after the Super Bowl and you can go crazy?" And if you don't do that, people make up their own rules. That's number one.

(00:34:37):
The second part is as the host, you have to curate the original set of people and you need a mix, this is super important. I think sometimes people do this thing where they either optimize for "interesting famous people" or they get the most talkative lot of people. And I actually read a bunch of books on hosting great dinner parties, I actually have some interesting suggestions there and it'll say like, "Well, you need a mix." For example, in any organization, let's say you're the VP that everyone knows about, but that VP doesn't have the time to maybe participate on a WhatsApp channel or a Slack channel and chit-chat all the time or show up for everything. And then maybe you need the really boisterous young BD exec who's out and about and meeting everybody. You need that person, you need somebody who's quiet and thoughtful. You need to merge different kinds of energy and that's almost an alchemy and that's more art than science. You have to start there.

(00:35:27):
Third I think is as the host, you have to have a sixth sense of how is a community feeling at any given point in time? Are two people dominating the conversation? That person hasn't said anything in a while. One of the things I like to when somebody joins a group or one of these places, I try and get them into a question which they will feel happy about because you know what happens the very first time you walk into a party? You look around, you're like, "I don't know anybody here. Oh gosh, okay. I know this one person and I'm going to go talk to them," and you just feel nervous. I'm trying to break that. For example, if you walk in a place and you didn't know anybody, Lenny is actually very good at being social, but I'd be like, "Hey. Lenny has one of the most popular things on Substack and he just wrote [inaudible 00:36:04]. I'm just giving you an opening, you to feel comfortable and that's another part.

(00:36:08):
The third part I love is rituals and religions do a great job of this, which is do something every month. There's a little group I hosted some of my friends and during all of COVID, we did a Zoom meeting every Tuesday evening. And that was a ritual, it had nothing, it's just Zoom meeting with a bunch of friends, people can share-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:36:23):
And people would just bring their glass of wine or bring their kids in and there's no structured agenda. But people started looking forward to it through the pandemic and stuff and we would be like, "Oh my God, it's Tuesday. You know this evening, we are going to go do this thing." And it was a really great way to go build that community and I totally agree with that.

Sriram Krishnan (00:36:43):
Yeah, well Lenny has done an amazing job on it on his Slack, I see it.

Lenny (00:36:46):
You're so sweet.

Sriram Krishnan (00:36:47):
The other interesting tension and challenge is how to grow it because I think there are... Interesting point, a four person dinner, very different from an eight person dinner, very different from a 20 person thing where people hang out, very different from, once you start getting hundreds of thousands, the things you're willing to share, worrying about being judged. So I'm always trying to create more intimate different spaces and that's a whole other topic. So I think if you're trying to start a community though, I would say picking the right people, setting the tone, being really part of it yourself, that's most of it.

Lenny (00:37:21):
Amazing. There's so many little nuggets of advice there. I feel like we could do a whole other episode on just community building strategy. Today's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered the stuff, actually from another podcast and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency.

(00:37:55):
LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes, also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try LMNT totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is Watermelon Salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer, stay salty.

(00:38:36):
I want to go back to a topic we touched on that I think is really interesting which is building a brand and putting content out and that kind of thing. I think a lot of times people hear that, like a first-year PM and they're like, "Yes, I'm going to start tweeting." And then it's such cringey useless stuff and nobody needs to hear from them because they haven't done anything. And I guess I'd be curious for your take on, at what point should people start to put things out? How do you know if this is cringey and nobody wants to hear this stuff like, "Great PM-ship," these very cliche things come out. There's like hundreds of Twitter accounts, people are just tweeting these things like, "All right." How do you think about that [inaudible 00:39:14].

Sriram Krishnan (00:39:14):
I actually disagree with you and I actually think everyone should... well disclaimer, I work for firm which has invested in Twitter, but I swear that's not why I'm saying this, people have heard me say this for years-

Lenny (00:39:24):
And Substack.

Sriram Krishnan (00:39:25):
Yup. Everyone should tweet or everyone should post on YouTube or post Instagram and it doesn't matter how young you are. Because I actually disagree with the few things, which actually is a great point which I think a lot of people feel this, one is that you need to have hit a certain bar of accomplishment or interestingness to say something, strongly disagree with that. Second, that things are cringey. I don't think anything is cringey, I strongly disagree with that too. And I think these are both interesting-

Lenny (00:39:51):
Aarthi's face is great.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:39:53):
Wait, I feel like Sriram's bar is so low for-

Sriram Krishnan (00:39:55):
Dude, no, this is really important because I think what stops a lot of people is, I've had probably 100 plus conversations where somebody who's incredibly accomplished will come to me and they'll be like, "Hey, I want to get on Twitter, I want write content or I want to Substack or I want to do a podcast." I'm like, "Great." They're like, "But I don't know what to say, I look dumb, I don't want to get judged." But I'm like, "No, you're so accomplished," and it is the fear of being judged that so often stops people. So whenever I hear that word cringe, I'm like, "No, no, no, that's actually fine, you're fine. You'll figure it out," and here's why I say that.

(00:40:30):
Number one is what the most important thing and even, listen, if you just remember one thing from this whole thing is just get started and do something every single day. And this sounds so basic, like Aarthi and I have is a running joke where it's like it's diet and exercise is what we say. It's like we are talking to people about how do you get healthy and you have the 100 different things you can do or podcasts you can listen to, but most of it's like, "Well, diet and exercise." And with creating content, diet and exercise, you just write a piece of content every single day because what's going to happen is it builds muscle, it gets you familiar with the medium and you start understanding what works in that medium and what doesn't and you start building reps.

(00:41:08):
You know who never works out in my opinion? Is somebody who'll think for weeks, build up an amazing tweetstorm, blog post, newsletter, whatever it may be and then stops because the effort is so high. So I'm like, "One, do something every single day." The second part of it is, I actually think you don't have to talk about what you accomplish, you only have to talk about you. And by the way, this is going to sound very froufrou, but you are the best you out there. So for example-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:41:33):
Wow, okay.

Lenny (00:41:36):
[inaudible 00:41:36].

Sriram Krishnan (00:41:36):
... let's say you are a 21-year-old PM, fresh out of school, first year... by the way, we were all that. I was a 21-year-old PM at one time, Lenny would've been too, lots of others. First you'll see a lot of people who have been through journey and there are others like you. Second is you just talk about your journey, talk about what you're doing, talk about what you're learning. Because what often you're trying to do when you're creating content is to build a relationship with people. So when Charli D'Amelio dances on TikTok, she's not saying she's a professional dancer, she's saying, "I'm relatable, I'm just like somebody you would be friends with next door, I'm just like you." And so then people start connecting with you on that front, if you're authentic and you're doing a good job, and so everybody listening to this should be able to create content.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:42:17):
Okay, so the only place where I disagree, I think this is all right, but this is a bit like, we are Asian, we have this very Asian parent thinking, there are no participation trophies, so if it is cringey, you should at least acknowledge that it is cringey. I think at the end of the day, you have to persevere, I think I give a lot more words to people who are just persevering and showing up every day, but I do think there should be a level of self-awareness for people where it's like, "Man, this is not great. I'm not getting any traction. I need to improve on things and keep building on it," as opposed to being like, "I am the best me ever," and just keep putting out garbage, don't do that. Improve on stuff because there is such a thing as bad content-

Sriram Krishnan (00:43:03):
I agree with you, but I think when people mean cringey... okay, I'll see this. What people think they say cringey, it's like our peer group thinks that this content is too basic-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:43:11):
But everybody has that, whether you say it out loud or not.

Sriram Krishnan (00:43:15):
Well, I'll give you a story. So I spent years, I'd be like, "I'm a PM leader, I run organization, I should write smart PM things. I should write the kinds of things that Lenny writes." For example, I'll say that, "Lenny's Post the other week from Duolingo is... I was so jealous. I was like, "Man, this is the kind of content... I would be like, "It's amazing, banger post." But the problem was when you start doing that, you start censoring yourself. And I'll say, I've written a lot of posts over the years and I'll try and sound smart, I have a great intellectual framework in some of this work, but you know what my most popular post and tweetstorm of all time is? It is how to write a cold email.

(00:43:48):
And when I wrote that tweetstorm, I was like, "Man, I'm going to sound so dumb," because Lenny doesn't need to know how to write a cold email and neither does the VCs I work with, everyone knows that. But the thing is, what is obvious to you and may seem cringey to your peers is definitely not obvious to a lot of people and they will connect to you, they will relate to you. When somebody says like, "Well, is it too basic? How do I get started with my job?" I'm like, "No, there's a lot of people who this is not obvious to," and I'll just put myself out there and what's the worst thing? Somebody thinks you're moron? That's fine. You put some new piece of content out there the next day and they'll fix it or you can just ignore that.

Lenny (00:44:23):
I think there's a lot of really good nuggets here. I think the only area maybe we disagree and we should move on, but this is [inaudible 00:44:29].

Sriram Krishnan (00:44:30):
Listen to me, Lenny, come on. Your podcast is too friendly otherwise, let's listen.

Lenny (00:44:34):
My feeling is I think for helping you do better work kind of content, like entertainment anyone could do no problem, you could be awesome at it, is I feel like you need to do something in your career first before you can start speaking to, "Here's things I've learned and here's what works and here's what doesn't work." I think I wouldn't spend a lot of time sharing all your wisdom before you've done a thing and been successful in some way.

Sriram Krishnan (00:44:53):
Yeah. I actually think you make a very interesting point, which is I think a lot of people online LARP, live action role-play, as somebody else which is like you trying to project a persona or a career point that you are not at and you know it, we know it, you probably admit you know it-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:45:14):
And also for that kind of content, everyone can tell. I think it just comes off as not authentic. I mean I feel like the universe figures itself out over time, but I do think there is a level of, just because Sriram thinks no content is cringey does not mean people all feel that way. You can't just magically just wipe that out. I feel like everyone just feels that way, whether or not you say it out loud. I do think there is a process of iteration and acknowledging that, "Yeah, okay, this is bad, but I'm going to put this out there anyway and we'll just keep working on this," and coming back to it.

(00:45:46):
I really appreciate people who would just do that and just keep coming back to it every day and like Rocky style, chip away at things. I really have appreciation for those folks because it's hard. I've realized over time that everyone is deeply feeling as if they're imposters and we talked about this. Imposter syndrome is so real, it is so gut-wrenchingly real that it's not just every one person, it's most people I think. So to be able to overcome that threshold and look at your amazing peers and your seniors and everybody else and then still be able to put yourself out there, I think we have to really appreciate that and help them go iterate and just get better over time.

Sriram Krishnan (00:46:27):
Yeah, I agree. One tiny story before we wrap on this topic, which is I was talking to somebody who's four or five years into their career as a PM and they'd written this post on LinkedIn which is full of cringey content, by the way. Okay, let me say it, LinkedIn has a lot of cringey PM content-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:46:27):
Wow, look at Sriram.

Sriram Krishnan (00:46:42):
... I'm sorry LinkedIn folks. And it was one of the things about how do you set product strategy as an organization and I was like, I called them, I was like, "Dude, come on. You're four years into your role, nobody believes that you actually are driving this from a place of actually really knowing it. And that is fine if you're learning, but you are trying to project this person you're not." But the thing which I was talking to him, I was like, "I know you've done this amazing deep dive on this other niche topic. You've gone out, you read all the posts, go write about that because you are an expert legitimately in something you think is niche, as opposed to a fake expert on this other thing you want to be."

(00:47:17):
He went and wrote this follow-up post on something very niche and that went really popular because the truth is, there's not a lot of great content out there, especially great content from people who actually done the thing. You'd be surprised how niche you can be, but if you actually done the work, talk to a people, aggregated some posts, people come seek you out and you don't have to do it. So anyway, so lots of LARPing, lots of cringey LinkedIn content for sure.

Lenny (00:47:43):
Just to close this out, I 100% agree with the idea that people should be just trying stuff, writing, sharing stuff on Twitter, LinkedIn, just get it out of there, don't be afraid because that's how you start down this road. I was going to go in a different direction, but you mentioned imposter syndrome and I'm curious, have you two dealt with imposter syndrome and-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:48:01):
Oh, yeah. We have and I still, I don't know about Sriram. Sriram comes off as so much more confident and has so much gravitas that nobody ever thinks of it, but we both do, we both deeply have imposter syndrome. Every single day, anything we do, we look at ourselves, we are creators, we have this show on YouTube and then we look around at everybody else who have millions of subscribers and followers and everything and we are like, "Why are we creators? This is not a thing. We should not be doing this stuff. I just think people haven't been honest with us on how much we suck." It's like you have these loops in your head and then every once in a while, you'll see a comment being like, "This was amazing. I just had to stop doing what I was doing to listen to this whole thing. It was so valuable for me." And you're like, "Oh, okay. We are not all the bad. That's, I think, okay."

(00:48:48):
So we go through this a lot. For the longest time, I had really severe imposter syndrome through school, college, getting into Microsoft. Even after I got through the Microsoft, which we were one of the youngest product managers there, I still was like, "Oh, someday they're going to figure out that this was all... they'll know the real me and they'll be like, 'Oh man, we made this mistake with her.'" And it was just such a real crippling thing for me. Even now I feel like maybe it's not 100% true, but I can kind of see the gradients there, so very real thing.

Sriram Krishnan (00:49:27):
Yeah, it's so true. I have a hack or a technique of how to get over imposter syndrome. But I'll just say, and this is just if folks here feel it, every new job I've been in, I have always felt that I didn't deserve to be there and I mean I genuinely. When I joined Microsoft, I was a young student, I was like, "I don't know anything. These folks are professional, they've been doing this job for years." When I moved to the US I said, "Look, my accent is super intense, I'm Indian, these folks have been doing this for many years, they have very different lifestyles, I don't know what I'm doing here." When I move to Silicon Valley, I got no hired by probably four or five different companies and one of them told me, "You work for Microsoft so you can't really cut it in Silicon Valley because you're from Seattle," which I'll never forget.

(00:50:07):
And I look at the person from LinkedIn from time to time, I'm very typically like, "Well, I've cut it now," and I'm very petty that way. And then of course and then when I start running large organizations, several hundred people or more, I was like, "I've never done this before." I'm in a meeting, everyone is looking to me, "Do they know that I've not done this before? Because I haven't done this before and can they tell?" And it's every step of the way. So it just pushes every step of the way and in the beginning, it was quite crippling, but over time, you build things to help you. And I think for those listening, if you feel this way, the thing I've learned to do is you have to retreat to a place where you feel real mastery of. So for example, when I was at Microsoft, I was like, "Well, I don't speak the language very well, English," and I had an accent, et cetera, but I knew that I was the most online developer person out there.

(00:50:57):
I knew every single online community, I was very plugged into open source, so in every meeting when the topic would come to, "Hey, what is happening with Ruby on Rails?" I was like, "I know this better than everybody else," and I learned to put together a presentation. Because then you start with the base of something that you feel super comfortable in and you build from that. And what you realize when you build from that is you are like, "Oh, actually you know what? People really respect that and they react to that." And I also learned not to do other things. For example, for them for years where I would listen to people from a certain academic background or I'll be like, "I wish I could do slide decks like they could," or, "I wish I could have these intentional... but I was like, "That doesn't really matter. You just need to come from a place where you are confident you've done the work."

(00:51:39):
So if you folks are listening and you feel imposter syndrome, next time you walk into a meeting, just think about, "Okay, this is a place where I know I spend so many nights and weekends," and it can be super tiny, it can be one little button, one customer, but you've done the work, you've had multiple conversations, it is [inaudible 00:51:54]. And you start from there, you talk about that and you build out from that and you will feel comfortable. So I've done that in pretty much every role now and I still catch myself doing-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:52:03):
Yeah, I think for me, when I was a first time founder, I definitely felt that way and there was all this, at that time, which was conventional wisdom. Nobody we knew at that time were founders, it's not our friend circle, they all worked in medium to big companies. My family, nobody has ever been a founder, entrepreneur, it's not a thing. And so when I started this I was like, "Oh my God, I'm making a mistake." But then you read all these people tweeting or writing posts, being like, "If you're a founder you'll be really good at fundraising. Best founders learn how to... I sucked at fundraising. I was so bad at it. It was just like, "Oh, you have to be able to tell your story."

(00:52:41):
I tried. I email like 250 founders, took 85 meetings and 50 plus second meetings and then got 30 checks. This was my seed round which took eight months to close or something and I was like, "Oh my God, I'm so bad at this. I should just give up right now." And then I started building this startup and I was like, "Actually I'm really, really good at understanding customer acquisition and really trying to find creative ways to cheaply acquire customers." And I kind of started putting together playbooks on it, what I can go do there and I tried this, I tried this, then I started talking to few for our own investors and I'm like, "I don't know if your portfolio companies are finding this useful, but I tried these tactics." And they were like, "Oh my God, I'd never heard of that."

(00:53:28):
And so I realized that that's the one place I could be really good at and I can grow my business in a really profitable way very quickly. And then investors started talking to me about other companies and all of that stuff and it became a thing and that helped me get more confidence over time. It was like, who cares if I can't do these other things? I can do these few things and this is really, really important to build a sustainable business and I think I can do that. And that for me kind of helped me get over it. It's not anyone telling me, "Don't worry, you'll be good at it," that never helped, it was just I had to do it myself to figure it out.

Lenny (00:54:02):
It's interesting both of your pieces of advice is find the thing you're actually good at and then just lean into that as much as possible. That's something I learned from an executive coach I worked with once that you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can accomplish almost all the things you want accomplish through the lens of the strengths without using those weaknesses as much and that really was pretty transformative.

Sriram Krishnan (00:54:21):
That's actually such a profound point and I wish somebody had told me that earlier in my career because early in my career, I would get all this advice like, "Oh, Sriram is too loud and too boisterous." And the thing is, nobody I know has ever become successful by trying to fix their weaknesses, it's just impossible. The only way you succeed is one, you might need to mitigate some of them, especially if they're really, really holding you back. But you have to lean into your strengths, which is a weird thing because I think when we do performance feedback, it's feedback and so much time we are like, "Well, these are all the good things and then let's talk about the ways you know can improve."

(00:54:53):
It's almost the flip time and I think if you're doing performance feedback, you'll be like, "Well, these are things you're really good at, let's make you even much better at that. Let's make you fly faster, run harder, close the deal, write better code." Oh yeah, and some people are mad at you for these things. You should watch it and maybe fix some if it's really bad, but that's not what's going to pull you ahead. It's the superpowers that's going to really pull you ahead, so let's focus on that.

Lenny (00:55:15):
Yeah. The way I think about that is the weaknesses can't be liabilities, you can't just get on stage and melt and explode, but you don't have to be amazing. As long as you can email really well, write documents really well, communicate in other ways if that's a strength. One last trick while we're on this topic, I was just reading Hunter Walk's blog and he shared a cool trick for imposter syndrome where you just have to ask yourself, "Am I so good at pretending that people don't see what's actually happening? Am I actually that good to being this imposter? Probably not, the people can tell," and it's really unlikely you're actually an imposter.

Sriram Krishnan (00:55:46):
Also, by the way, the reality is and this a cliche is people are just not thinking about you.

Lenny (00:55:51):
Right.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:55:52):
That's true. Yeah, you're giving other people too much credit that they're focused on somebody else. Everyone is so busy focusing on themselves and their own insecurities and fear and just living life. And think about ourselves, when was the last time we thought about somebody else and were like, "That person, probably an imposter"? We just don't have the time for it.

Sriram Krishnan (00:55:52):
Yeah, I've been thinking about me this whole time.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:55:52):
I am not surprised.

Lenny (00:56:20):
You guys are hilarious. There's something I actually along these lines I was going to ask about. I remember, Sriram, when you were just getting out of the companies you worked at, you made this point that you were an IC and you were in these meetings where people are reviewing your work and they're making decisions and you're the person presenting. And then all of a sudden, you're the person reviewing all their work and making the decisions and no one trained you to be that person where you're like, "Oh my God, I'm that person they're all looking for for all these answers?" And I'm curious just how you worked through that and what advice you'd have for people that are maybe going through that transition?

Sriram Krishnan (00:56:49):
Yeah, it's a good question. First of all, it's kind of a jarring change because you realize, "Well, I have power, but I'm also called upon to do a bunch of things," because no meeting, let's call it an exec review, let's say and you're the exec they're presenting too. It doesn't really matter what your title is. All of a sudden, you're having to do a bunch of things. You're making decisions, but you're also providing feedback, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly.

(00:57:10):
You might piss off somebody by naming somebody and not naming the other person, you might piss off somebody by not inviting them to the meeting. You might have to feel like, "Well, I really want to overrule this person, but if I do, they might get mad at me." And there are so many different things which you have to keep in your head as well as like, "Is this the right path for the team, for the company," or whatever the situation is and it can be really overwhelming. And I learned a lot of how to do great exec reviews from my time at Facebook, from Zuck and from Andrew Bosworth. Andrew Bosworth, Boz, has some great posts on his site, boz.com, about how to do reviews and-

Lenny (00:57:40):
I'm trying to get him on this podcast by the way.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (00:57:42):
Oh, that sounds good. He's great.

Sriram Krishnan (00:57:43):
He's great, he's fantastic. Let me know when you have him, I have some questions I want to get you to ask him. But Boz had a few ways of thinking. First of all, let's start with Zuck. Thing I loved about Zuck's exec reviews was that it was clear when you walked into the room that you are talking to one of the most powerful people on the planet. But what he did which not a lot of other people in this position do, is he would tell you what the rules of engagement were for every meeting or [inaudible 00:58:08]. He'd be like, "Look, I'm going to give you a spectrum of A, how much I care about this topic. Everything from I don't care, I don't know why you're talking to me, do I care kind of care little? I kind of care so I'm happy you're getting this update, do I really want you to do this? But you know what, if you overrule me, that's fine. All the way to I'm the founder, I'm the CEO, just do this." But he will make it clear where he stood on the spectrum.

(00:58:27):
The second thing he would make clear is why he believed the things he did. For example, the very first time I pitched him on what is the Facebook Audience Network which grew into probably one of the largest ad networks on mobile, he had all these sort of ideas, he was like, "We shouldn't do an ad network because," and he had all these opinions on, "Well, mobile ads all look terrible, they are spammy, X, Y and Z." But he was really good at articulating those to you and also saying, "Well, if you can prove me wrong on these legs of my logic tree, I will let you overrule me, unless I have a strong opinion." So when you walk in a meeting, you're like, "Well, I know the framework, I know what the dance is, do you convince him?" Or maybe there's no shot to convince him and that's fine. He's the CEO and that's fine too.

(00:59:10):
So I really learnt that it's so important to clarify for your team the framework you're operating in with you. And it's also maybe a clarifying function for yourself as so how do you actually feel about this and why do you feel like that? That's number one. The second part of it is inside a meeting, there's a few things I think you need to do which is clarify what kind of meeting is it. Is it just an update? "Great. We're just going to get an update? I'm going to listen to you, I'm going to applaud you for a job well done, I'm going to send you on your way." Or is it a decision in which case, what are the pros, cons, et cetera? There are some real big failure modes where one kind of meeting slides into another kind of meeting where somebody is like, "Why are we doing that? Is that a thing?"

(00:59:46):
And then somebody will start fighting on and people are like, "Oh gosh, we shouldn't have brought this topic at all." And everyone listening to this has probably been to one of those meetings. There's also something else which teams sometimes like to do, which is they'd be like, "Hey, we have a hard problem. We don't know what to do." They're trying to kind of push the responsibility of the [inaudible 01:00:02] from them to you which may be fine, but you should be like, "Hey, are you saying that you can't make up your mind and you want me to make up your mind for you?" You want to be very explicit because often I've seen this when there are hard decisions, teams are like, "The exec feels strongly, we don't want to know what to do," and they kind of want to push the accountability to you and here, we watch out for that a lot.

(01:00:25):
There are a lot of hygiene things we think are very important. For example, send out a pre-read before, make sure it's the right people in the room, not everybody, but not missing out key people. Make sure you're paying complete attention, make sure everyone gets a chance to talk which by the way, I was really bad at. And those things go a really long way. Oh, and one final thing, have a regular rhythm to those, so you're doing this every month, et cetera. What I hate, I stole this line from Gokul Rajaram, is the phrase, "Hero meetings." All of us have been this which is there's a big thing, there's a big review, it's probably a go/no-go, maybe it's career limiting, maybe it'll get our team funded and everyone is stressed out. You spent two weeks working on a deck and the first 20 minutes of conversation goes totally sideways because the exec thought of something. Every one of us has been one of those. Those are bad.

(01:01:11):
The way to fix that is to have a regular check in, so you have meeting every single week and becomes like you're not spending weeks, it a muscle, it's a rhythm of what you do and those are reason. Sorry, I went on a bit of a speech there.

Lenny (01:01:21):
What I was thinking about is you two have worked at basically all the big consumer companies and coming back to imposter syndrome briefly, what's the worst product you've built or the biggest failure you've each built and what did you learn?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:01:34):
Oh, man. At a startup, I tried all kinds of things. We kind of grasp at straws and build whatever. And also I think I fell victim to, a lot of startups do this where they'll see some theme that has become a meme with investors and they'll be like, "I'm going to go build that company. I'm just going to take that technology, adopt it." You're kind of start of seeing that with AI now where it's like everything is now an AI company. Of course everyone has incorporated AI part of it is you get it, you kind of want to be in the game and be cool, but if it doesn't really fit with your product hypothesis and thesis and what your customers are asking for, don't fall for that fad.

(01:02:18):
And I did stuff where I totally fell for the fad. I think I had a consumer electronics e-commerce, like a machine learning model where we rent and then recommend the right things to go buy. But then we were like, "Oh, Uber is doing this whole UberX thing where it was people having their cars and they could do this thing." And at that time, I think this whole shared ownership of stuff became such a big thing and I was like, "Oh, I'm going to do that exact thing where it's like it's less-

Lenny (01:02:51):
[inaudible 01:02:51].

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:02:51):
At that time, we were partnering with Best Buy and we were like, "Well, we should do this other side product," which is people's own stuff that they could put up on the site. Total disaster because there is a lot totally different company logistics, everything. You could build it out as a different business, but we had a small team which was heavily focused on this business, was already doing pretty well and then we had to fork all of that effort to go build this other thing which required different skillset, different fulfillment technology and all of that. And so we were like, "Okay, disaster." So we pull the plug on it many months in, but we should have done it a lot sooner.

Lenny (01:03:26):
What you learn from that experience other than pulling the plug sooner?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:03:30):
Yeah, don't fall for fads. It's do the thing that your customers are asking for and are willing to pay for. Or not even what your customers are asking for, but if you have something that is working, don't get distracted. It's very easy to be like, "I'm going to build this five other things and it's all going to accrue value." And I literally talked to another founder last week where they're like, "But I'm building this consumer thing, but I'm also going to do this SDK so I can go partner with these other companies and do this B2B thing." And I'm like, "But you are four people. Why are you doing that? That's crazy." "But imagine catering to 10X the market." I'm like, "Well, but you're going from a consumer payments thing to something like Stripe and that's a very different business, so do you want to go do that and go have that trade-off conversation?" So that was one big learning. At Netflix, we tried this out, we knew it was an experiment. This was before Netflix was cool like 10, 11 years ago, where [inaudible 01:04:27].

Lenny (01:04:27):
Like DVD place?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:04:28):
Yeah. So my job was to build the streaming player software that goes-

Lenny (01:04:34):
No big deal.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:04:36):
Yeah. My job was to go partner with Samsung and Sony and Panasonic and build a software, the SDK that goes into TVs and set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. This is before international, Netflix and original content like House of Cards and all of that, but one of the experiments we tried back then was Netflix 3D. Total disaster [inaudible 01:04:57].

Lenny (01:04:36):
Like on 3D TVs? That was another fad issue. Oh, no.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:05:02):
Exactly, yeah. But we had a lot of OEMs who were like, "3D is going to be really big and you have to go invest in that." So I spent months trying to do this left eye, right eye codec and trying to make this whole thing work with these odd glasses, sitting in your living room trying to do 3D content, which is really hard. I think we tried seven movie titles over, imported it over to 3D and they're like, "I don't think this is such a great experience," and we ended up pulling the plug on it. We knew it was an experiment going in, we knew there was a good exit criteria, but it was kind of a failure.

Lenny (01:05:35):
Sriram, I bet you're going to have a really good one?

Sriram Krishnan (01:05:37):
All my products were huge successes, so I have nothing.

Lenny (01:05:40):
Okay, [inaudible 01:05:40] other way it's going to go.

Sriram Krishnan (01:05:41):
Yeah, what are you talking about? No, I'll say part of the very first thing I worked on and it's complicated because I love the team and I think we did some great work, was we work on something called Visual Studio for Devices. And the idea was-

Lenny (01:05:52):
What was it? Wishlist for what?

Sriram Krishnan (01:05:54):
Oh, sorry. Visual Studio for Devices. This was in 2005-

Lenny (01:05:58):
Oh, like coding on your phone?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:05:59):
No, no.

Sriram Krishnan (01:05:59):
Well, coding for your phone. And the idea was this was before iPhone it, this was the era of Windows Mobile Pocket PCs and Windows Mobile smartphones, so-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:06:08):
Man, the kids listening to this like, "What's he talking about? What was before iPhone?"

Sriram Krishnan (01:06:14):
Yeah. And this was 2005/2006, so right before the iPhone came out, the two years and we were fresh out of school, both of us worked on this. And there was basically an ID, Visual Studio, and we had an extension where you could write code on a slimmed down version of the .NET Framework and you would run apps on these small phones and these small Pocket PCs. And the team was fantastic, we're all still friends and without that, we wouldn't have our jobs or careers, so that's not the point. The point is we all knew these phones were terrible and slow and awful, but what we were told all the time was, "Listen, nobody can change this because the carriers control this market. They determined what software goes on a phone, goes on a device, so this entire ecosystem is all about competing with Blackberry."

(01:06:53):
In fact, the codename for Windows Mobile 5.0 was Crossbow and kind of a little secret which I think is kind of public now, Crossbow was a weed killer, it killed blackberries. And so the whole idea was how do you kind go after the enterprise market Blackberry and work with the carriers? And then in 2007, Steve Jobs comes out and says, "I have three launches for you, actually it's one thing." I remember texting my manager, I was like, "You have to see this keynote," because it was so obvious that this thing was going to change everybody. And everyone in Microsoft was like, "No, it's the carriers who have all the control. They will never let these devices [inaudible 01:07:32]. But actually, it turns out that's not true.

(01:07:34):
I learned two lessons from that. One is the market is bigger than all of you. You can work with the amazing team, you can work with the A plus team, A plus company, but if the market shifts, you can't overcome a bad market or a bad space. The second part is at the heart of it, if you feel some product is bad and if you feel like this new thing, it's just better to use and you can just feel it instinctly, you have to follow the instinct. Because I remember being like, "Yeah, the iPhone is cool, it feels so much better, but okay, maybe they're right, maybe it is the-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:08:04):
All these people are so much more senior than us, clearly they've put so much more thought into this, clearly what do I know kind of thing. And you realize that now, I think over, what, we've done product for 15, 16 years now, and we look at it and go, "We now have these patterns to go match against." We know when something is better, when something is working, when something feels like it's intuitive, you follow that intuition now then and not try and fight it and be like, "But here are all these things where this is not going to get there," kind of thing. It just doesn't work that way, the market ultimately wins.

Sriram Krishnan (01:08:40):
And I think when you're younger, you should really trust your instincts. And instincts can mean, "I just hear people talking about this other thing a lot," or, "I hear that other company's name come up a lot," or, "I tried this thing and... And you may not have the framework to articulate it and you may not trust your instincts, but there's something there and you should learn to listen to that voice. You're like, "Why is that? Why are we talking about it? Maybe they're doing better marketing, maybe their CEO is better on Twitter or they have Lenny Rachitsky as an angel investor or they advertise on your podcast," there we go. I tried to get a plug in there, Lenny. But you have to listen to your instinct because there's usually something there to follow.

Lenny (01:09:22):
I only have two more questions, one is you mentioned framework. I know you have strong opinions on a very specific framework, Jobs-to-be-Done and I know you're not a fan. What do you want to share about why you don't like Jobs-to-be-Done as a framework?

Sriram Krishnan (01:09:37):
All right, I knew you were going to ask me this and I was thinking how do I be kind of balanced in-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:09:46):
Bombastic?

Sriram Krishnan (01:09:47):
No, balanced and give measured answer and say, "Well, every framework has good and bad ways and there are good things and bad things," and I could probably given one of those answers. No, I actually think the more fun thing to do is I'm going to say I hate Jobs-to-be-Done, I think it's a terrible framework, I think no successful company has ever been built on top of JTBD and if you pick JTBD, you're probably doomed and here's why. Let's go back to the canonical example. And there's nothing Clayton Christensen who was a legend, amazing, the milkshake, what is the idea of being the milkshake? You are a person, you go into a commute and you're like, "Hey, I'm going to get this milkshake because it's the exact right quantity and save me on my commute." But they changed it up and all of a sudden, boom, it was not serving the job and look into the thing that actually it is serving the customer for.

(01:10:39):
I'll tell you that's not how actual real companies work because in real companies there are so many different parameters. For example, maybe it is really, really hard to go build that milkshake. Maybe there's another person who opens up across the street who builds a better milkshake than you do. Maybe the cup configuration in the car changes, maybe the supply chain for milkshake changes. But in my world, let me make this more concrete, when you work in social media, there are often so many other agents in the system where you can't focus on one person's equation. I'll give you an example. When you sign up for Instagram right now, when you sign up for Facebook for many, many years, Facebook knew that it needed to get you to 10 friends in 14 days.

(01:11:14):
If you got your 10 friends in 14 days, you were probably going to use Facebook. So it'd be like, "Well, we're going to throw every tool we have at our disposal to get you to 10 friends and 14 days." So if you signed up for Facebook for many, many years, you'll get this little thing called People You May Know. Then you'll have this person who just signed up for Facebook, you go, "Why I'm seeing this person?" It's not because you need a friend, because they need a friend. So what Facebook did was it made your experience slightly worse to make that person's experience slightly better. This was performing no job for you, it was trying to perform a job for them. Was the right trade-off or not? I don't know. We had this problem at Twitter. The single best product launched for the last five years at Twitter was the introduction of the algorithmic ranking and-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:11:53):
God, hearsay. Oh my God.

Sriram Krishnan (01:11:53):
... and it saved the company and power users hated it. They're like, "I know how to control my timeline, I know who to follow," et cetera, et cetera. It turns out though, this is not built for power users. It was really built for a regular person when they sign up for Twitter to be able to give them a great experience because we knew the power users, they already have. And by the way, TikTok really great example of that. So how do you make the trade-off? Do you pick power users or do you pick a regular person? What is the trade-off between them? Jobs-to-be-Done does not tell you that.

(01:12:22):
Let me tell you this. If you go order a package from Amazon right now, five years ago or three years ago, you would've gotten an email, it'll tell you what is that package, what is in it and when it's showing up doorstep. Last couple of years, it doesn't, why? Because Amazon doesn't want Google to have that data inside Gmail system. So it is, for very, very valid competitive reasons, made your experience worse because that's the right thing do for a company. So real life and real product is all about these trade-offs and whenever I've seen people trot out JTBD, it's a tell that they actually haven't dealt with a trade-off, where you have to make one person's life slightly worse in one situation for some other interesting dynamic. Okay, I'll stop with my mini speech [inaudible 01:13:02].

Lenny (01:13:02):
This is my favorite part of the podcast so far. I'm hoping people listen to the end here because this is-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:13:07):
Yeah, I think JTPD, the problem with that is it's just too idealistic. And most frameworks are, but this one just takes it up a notch where it's like it's almost meant for people who are so naive about product building and especially product building at scale. I think it might work for the V1 or just a hypothesis that you're trying to go test out, where it's like, "What is the core value that we are trying to serve for this user," kind of thing. But really V2, V3, it kind of falls apart because you have these super hard trade-offs that you have to make and every company goes through that. So it's almost a little too idealistic in its thinking. I think that's the biggest problem with it.

Sriram Krishnan (01:13:44):
Yeah, and look, I was being a bit bombastic obviously and it does have some [inaudible 01:13:48].

Lenny (01:13:47):
We're going to edit this part out. This is [inaudible 01:13:49].

Sriram Krishnan (01:13:50):
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's may be useful in some niche case which nobody has ever heard about-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:13:55):
For milkshakes.

Sriram Krishnan (01:13:55):
Right, for milkshakes. Yeah, if you're starting a milkshake company, go for it. But I'll say, so people have good [inaudible 01:14:01] what is the alternate, would involve not JTBD, how do we actually figure this out? And I think a much better way and I really understand the early Facebook years, which is systems thinking. Think of all the players in the system, think of all of their incentives and how they interact with each other. So in that milkshake example, your car, the person, the competitor across the road, the supply chain, the profit margin of each person, the podcast they have to listen to, what is each person's incentives that you're trying to drive and look at how they all work together.

(01:14:31):
So for example, so then when you look at the algorithmic rankings case, sure it kind of deprioritized a certain set of people, but it prioritized the other set of people and you could then have a much more rational discussion about whether that trade-off is worth it. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but it's a much better discussion that, "Well, that person wanted milkshake, we're not giving them milkshake," what do you do? That doesn't help you at all. And yes, it may be a good tool in ways that I absolutely have not seen so far, but-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:14:55):
Yeah, also the other tool I think I really like is first principles thinking. Everyone throws it out there, it's kind of become this cliche now, but really think about it as if your product didn't exist and if you had to start over from scratch, would you build it the exact same way for these set of customers? How would you think about it? Oftentimes people hyper-focused on competition and what other company is doing. That almost never matters. Other companies are probably looking at you and going, "What are these guys doing?" And you have to look at it as all of these systems, as Sriram said, but also really think about it as if you had to do this all over again, how would you do this? Is this the right way or are you just inheriting decisions over time and just trying to make incremental changes and trade-offs and stuff like that? I like that way more than trying to think of it as a job that a customer hires you to go do. It just sounds like really naive.

Sriram Krishnan (01:15:51):
It makes you sound smart, I think. But I'll give you an example. Sorry, I have to-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:15:55):
Stop. You just gave so many examples.

Sriram Krishnan (01:15:55):
No, one last thing.

Lenny (01:15:55):
Examples is good. Let's do one more example.

Sriram Krishnan (01:16:00):
One last example, okay. One of my favorite posts from Lenny in the recent times, I don't know when this episode going to go out, is the Duolingo growth post. I've been sharing it all the time, it's exactly one of the best posts I've seen recently. What is the job that people are hiring Duolingo to go do? Help teach them a new language, right? That sounds about right, some version of that. But if you look at that post, what actually saved the company?

(01:16:21):
So they tried dozens of different things, found their North Star metric, the current user retention rate, then they tried leaderboards, realized why leaderboards don't work. Then ultimately, it is streaks that worked up. Tell me how do you use Jobs-to-be-Done to get to a world where, "Hey, we really going to show these fire emojis and you need to kind of get that fire emoji every day. Because what it's really getting at is the sense of [inaudible 01:16:45] so there is no JTBD brainstorming offsite that'll ever get you there. What I've seen quickly, is almost always when you get a great product breakthrough like that, it comes from one person usually having a product intuition about something, about the psychological thing the product delivers and systems thinking. Those are the only two places I've ever seen it up. Okay, I'll stop now.

Lenny (01:17:08):
No, that example is amazing. I was going to talk about how I've actually found it a little useful in my life, but I think that's just going to keep us going-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:17:16):
I was just going to ask you, are you now convinced Lenny, because Sriram has spent 45,000 minutes just trying to tell you why you should not be using JTBD-

Sriram Krishnan (01:17:24):
I'm just going to get canceled by Lenny's audience. Lenny's audience is like, "This is a reasonable podcast." They're like, "I now hate this guy." [inaudible 01:17:30].

Lenny (01:17:30):
It. I think the JTBD industrial complex is going to come after you.

Sriram Krishnan (01:17:35):
It's all mafia.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:17:36):
I think if you see a bunch of mass unsubscribes, I just want to say this is not on Lenny, this is on Sriram.

Lenny (01:17:41):
[inaudible 01:17:41] from your podcast.

Sriram Krishnan (01:17:43):
Yeah, I'm going to get attacked by a bunch of people who are really good at holding offsites and framework thinking.

Lenny (01:17:50):
Yeah. I find it useful in specific cases, not as a scaled product development process, I think which you've run into or just the whole company is run by Job-to-be-Done. One paper was like, "What is the job?" And you're like, "The job is to get them to open that up three times more each day." Yeah. Okay, I know you guys have to run so I have one more question. I have this saying in my family that whenever we do something well, I'm like, "We're making it in America," because we also immigrated from the Ukraine. And as immigrants, you talked about your story of coming to America and clearly making it. You're both at the center of, I don't know, what's happening in tech, which is also at the center of the world in many ways. I'm curious what advice you would give to immigrants and people that have moved here recently or even a while ago, just how to make it and be successful in the US, especially in tech?

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:18:38):
Some of it Sriram covered before, it's put yourself out there, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Oftentimes, for us, it took us a decade plus to feel comfortable doing that because we came in, we look different, we sound different, we have strong accents, the number of times I got told at both startups and before then, "Oh my God, your accent, it's so difficult, I can't hear you," or, "I don't understand what you're saying." I got told before fundraising that nobody will be able to invest in my company because the accent is too strong. You already have these virtual barriers in your own head and then you have people coming and telling you actively that you are different and you can't succeed.

(01:19:24):
Now if I had to do it all over again, I almost think these differences are what sets us apart and makes us unique. And you can do really interesting things with them because you are going to a place where you are rare and that's, I think, a really good thing. So you should sharpen that rareness and do really interesting things with it, whatever that might be. We have this show called Good Time Show, it's Aarthi and Sriram's Good Time Show and we focus a lot on outsiders being insiders or how you started out as... For us, we are quintessential examples of that where we're outsiders to tech, to Silicon Valley, to being in this world and we kind of "made it" to being here. And we often talk about what it takes to do that and whatever your version of being outsider and becoming an insider means. And for us, part of it is not being afraid to put yourself out there, power of cold emails, networking and being really proactive about that. What would you add to that or how do you think about it?

Sriram Krishnan (01:20:25):
I think everything Aarthi said, I don't have much to add. I'll just say if you're listening to this and you're immigrant, A, you're in the right place, B, you're listening to this podcast, reading this newsletter which is probably not your day-to-day today job, so you're already doing something right, so you're going to make it. You're already putting yourself out, you're doing the right things, you're going to make it.

Lenny (01:20:42):
What a beautiful way to end it. Two final questions, where can folks find you online, the Good Time Show, when you on Twitter, wherever? And then how can listeners be useful to you too?

Sriram Krishnan (01:20:51):
They can find us online on JTBD sucks... No, sorry. That's my alt account. Well, we are on pretty much every platform. We are aarthiandsriram.com. That's kind of a home for our podcast, our show, so go subscribe there, but you can find us everywhere. We are on YouTube at again, Aarthi and Sriram, you can find us on Spotify podcast, wherever you get your daily milkshake/podcast and also on Twitter @aarthir and sriramk.

Lenny (01:21:24):
Amazing.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:21:25):
And how can people be useful [inaudible 01:21:26].

Lenny (01:21:26):
Yeah.

Sriram Krishnan (01:21:28):
I would say, this is going to sound like a cliche, but my job is fantastic in a way where if people are building amazing things, I benefit. Because if you build amazing things, odds are you're going to build a great company and then odds are that I'll have the chance to maybe invest or one of my partners will have the chance to invest and hopefully you make a bunch of money out of it. So just go out there and build things, tell me about the things you're building and also just reach out-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:21:55):
Yeah, just reach out, say hi.

Sriram Krishnan (01:21:58):
Okay, let me put it, if you listen to this, send me a DM, send us a DM and send us an email and we will respond and-

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:22:04):
If it is JTPD hate, just send it to him, not me. Just keep me out of it. But for everything else, if it's a nice note especially, send it to me, I will read it.

Sriram Krishnan (01:22:12):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:22:13):
All right. I hope you're ready for some DMs, both of you. Thank you again for being here. You've set the bar high for our first duo guest. Thank you again and goodbye everyone.

Aarthi Ramamurthy (01:22:24):
Thank you.

Sriram Krishnan (01:22:24):

# Mental models for building products people love ft. Stewart Butterfield

## Transcript

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:00):
This is 2014. That was the year that Slack actually launched. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, "I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public."

(00:00:14):
To me that was like, "You should be embarrassed." If you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Slack was famous for being one of the early, consumerized B2B SaaS products.

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:29):
At more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers, and you can put effort into demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
Something else I heard that you often espouse is friction in a product experience is actually often a good thing?

Stewart Butterfield (00:00:52):
It became an assumption that it should always be trying to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension. If your software stops me and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. If people could get over the idea of reducing friction as a number of goal or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something, and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
You started two companies, both famously pivoted. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting.

Stewart Butterfield (00:01:20):
The decision is about have you exhausted the possibilities? Creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):
Today, my guest is Stewart Butterfield, a founder and product legend who rarely does podcasts. Stewart founded Flickr and then Slack, which he sold to Salesforce in one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history at the time. There is so much product and leadership wisdom locked away in his head. I feel like our conversation just scratched the surface. We chat about utility curves, something he calls the owner's delusion, a hilarious pattern he sees at companies he calls hyperrealistic work-like activities, what he's learned about product and craft and taste and Parkinson's law, why you need to obsess with not making your users think, the backstory on his legendary we don't sell saddles here memo, and so much more. A huge thank you to Noah Weiss, Chris Cordell, Ali Rael, and Johnny Rogers for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation. This is a really special one and I really hope to have Stewart back to delve even deeper.

(00:04:59):
Stewart, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Stewart Butterfield (00:05:02):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
I'm even more excited. I'm so honored to have you here. I never told you this, but you've been towards the very top of my wish list of guests I have on this podcast ever since I started this podcast a few years ago, so I'm very excited that we're finally making this happen. I have so many questions for you. My first question is just what the heck are you up to these days? I feel like ever since you left Slack, we haven't heard much from Stewart. I'm curious what you're up to you hopefully or just chilling.

Stewart Butterfield (00:05:28):
I'm mostly just chilling. I left Salesforce two and a half years ago and I have a two and a half year old, so she was actually born three days after my last day, so a lot of time with family and it's an enormous privilege to be able to spend time with young kids while they're young. No new company to announce or anything like that. I do get a lot of emails and texts. Basically every three to six weeks there's this cycle because Cal Henderson who's the CTO of Slack and who also, we worked together on Flickr, so have worked together now for 23 years, have been talking about what we want to do next if there is something.

(00:06:10):
But honestly, the big challenge has been I think these things are destroying the world and what we're good at is making software. So you find some way to make software that helped people use their phones less often, then that would be a big winner, but haven't come up with anything good. A lot of philanthropic work, nothing to announce there yet, but there's some cool projects that I'm working on, and a lot of just personal creative art projects and supporting other artists and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):
To prep for this chat, I talked to so many people that have worked with you over the years to try to figure out what you taught them about building product, building teams, building companies that most stuck with them, that most helped them build amazing products. The first is a concept called utility curves. This came up a bunch across so many people that have worked with you. Talk about what is a utility curve, how you use that to build better products.

Stewart Butterfield (00:07:08):
This is pretty easy because it's a very familiar S-curve where you have, it's flat and it starts arcing up and then there's a really steep part and then it levels off again. And on the horizontal axis, you can think of cost or effort and on the vertical axis, it's value or convenience. It depends exactly what you're talking about, but the idea is the first bit of effort you put into something doesn't result in a huge amount of value. And then there's some magic threshold where it produces an enormous amount of value and then continued investment doesn't really pay off. The most basic example I can think of is let's say you're making a hammer, and on that bottom axis, it's now quality, and if the hammer has a handle that breaks with any impact, then is totally useless. And if you make it a little bit stronger, it's still pretty useless and it's like junk, junk, junk, junk, junk. Okay, good, great. Then it doesn't matter anymore.

(00:08:06):
If you're making an app, okay, this app's going to have users and so let's make a user's table and a database, and so far you have generated no value. The reason I felt like this was so important is because we would talk about a feature, and usually features are thought of as a binary. You either have this feature or you don't. The argument I guess was have we just not invested enough in this or have we got all the value or convenience or quality or whatever that we could get out of this? And we had pointed diminishing returns and it just doesn't matter.

(00:08:46):
I think in many cases, people will add a feature, it's not good enough and so people don't use it or appreciate it, but now you've added some complexity to the app and then people give up or take it back or they try something in testing and they don't get the results they want, and so they decide that this a thing is worth doing. We would try to really investigate and decide whether we were on the first shallow part of the curve, the second shallow part of the curve, or we're just coming up to it. So I think it's a lot easier to understand the value of this when you're talking about a specific app and a specific feature, but I think it was ultimately helpful in getting people to understand whether something was worth it or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):
So just to mirror back what I'm hearing, there's this, if you visualize this curve at the bottom, it's like I don't even know what this is. And then up the curve is like, okay, I sort of get it. And then at the top is, okay, I can't live without this now that I understand what this is for, it feels like it's a really a different way of thinking about getting to the aha moment for someone where they see, okay, saved items, I get it, I need to use this constantly. It feels like this works both for a specific feature and also just for Slack, getting people to even understand here's what Slack can do for you. And then now I can't live without Slack. And essentially this is a lens you use to figure out where to spend product resources because if you don't get up that curve to I get it and I can't live without it, nothing else matters. Is that the framework?

Stewart Butterfield (00:10:13):
Yeah, and I think then you layer on another concept like the, Bezos used the term divine discontent. The line actually moves because once people are familiar with a piece of software or the way a feature is implemented or something like that, their standards go up, and so there's this competition. And again, this axis can be, utility is the best general term for it, but it could be quality, convenience, speed, it could be any number of things, but as you improve your search capability or as you improve your login experience or your forget password experience or your checkout experience or whatever everyone else is as well. And so there's this continued investment and when forget about thinking about a new feature, you're looking at how the product works overall and usually things get implemented once, and then if they're lucky, they get improved upon periodically. Most things get improved upon very infrequently and some things get improved upon never.

(00:11:22):
I want to give an example at the absolute extreme because I actually don't know how long this has been, but I try not to criticize other people's software so much because I'm very familiar with the trade-offs and prioritization and how hard it can be and blah, blah, blah, blah. But okay, so most people have the Gmail Calendar app on their phone. I travel a fair bit. I'm mostly in the Eastern Time Zone, sometimes in Mountain Time, sometimes in Pacific, sometimes in English time, and sometimes in Japan, Central Europe. There's maybe 10 time zones, 12 time zones that I would ever choose. When you hit the option to set the time zone on an event in Google Calendar, on the iOS app, it presents all the time zones in the world in alphabetical order. And I mean, there's probably worse orderings, but there's no value in that.

(00:12:24):
And even when you start searching, it still presents them in alphabetical order by country with that turn. So if I'm in California and I'm trying to set the appointment for next week when I'm back in New York and I type in E-A-S-T and I get a bunch of garbage, okay, Eastern, and then the first one is Eastern Australia, New South Wales, and then Eastern Australia, Queensland, and then Eastern Australia, Daylight Savings and Eastern Australia standard time. And then you're like, "Well, fuck, I can't remember which one is Daylight Savings and which one is standard time?" I could keep going like this for a while. This is an app that's used by at least hundreds of millions of people, presumably every single Google employee. It's bananas how bad it is. There's so many, there's all these clever things you could do. Like you know me, I'm on the West Coast, first option should be the East Coast and vice versa. But it definitely shouldn't be that every time zone is presented with equal value. I don't a couple hundred time zones. I grew up in Canada. Newfoundland has its own time zone, which is offset by half an hour. The population of Newfoundland has about half a million people. Not that many people go to visit Newfoundland, maybe a million people in all of history so like a million and a half out of 8 billion people. And there's Newfoundland, the same with China time, which is like 25% of the world's population in this.

(00:13:51):
Anyway, that was a little bit longer than I intended to go on this example, but it's crazy because no one's going to switch to Gmail or to G Suite, Google Calendar from Outlook Exchange because the time zone picker is good, so maybe in some sense it doesn't matter, but at the same time there's a real value in delighting customers and there's an emotional connection that they form or don't form. And in some cases that could be really positive like they would recommend it. And when they switch companies or decide to start their own company, they're going to choose to use this product or advocate for it because of that emotional connection and vice versa.

(00:14:34):
They'll also be like, "I hate this thing that drives me bananas. I really think we should stop using it," or advocate for the alternative. And I think people just don't appreciate or come back to those things often enough. And then there's this category of really essential parts of the app again like account creation, sign up, forgot password, things like that, that for most organizations very infrequently get a lot of love and iteration and improvement despite the fact that the quality bar has gone up across the board and continually goes up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
Let's go down that rabbit hole a little bit more around delight and craft. Slack was famous for being one of the early, let's say consumerized B2B SaaS products. Slack leaned into delight and experience and craft and a great experience. And you just as a product leader, I'd say are known as very taste forward, very craft oriented leader, which is pretty rare and I think continues to be rare. So there's a few things I want to talk about here. One is taste. I heard at a talk, you gave a talk on taste and you have a really unique perspective on just what taste is, what product taste looks like. Can you share that?

Stewart Butterfield (00:15:49):
There is a lot of you going back to the utility curves again, people who are obsessed with this one little thing and keep on adding more and more detailed improvements beyond the point where it makes much of a difference. But I guess a couple of things about taste. So one is can you learn to develop it? I think so because the word literally comes from experiencing food and putting stuff in your mouth. And can people become better chefs with training? Yes, absolutely. Undoubtedly, some people have a natural advantage and are born with this ability to make discernments that are difficult for other people to make and stuff like that. But you can definitely practice and you can definitely get better. The second thing I'd say is you can create a real advantage for yourself, for your product, for your company by leaning into it because most people don't have good taste and don't invest. You're probably familiar with, again, Jeff Bezos line, your margin is my opportunity and pretty obvious what he meant by that.

(00:16:54):
I would tell the story at Slack over and over again. It actually made it part of the new hire welcome. I'm in Vancouver at our Vancouver office and I'm going for a walk with Brandon Velestuk who's our, at the time creative director for product development, I think that was his title. And we're in the Yaletown neighborhood in Vancouver so there's really narrow sidewalks because it used to be a warehouse district and now it's fancy restaurants and nail salons and boutiques and stuff. And as it does in Vancouver, it starts to rain. We don't have umbrellas. We're walking back to the office and most people have umbrellas and we're on these narrow sidewalks with people coming towards us with umbrellas. We noticed how few people would move their umbrella out of the way. And of course, the other person, their umbrella, the pokey bits are exactly at eye level for people walking towards them. We would get forced off the sidewalk or having to duck down or whatever.

(00:17:54):
It became a game like we were guessing is this person going to tilt their umbrella out of the way so we can pass or not? And something like one-third of the people would do it. And we had this conversation about it where it's like, okay, I can think of three reasons why people wouldn't do it. One is they have very few avenues in their life to exercise power and this is one of them. And they're just, want to get out there and dominate people and cause suffering. Shouldn't ascribe to malice that which can be ascribed to ignorance so that probably is the explanation for a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of people.

(00:18:34):
But the other two explanations aren't that great either. One is that they see it's happening, they see they're pushing other people off the sidewalk or poking them in the eye or whatever, and they're just like, "Fuck, that's too bad. I wish there was something I could do about that, but I can't think of anything." And the last reason is they just don't notice it all. They're just oblivious to their impact on other people. And they're so in their head, and I can't really think of any other explanations for it besides that.

(00:19:03):
And so we would say it's not like tilting your umbrella is our opportunity. That's not a great rephrase of your margin is my opportunity, but your failure to really be consider it exercise this courtesy and really be empathic about other people's experience is an advantage that you can create a critical advantage. I think that there's many reasons why Slack was successful at the moment. It was successful and we think we had a bunch of really wonderful tailwinds and all of that stuff, but it wouldn't have grown the way it did without those little conveniences which caused people to form an emotional connection because a lot of our growth came from startup A uses Slack, and then someone leaves startup A for startup B, and startup B doesn't use Slack yet. And they would be like, "Oh my God, you guys, you really, this is so good. We got to try it." And the spread was driven by that and people really genuinely advocating for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):
That is an amazing metaphor. I love that one moment became a value of product craftsmanship at Slack.

Stewart Butterfield (00:20:14):
Tilt your umbrella was a very common saying on company swag and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there an example, I imagine there are many, but from the time of building Slack, especially in the early days where you chose to go big on craftsmanship and experience and delight versus speed where you thought looking back that was a really great idea and worth really core just to success.

Stewart Butterfield (00:20:37):
Here's a bunch of little examples. Someone else came up with this idea, and I'm trying to remember who it was, but let's see, maybe Andrea Torres, maybe Ben Brown, something like that who was like, "Why did we ask people for email address and password if their ownership of the email address was the thing that allowed them to create the account in the first place? Why don't we just ask them for their email address and then send them a link?"

(00:21:07):
And so when Slack's first version of the mobile app came out, we're like, "Typing your password on your phone if you have any minimal threshold of password hygiene is a terrible experience." Capital H, lowercase Q, six, caret, period. So let's just have them enter the email address. We'll send them a link. The link will automatically open the app and authenticate them. And so there's one, a little example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:33):
Wow. So you guys invented the magic link experience.

Stewart Butterfield (00:21:36):
Someone else invented. I want to be clear that I had seen that idea somewhere else, someone else, a blog post about it or something like that. But we were the first ones, to my knowledge, that really scaled that and made it a standard. There is another one which we really puzzled about in the very early days where people have a long history of using messaging apps from AOL Instant Messenger to SMS to WhatsApp, where their expectation is they get a notification for every message that's received. And in the case of Slack, that doesn't make as much sense because you're a member of many channels and the messages may not be for you, and so that's why we have the @ tagging people. And we certainly didn't invent that, that was Twitter.

(00:22:23):
But what we realized was people were signing up for Slack, and it's one engineer on this team inside of this larger organization, inside this larger company, and they would pull in the person next to them and they would say, "Let's try it out."

(00:22:35):
And then they would send a message and then one person would be like, "I didn't get a notification. This is bullshit."

(00:22:43):
We reluctantly decided that we had to send notifications for every single message as the default for new accounts. But once you had, I don't remember what the threshold would happen, I think it's once you had received 10 messages, we would pop up this little thing that says, "Hey, you have our default settings for notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our-"

Stewart Butterfield (00:23:00):
... For notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our recommended settings? And then they would just click a link and it would have what should be the default, which is, you only get a notification if it's a DM or someone tags you. But we realized it was worth that investment to get people over the hump. I'll give one more simple one and then one kind of more complex. One, people would just like the, I can't remember if it's called urgent or important, but the flag in Outlook, set the priority of a message for the recipients always got abused inside of every company. As soon as someone does it, everyone's like, "Okay, I'm going to do that too for my message."

(00:23:41):
And so all of your messages have the little flag and it becomes useless. We have @everyone, which causes a notification to be sent to every member of the channel when the message is sent and people would start, someone would find this feature inside of a organization. They would @everyone, everyone would get a notification and then the next person to send a message who was like, " Well, my thing's more important than Bob's thing. I'm going to also @everyone." And it became really obnoxious and people would complain about it, but it was, I don't know, I guess tragedy of the commons. It's not quite exactly the same thing, but it was this real dynamic that happened over and over again.

(00:24:16):
So we came up with what was called the shouty rooster, and internally we said, "Don't be a cock." But we didn't obviously say that publicly when you @everyone, a little rooster would pop up and it would have you sound waves coming out of its mouth and being really obnoxious and say, "Hey, this is going to cause a notification for 147 people in eight different time zones. Are you sure you want to send this message with the @everyone?" And of course, that worked amazingly and it dropped off. And again, it was really trying to shape people's behavior so that they used, one is not to be very flexible, but we knew that there was ways to use it that would be annoying and difficult for everyone. And so try to shape the communication culture inside the organization to take best advantage on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That feature still exists. I see that rooster all the, no, I don't see it all, well, actually I do @channel, because I run a big Slack, so I see that rooster, that survived.

Stewart Butterfield (00:25:11):
Yeah. Yeah, that survived and good because it was a trivially easy thing to implement and made a really big difference. But it also taught people how the product worked, because people probably didn't know that @everyone or @channel... Didn't think about the cost, at least.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:31):
Genius.

Stewart Butterfield (00:25:32):
Yeah. Here's one more. So we decided we were going to Do Not Disturb as a feature. And we had this, not conundrum, but you're trying to take into account all the different uses of Slack because by the time we implemented this, 2017, there was tens of thousands of paying customers, the organizations, hundreds of probably millions of users, maybe hundreds of thousands of organizations. I don't remember how many. And everyone had set up stuff the way that they liked it, including things like ops alerts going into channels for on-call engineers for some of the biggest systems and apps in the world. And so we couldn't just deploy it right away. We realized that some of the decision-makers, the owners of the organizations were going to have really strong opinions about this. We also realized that some of the end users are going to have strong opinions, and we wanted to figure out a way to balance the concerns and give people appropriate means of control.

(00:26:37):
So we came up with this really elaborate system for the rollout, which was, we told everyone, I'm sorry, every Slack administrator that this was coming weeks before it came. And we told them that we were going to set a default for their organization, which I believe was either 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. in their local time zone, or 8: 00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M., I can't remember which it was, but also that they could override that default, and also that the individual end users could override that system owner default. And finally, that the system owner could, if they changed the default again, would override all of the end user's preferences and then the end users could override them again. And it wasn't to create this dynamic where people were at war, but so that you could change a policy and then people could still customize and stuff like that.

(00:27:32):
But this was a much longer and more convoluted process, but it allowed the millions of people who were using Slack to get the feature without creating a bunch of conflict and without people turning it off automatically. And I think critically, with setting a bunch of defaults, because if we didn't set the default, most people wouldn't turn it on at all. If we didn't default you to Do Not Disturb from 8:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M. you probably, if you're the average person, wouldn't ever do it yourself. So that's another elaborate example where I think that investment made sense because it was a critical feature for a lot of people. And if we hadn't done it that way, I think it would've caused a lot of complaints and conflict and stuff like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:22):
Those are amazing examples. I very much appreciate that Do Not Disturb feature when you guys launched that. I still remember that coming out. I'm sure a lot of people are very thankful for that.

Stewart Butterfield (00:28:30):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:31):
Something else I heard that you often espouse, which is counterintuitive to a lot of people is about friction, friction in the product experience. That friction is actually often a good thing. It's a feature, not a bug a lot of times if you use it well. Talk about your experience there.

Stewart Butterfield (00:28:46):
Yeah. So yes, and there's also another issue around friction, which is it became like a mantra or just kind of an assumption that you should always be trying to remove friction. And in some cases that's true. We would talk about it in Slack. It was hard to market. It was hard to explain what it was if you had never used it before. You could say a messaging app for businesses or whatever, but a critical disadvantage to Slack doing out-of-home advertising, putting up a billboard versus beer or cars is, no one needs to be explained why they would want a car or beer, but everyone will have to explain one day why they want Slack. And so the problem there is comprehension, and this will come up an enormous amount. So now imagine you want to get tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in San Francisco and you go to the Ticketmaster website.

(00:29:43):
If you think about both your comprehension, it's perfect to this case. And that translates into the specificity of your intent and the degree of your intent is also kind of maxed out. So look, I really want to get these tickets. I know exactly what they are. They're Taylor Swift tickets for this date at this venue. And so in that scenario, it doesn't really matter if Ticketmaster's website is slow, it doesn't really matter if the payments page errors out, you're going to persist and get through it. So obviously they're better to reduce friction, but in some sense there's not a huge amount of value in doing that. For most creators of products, there are a handful of cases where that really is true for you as well. And they include things like user registration, authentication, checkout flows for e-commerce. I am significantly more likely to buy something if there's Apple Pay or Shop Pay or something like that.

(00:30:44):
I'm significantly less likely to carry through the purchase of something if I have to manually enter all of the fields of my address one at a time rather than having one of those address pickers. It's crazy, but the issue is my intent isn't always 100%, and the specificity of my intent isn't always 100%. So if your thing is direct to consumer T-shirts and you acquire customers through Instagram ads, all of them know what T-shirts are. It's like, "This looks like a good T-shirt to me." But I'm rarely 100% intent. I might have a very specific intent, but my intent's like 70%. So if you're, the amount of friction is above that, I'm not going to do it. But now, okay, people coming to Slack.com, some friend had mentioned Slack and talked their ear off at some point months ago, and then they saw a news article and then they saw someone's tweet and then they saw an ad on about the website they were visiting and they finally said, "Okay, I'm going to go to this website."

(00:31:46):
So their intent is at the absolute minimum threshold, it was before that last event happened, they were below and now they're above, but they're just above. The specificity of their intent like, "I need to get Taylor Swift concerts for this date at this venue." Is also very low, because they're like, "It's a work thing. I'm not sure it's a spreadsheet or a calendar or exactly what it is." So they were coming in at 0.1% over these critical thresholds. What was the challenge? It wasn't friction, because it's not like they were aiming for something and they knew what they were aiming for and they were just trying to get themselves to that point.

(00:32:34):
What we had to worry about was creating comprehension and in two senses, what is this thing? And what am I supposed to do next? And that creation of comprehension in the sense of explaining stuff, that creation of comprehension in the sense of the design of the UI, of the screen, of the page or whatever, and the visual hierarchy and the affordances that are there and the indication of things to interact with and which thing should be the next thing to do and all that stuff, that becomes really critical.

(00:33:09):
And I think very, very few people recognize that. They're like, "I want to get people who come to my webpage to the sign up form as quickly as possible." But if they don't know what they're signing up for and they don't know what it's going to do after, is it going to spam them? They don't know, "Am I going to have to pay on the next step or what?" Then they're just going to back out. And this was a lifelong battle because the remove friction orientation is so deep in people. Again, it really makes a difference in those cases where people do have an intent and they do know what they're trying to do is a poor approach when the challenge is really comprehension, and I think the secret is most, 70%, 80% or whatever of a product design is in that comprehension step because people, if they do ever open the preferences tab and look at all the options, rarely have an idea.

(00:34:09):
And if you can't teach them or make it possible for them to discover what the capabilities are, then they're not going to take advantage of them and they're not going to get as much out of it. And I think that the trick is for most of the unique parts of any application, most of the specific things that your app, your product, your software does are areas where the challenge is going to be comprehension inside of friction. It really could be anything Shopify, the purpose of the service for its end users is generally going to be kind to clear. But most people, most first-time store openers don't know that they can get reports or if they know that they can get reports, they don't know what kinds of reports. And if they know what kinds of reports they can get, they don't know how they can tweak them and what the timing should be and which things that are more important to display.

(00:35:03):
And I could go on and on and on and on, and people just don't recognize that. So I want to see if this is still true. I'm just going to open my phone and clock app. And they had the craziest description for alarms. It's a little bit different, but people can look at their own phone. So I have, it says alarms and it says sleep and a vertical bar, wake up and says, no alarm, and a button that says change. And then if you hit it, it says sleep is off. In order to automatically turn on sleep features and edit your schedule, you need to turn sleep on. So obviously sleep was a good name for this thing if you already had a way of getting people to understand it. If you don't, it's ungrammatical and incomprehensible and why would you ever do it? And I got to guess, it's been like this for years, 90 plus percent and maybe 98% of people just do what I do, which is that you just create, "I want the alarm on and I'm going to set the time for it."

(00:36:11):
And I don't know what turning sleep on does, but it's just the lack of comprehension prevents people from getting the value. And I'm sure that there's a bunch of value behind turning sleep on, whatever that means and people spend a lot of time on those features and it integrates with biometrics and your watch or who knows. Again, I still don't know because turning sleep on is like, what does that do? And what is it going to cost me? And what impact it's going to have? Those examples are just to me all over the place. And the reason I don't use most software where there was an actual choice point or the reason I don't use most features where there was a choice point for me is because I didn't understand what they were going to do and I don't give a shit. And if there is one mantra that I would use to replace that it's, Don't Make Me Think, I don't know if you remember that book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):
Absolutely.

Stewart Butterfield (00:37:04):
Yeah. And honestly, it's been many more than 10 years since I read it, so I don't even remember all of the examples in the book, but as a mantra that was up there with utility curves because for two reasons. One is it's just like it's expensive to make a decision. You literally burn glucose. There's a metabolic action. There's ATP created in the mitochondria and your neurons and a bunch of stuff is happening and people do get decision fatigue and there is cognitive cost of all these things. But also there's an emotional aspect, which is, if your software stops me a second and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. I'm like, "I don't understand this."

(00:37:50):
Some people, maybe their orientation is, "Okay, the software is stupid." But I think most people are like, "Oh, I'm dumb." And if you ever talk to people who aren't especially technologically savvy, the canonical example is people who are under 50 talking to their parents about using some piece of software and what they're supposed to do, the parents always feel stupid like they're the ones that are wrong. And so if you're causing people to think, in the best case, it's unnecessary use of their biological resources, and in the worst case you've now made them feel bad, emotionally bad, and they're going to associate that with the product forever. And these are things that are just kind of rolling one into the other.

(00:38:35):
So I'm going to keep going with one last thing, because they just kind of come together, which is along with reduced friction, it's like reduce the number of clicks or taps it takes for someone to accomplish something which is almost always exactly the wrong thing. It's the easiest way you could make any action in your app, a single click or tap by just exposing every single possibility on one screen that scrolls for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages. And obviously that's terrible. So why do people think that a little bit of that is good? And here's an example. You open a menu, there's 14 things that people might want to do.

(00:39:22):
Level one is group them into like items and put a vertical, sorry, horizontal divider between them so at least people can kind of chunk and see what there is. Step two is present the two or three most common things or the five most common things, whatever and then have some form of other and then you go to a sub menu that has more items and the decision of how to tune that becomes incredibly important. I'm going to pick on Google again just because it is, I feel like I'm Donald Trump here, but I'm going to interrupt myself again with a story. It's-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:57):
Yeah, let's do it.

Stewart Butterfield (00:39:58):
At some conference or event, I don't remember what it was, and this is probably eight years ago and we're in the bar after the sessions ended at this thing. John Collison from Stripe is there and Sundar, CEO of Google is there. And John, sorry, Patrick goes up to Sundar and they can talk about anything. Stripe wasn't the behemoth, it was now at that point, but it was still a significant company, was up and coming. And what does Patrick want to talk to the Sundar about? It's in the Gmail app, the dragging of people. When you reply all to a message, you often want to change the two recipient to CC and move someone from CC to two or something like that. And just how physically the degree of dexterity that's required to do that inside of the Gmail app is very high.

(00:40:56):
It still hasn't been fixed, but it really struck me that Patrick could have asked for anything. It could have been any talk, it could have been a partnership. It was so irritating to him that it worked like this, he couldn't quite get over it. So anyway, back to bashing on Google, who in many respects do an incredible job and there's all kinds of amazing stuff they do on blah, blah, blah, but the Gmail actions on an individual email are broken into two very long menu items that are different. And one of them doesn't exist on either menu. There is an unlabeled icon is the only way to do it, and that's to mark something as unread once it's read. I have no idea why some of the actions are in one menu and some of the actions are in another menu. I think it's because some of them have to do with an individual email and some of them have to do with the whole thread, but it doesn't seem very consistent.

(00:41:55):
Every possible thing is listed there in one place. And so it becomes incredibly difficult to use because sometimes you have to tap in both menus, read all of the options, and say, "Okay, I've used the process of elimination and it's not here, so it must be there." Uber doesn't work like this anymore, but when I first brought this up to people inside of Slack, there was a moment when the Uber app, when you opened it was just, "Where would you like to go?" And other. And other was everything like change your payment method, set your location, anything you could do in Uber. And that was perfect because almost all the time people just wanted to choose where they wanted to go. Sometimes you wanted to change where your pickup was because you weren't there yet or whatever. And that was just like, what could be simpler than, "I'm going to tell you where I want to go or I'm going to achieve something else."?

(00:42:47):
I really tried to push people to what is the thing that people, or what is the two things or what is maybe three things that people could want to do here and then put everything behind other. And then if it takes them eight clicks or taps to do something, but every single one is trivially easy, that's great. If you reduce that to two clicks or taps, but every part of it is this fraught decision where I'm opening all of the menus and trying to figure out which thing is the right thing, and the more, comparing three things to each other is this difficult four things, it's kind of geometrically more expensive to compare 15 different options all to the other to see if this is the one that you might want. That just becomes impossibly expensive. So to me, those are all really connected. And if people could get over the idea of reducing friction as the [inaudible 00:43:42] or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software? How can I make this trivially easy? One last example, because this was really influential for me. So I was going back and forth in Vancouver in San Francisco at the time when we were talking about all this inside of Slack, and I was behind a teenager in line aboard the plane and it was like, we're on the jet way. It took a long time. And I was watching her use Snapchat and it was insane.

(00:44:11):
She was tapping at least four times a second, sometimes six or seven times a second. It was like dismissing stories and doing stuff. But there was a fluidity to it because everything was like, do I want to see this again? Do I want to see the next story from this person? Do I want to switch to a different person? Instead, a notification came up, she answered someone's thing, she took a selfie of herself and everything was just like... So she was tapping four times a second for six minutes. I mean, probably there was some breaks in there. And that was the highest and best use of Snapchat for a 15 year old girl in 2016 or whenever that was. And imagine if the goal was to try to make her tap less, how much of an impediment it would've been to the experience that both her and Snapchat wanted to create?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):
It's so fun to listen to this and the examples you gave of, it gives us a lot of insight into the way your mind works of just constantly unsatisfied with the way other products work with your product. And I think that's core. Patrick is a good example of Stripe. I feel like that's a recurring theme with very successful product leaders is just constantly unsatisfied and unhappy with how things work.

Stewart Butterfield (00:45:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:28):
I love just even the way you summarize this, just a really good reframing of, instead of obsessing with reducing friction and reducing steps, instead think, how do I reduce the amount of thinking the user has to do? I've never heard of it described as, you have to think about the ATP and glucose being used to actually think, and your goal is to reduce that versus let's just reduce friction, reduce clicks.

Stewart Butterfield (00:45:52):
Yeah. I think in my more cynical examples, I would say to people, " Stop what you're doing for a second, close-"

Stewart Butterfield (00:46:01):
Stop what you're doing for a second. Close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths, and then pretend that you're an actual human being. And open their eyes again, and then look at this thing and see, can you figure out what it's supposed to do or say. Or what action you're supposed to take or what the impact will be if you take that action. There's a whole nother related cycle. But before I get into it, I know that I am verbose. I want to wrap up your last example of people being unsatisfied.

(00:46:31):
So here's the quote that I was trying to find. This is 2014, so like that was the year that Slack actually launched officially in February. And this is now near the end of the year. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, "Oh God, yeah. I try to instill this into the rest of the team, but certainly I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public. Not everyone finds that motivational though."

(00:47:06):
So I came into the office the next day and people had printed out on like 40 pieces of 8.5 by 11 paper that quote, and pasted it up on the wall. But to me that was like, you should be embarrassed by it. It should be a perpetual desire to improve. You should probably be like, "Oh, this is great," and you could be proud of individual pieces of work. But in the aggregate, if you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product, or you shouldn't be in charge of the company, or you shouldn't almost nothing.

(00:47:45):
Again, you could reduce it down to a tiny feature is anywhere close to perfect. And if A, that's acknowledged freely inside the organization. And B, people think about continually improving as the goal. And that could be like Six Sigma Toyota, Kaizen, that kind of side of thing. Or it could be that story that... I can't remember his name right now. The guy who started Bridgewater tells about Michael Jordan-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):
Ray Dalio.

Stewart Butterfield (00:48:12):
Yeah, Ray Dalio in his book talks about Michael Jordan learning to ski. Every time he messed up, he wanted the ski instructor to tell him exactly what he was doing wrong. Because to him, every one of those was a gem that he could collect, and he could actually become a good skier. And what he wanted to do was become a good skier. That requires a lot of trust inside the organization.

(00:48:36):
But if you can get to the point where like, "Hey, we are trying to find improvements. We're trying to be critical because you're trying to make this as great as it can possibly be." And not always, not with every person, but most of the time with most people, you can get them to the point where that really direct criticism is actually motivational. It is like people are grateful to have the feedback, whether that's coming from their peers inside the company or from end users of the product. Because you realize, oh yeah, that is bad and we should fix it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
This episode is brought to you by Lovable. Not only are they the fastest growing company in history, I use it regularly and I could not recommend it more highly.

So if you've been sitting on an idea, now is the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at Lovable.dev. That's lovable.dev. This makes me think about, let's call it a rant that you have about how it takes a lot of work to make anything work at all. That just the default state is not working. Can you just share what you share there.

Stewart Butterfield (00:50:13):
Yeah. I mean, so this is a lot to do with, and maybe this is more recently, it shows up in politics a lot for me. But by the way, if anyone listening to this can help me find this tweet store from somewhere between 2016 and 2020, I don't have a precise idea. And it was this guy's thread about how hard it was to get a stop sign set up. And I believe it was in response to someone claiming that Bitcoin is going to replace US dollars, something about crypto. And his point was like, here's what happened when we tried to get a stop sign put up on a residential street in my neighborhood. And the literal years it took, and the number of agencies that were involved.

(00:50:58):
Like the engineering department, traffic planners, the HOA, and... I don't remember all of the organizations because, and I did that I could search better and find this again. Because it was truly a masterpiece of how difficult it is to get a stop sign put up in most places. The message that I hear from most politicians, and unfortunately this works really well, is things should be good. But they're not because someone is doing something bad, which is preventing the goodness.

(00:51:29):
So billionaires are making things unaffordable. Or immigrants are taking your jobs. Or lazy freeloaders are sucking off a government tea, and causing us all have to pay more taxes, or something like that. The reality is almost nothing works. It's actually another call. I said in this case, John has a great encapsulation of this and I'm sure you're familiar with it, like that. It ends with the world as a museum of passion projects. Because for anything to get done at all requires not just the resources and effort required to instantiate that thing in the real world, but all of the politicking and the sociology and the convincing.

(00:52:15):
And there's a book called Why Nothing Works Recently, which is like, it's not an... I'm sorry to the author, if they... I doubt they're listening, but just it's not like an amazingly written book. I found it a little bit repetitive, but the content was really incredible, just explaining why it's so hard. And how there's this progressive increase in the number of vetoes that are available for any kind of course of action and how difficult it is... And this shows up in permitting for new construction and stuff like that. But also shows up obviously inside of organizations.

(00:52:55):
And the challenge is that people, A, I think this is evolutionary biological. It's hard for us to understand the world, except by anthropomorphizing it. And so if it didn't rain this year, it's because a God is mad, and probably because we didn't sacrifice enough goats or something last year. It's hard for people to understand just that, wow, weather is incredibly complex and chaotic, and ecosystems and climatology, and all that.

(00:53:27):
Same thing with the world. Like if I am struggling to pay all of my bills and be able to afford a little bit of luxury in the sense of location or a present for my kids or whatever, it's got to be somebody's fault. There has to be a decision that's made somewhere. And the reality is everything is so complicated. Everything is so multivariate, it's not satisfying. It's a terrible political message.

(00:53:56):
It's much easier to say that there is like, oh, we understand why things are bad in the way that you're concerned about. And it's turns out that it's some someone's decision, and because of them it's bad. And so if we got rid of them or were able to overcome their decision, overturn it, and institute our own thing, then things would be good for you. And this really to me shows up inside of those organizations as well. I'll pause there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):
I know kind of along those lines, you're a big believer in something called Parkinson's Law.

Stewart Butterfield (00:54:31):
Yeah. So the original of that is, I think it's 1956. It's an article in The Economist by Parkinson. And the Maxim is work expands to fill the time available for its completion. And the way that it shows up, this is a little bit subtle. So like one of the things I found, since I don't have a job is there's much less time pressure. And that maxim, like if you want something done, give it to a busy person. The inverse is also true that like, if you're not that busy, wow, basic things take a really long time.

(00:55:09):
And so Parkinson actually starts out with his example of writing and posting a letter. And I don't remember who he used with the first example, but someone who's incredibly busy and has all these things they have to respond to. And then another case like a retired robot who has all the time in the world. It takes her a long time to write the letter. It takes her a long time to put it in the envelope, and then you go to the post office and post it.

(00:55:28):
But the real meat of it is, for me later when he talks about the size of the organization, and he uses a bunch of examples. This is again 1950s, and he's British, so he's looking at the Royal Navy. And specifically he's looking at a chart that shows the relationship between the number of capital ships in the Navy, the number of sailors, and the number of administrators. And very familiar graph for people looking at any part of government. Any part of the relationship between the number of administrators at a university and the number of students and faculty, teaching faculty. Where it's like, okay, the number of ships goes like this and the number of sailors is looking right along with it. And the number of administrators goes like this.

(00:56:14):
And the reason this ties into the work expands to fill the time available for its completion is people hire, and they train. And here's the sad truth for anyone running a company is there are exceptions. There's certain types of engineers that are an exception to this. But the overwhelming majority of people you hire want to hire more people who report to them. And it's not because they're evil, and it's not because they're stupid. In fact, they're smart because everyone knows that the number of people who report to you correlates with your career trajectory, the amount of money that you're paid. The amount of authority you have inside the organization and on and on and on.

(00:56:57):
So we would hire 27 Royal product managers in Slack who immediately want to hire someone. It's like, what the hell? What would that person do? And they articulate it this way, but essentially it's like, "Well, that person would do the product management and then I would do strategy."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):
Classic.

Stewart Butterfield (00:57:12):
It's really, I think the essential thing to understand about this is it's not because people are evil, and it's not because they're stupid. And it's to me, very related to everything is complex. And if maybe this is my butterfly's law, I haven't thought about this way before. But I tweeted this a very, very long time ago like if you... Everything is simple if you have no idea what you're talking about. So the other side of that is like if something seems simple, probably you don't understand it. And there's obvious exceptions to that.

(00:57:53):
But for anything that involves a large organization or a lot of human beings, if the problem seems simple, you don't get it. So every budget process, no head of engineering know, head of sales, no CFO, no GC, who's ever going to come back and say, "Oh, I've actually think next year we can just hire fewer people. Or we're going to keep it flat or we're going to shrink through attrition because we don't need any more people to do what we're doing." Not because they're evil, not because they're stupid, but it's almost overpowering impulse inside the organization that often leads to disastrous results. And so there's an...

(00:58:30):
I'll give one example from Slack's history, and I have tried in the past to disguise this example so that no one feels bad about it but I... Unfortunately, the specifics are so important to the example that it's not disguised and so I'll just reiterate that the people involved aren't stupid or evil. And one example that's from the outside. So the example inside of Slack was we introduced threads, which was the ability to reply to a message inside of a channel. And let's say you, Lenny, post a message. I, Stewart reply to it. You will automatically get a notification. And now Sarah later on replies to the same message. Both you and I, as people who have push in that thread will receive a notification that there's been more activity, and so on. So like every single time anyone replies to it.

(00:59:23):
So when the feature first was released or like when we did the final product review before it was released, the input box was pre-populated with at the person before you in the thread. And I was using the feature and I would put the insertion point there, select all delete, and then start writing my message. And even if I wanted to add someone specifically, I almost never wanted to start my sentence with at that, because it just made it hard to reference what they were saying before. So I said, "Get rid of this because, A, I think most people won't use it. Or if they did want to add someone, they're not going to want to do it at the beginning of the sentence.

(01:00:07):
And by the way, you're teaching them to use the product wrong. Because it's important that everyone understand that every previous poster in this thread will automatically receive a notification unless they've figured it."

(01:00:20):
So okay, we release it. Six months goes by and suddenly the at thing comes back. And so I messaged someone around the team and I said, "Hey, there's been a regression. This is super weird. I don't know what happened. But the at thing came back." And they said, "Oh no, this is on purpose. We did a bunch of research." And so I was like, "What?" And I went through this and it was, if I recall correctly, it wasn't even P-95 certainty on this analysis. But it was something like when we do this, threads are 2.17 messages long, versus 2.14 messages long on average for when we don't do it.

(01:00:59):
And so first of all, why is a longer thread better? Like maybe a shorter thread is better? It can be fewer messages that people have to go back and forth. Also, that's such a tiny difference. Also, again, I don't remember the actual statistical analysis, so I'm not going to claim that it was incorrect. But I'm pretty sure this was outside the bounds of certainty that they can have. But the real thing was, oh my God, so you guys put flags into the product, you A-B tested it. You did the instrumentation. You created tables in the database or whatever we're using to record all of that.

(01:01:39):
You wrote queries to pull that. You created charts based on that data. You had meetings to discuss it. And just kind unpacking all of the things that would've had to happen for this to come back. And it's like thousands of person hours at a minimum, because any feature change at that scale of organization, it's involving like a dozen people. Engineering, QA, analytics teams, project managers, user research and stuff like that. The problem with that, so I think it was a bad idea, right? But the problem with that was the difference that you could possibly achieve between having this feature and not having this feature is like this much whatever units you want. The cost of doing the analysis was this much. So it's guaranteed to be a loser.

(01:02:29):
Like there's just, there's no world in which anyone could imagine putting the at previous respondent in the thread at the beginning of the message could possibly make that much of a difference to the quality of Slack, and how much utility it provides for people and all of that. But you know that to put the feature flags in, to ship new versions of the product, to put the instrumentation in. To have it all the API calls to record every action that people take to do all the analytics, to create the dashboard. To put paste a screenshot of that into a Google Slides presentation. To send the invitations to the meeting, to reschedule the meeting because someone couldn't make it. To have everyone sit down and look at the thing. Like guaranteed loser.

(01:03:14):
And I know that Fareed told you to ask me about this hyper realistic work-like activities. And so here's my grand theory. Hyper realistic work-like activities goes along with this other concept called known valuable work to do. And when I say known, I mean both you know what it is and you know that it's valuable. And the problem with almost every organization at the very beginning, you have an enormous amount of work that you know what to do, and you know that it's going to be valuable. So like starting a business, open a bank account. Because there's almost infinite general value of opening a bank account. You have to do it. It's very simple to do.

(01:04:01):
And so at the very beginning of any startup, they're like, "I'm creating a user's table, and I'm doing sorting passwords," and you're doing all the things that are kind of absolutely necessary. And everyone knows exactly what they are. And so everyone's going to work in the morning and they're like right on. And I have 10 things to do, and every single one of them is something I know how to do. And it's definitely going to be valuable. Time goes on. And the relationship between the supply of work to do and the demand for doing work just starts to change.

(01:04:32):
More and more people get hired. Every product manager wants to hire a junior product manager. Every new person, the first person you bring in on the risk and compliance team is like, "Oh my God, there's so many risks and things we have to be compliant with. We better hire more people on my team to do more risk and compliance work." Which probably to some degree is right. But we're going to have more and more of those people and they're going to call meetings with each other.

(01:04:54):
And now suddenly you have all these people with work to do and you've done all the easy obvious stuff. And now your questions are like, "God, should we do FedRAMP high and make a Slack version? Which is going to require us to have wholly separate physical infrastructure for the hardware that runs the software? And also a whole different operations team, which has only US citizens on it? What is the possible number of dollars that we could make from doing this? And how much complexity is going to be when we want to do updates to the software because we update two totally separate independent systems and rec."

(01:05:27):
It just gets out of whack, and so people end up... Like if you hire 17 product marketers, you're going to have 17 product marketers worth of demand for work to do. And if you don't have sufficient supply of product marketing work to do, they're just going to do other stuff. Again, very important, not because they're stupid, not because they're evil. But because they're like, I'm a product marketer and I want to be recognized for my work. And my spouse has criticized me because they take, I should have already got promoted in the last cycle, and they really got to demonstrate some wins here and whatever it is.

(01:06:02):
And so people are like calling meetings with their colleagues to preview the deck that they're going to show in the big meeting to get feedback on whether they should improve some of the slides. And that hyper-realistic work-like activity is superficially identical to work. Like we are sitting in a conference room and there's something being projected up there, and we're all talking about it. And that's exactly what work is. Hopefully not all of work for everyone inside of your company. But that's exactly what we do when we're working.

(01:06:34):
But this is actually a fake bit of work, and it's so subtle that I'll do it. Our board members will do it. Every executive will do it. And the further you are from having all of the context and all of the information and the decision-making authority and stuff like that, the easier it is to get trapped in this stuff. And people will just perform enormous amounts of hyper-realistic work-like activities, and have no idea that that's what they're doing. And the result of that, I guess, is that if you are a leader, if you're manager, director, an executive, you're the CEO, it's on you to ensure that there is sufficient supply of known valuable work to do. And there almost always is, but it's creating the clarity around that. Creating the alignment. Making sure everyone understands it, but that's what they're supposed to be doing, and then obviously doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):
Amazing. I could listen to Stewart's rants all day. Hyper- realistic work-life activities. We need to coin this-

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:34):
Unfortunately, it doesn't make a good acronym. It's pretty ugly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):
Okay.

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:37):
[inaudible 01:07:37].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:36):
Okay. [inaudible 01:07:37] it a try. And just to close the loop on that, the solution is the leader recognizing this is happening and stopping it. Telling people why are we spending time on this thing that is not going to get us anywhere?

Stewart Butterfield (01:07:48):
Yeah. And what you just said probably isn't the best way because that sounds like you're chiding them, and they're dumb. When it's actually your responsibility to make sure that there's sufficient clarity around what the priorities are, and explicitly saying no to things upfront and stuff like that. Rather than merging and say like, "Hey, you guys are a bunch of idiots wasting your time on this thing that doesn't matter." Whose fault is it? It's the manager's fault. It's the VP of whatever's fault. It's the CX, whatever, it's the C... Ultimately, it's the leader of the organization that has the responsibility to make sure that there is sufficient known-valuable work to do. And that's actually harder than it might appear.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):
Okay. Before we run out of time, I want to touch on two other topics. One is, when people think of Stewart Butterfield, I think a lot of people think of, We Don't Sell Saddles Here. Your legendary Medium post that is just, I don't know, it's become a historic piece of literature in the annals of product building and in startups. I haven't heard people ask you much about this recently. So let me just ask a couple of questions. What was the reason you put that out? What was the backstory on writing that memo? Why was it necessary?

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:01):
Well, it really was an internal memo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):
... Memo. Why was it necessary?

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:01):
Well, it really was an internal memo and there's a bit of a digression. One of the crappy things about Slack is if all your corporate communication is on email, depending on exactly how it works and what system you use, you probably walk away with an archive of everything you said at Company X. If it's Slack, once you're turned off, you lose access to all that history. And so it's kind of like, "Oh, man. If I had only exported all of my messages before I left, I would have all this stuff," but that was absolutely verbatim. I did not change a word of what I said inside the company. Well, I think we were still eight people. Maybe at most 10, but I think it was eight people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:45):
It was before Slack launched even.

Stewart Butterfield (01:09:47):
Yeah, it was before Slack launched. It was when we're doing private beta. And the point of it was to start to instill those ideas as early as possible and really create this alignment inside of that small team so that it could persist to survive as we grew and scaled. Yeah, that was the idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):
And the gist, just for people that aren't super familiar with it, but we'll link to it, is just it's not enough just to build a great product. You just as much have to put effort into communicating what this does for them, the problem this is solving for them, the outcome this is going to achieve for them. Is that a good way to think about it?

Stewart Butterfield (01:10:28):
Yeah. And again, comparing it to beer or cars, beer goes back to pre-civilization. Cars were obviously [inaudible 01:10:38], but at some point you had to convince people why they would want a car instead of a horse. For your new AI-based recruiting tool or your calendar app or whatever, there's some reason why you think that people should use yours instead of the thing that they're using now, which might be a wholesale one-for- one replacement, or more often is a change in the way that you're working that has a bunch of other adjacencies and you want to expand into these other categories. You're not just responsible for creating the product, but also, to a certain degree, creating the market.

(01:11:15):
There's this book, Positioning, which is an absolute classic. It's very short. I would recommend everyone read it, where the point of it is, from my perspective, it's almost impossible to create a new idea in someone's head. It's much easier to take a couple of existing ideas and put them together. So it's much easier to say it's like Jaws meets Star Wars, or it's Uber for Pets or something like that, than to come up with an actual new idea. But you have to do that because if your thing is different in any significant way from the alternatives, you're not just creating the product. You're creating the market. They're really kind of one and the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:56):
The reason I wanted to touch on it is I think still people continue to not listen to this advice and continue to over-invest in more features, more products, things like that. Just the specific example of, "We don't sell saddles here," just to quickly communicate this to folks, and correct me if I'm missing anything, is just instead of, "Hey, look at this amazing saddle we've bought," which you want to communicate as, "Here, go horseback riding. Look at this incredible experience you can have." And then they decide, "Oh, shit. I need to go buy a saddle to do that."

Stewart Butterfield (01:12:23):
Yeah. And 100%, that aspect of it is not original because I think that's something that marketers have done for a long time, certainly in the marcom and advertising. If you want to sell Harley-Davidson's, there are people who are going to geek out on the engines and stuff like that and the quality of the leather and stuff like that. But when you're selling the motorcycle, you're selling the open road and freedom and the wind in your hair. And if you're Lululemon, you are obviously selling yoga pants, but you're also selling health and aspiration and being the best version of yourself and a bunch of other stuff. Oh my God, I forgot the classic version of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:00):
There's the ship ...

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:00):
You're selling the screwdriver.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:04):
Oh, yeah. The nail.

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:05):
Yeah, the nail. Anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:07):
Yeah, we missed that one. Well, there's the one I think about is instead of trying to convince men to build a ship, instill a yearning for the sea.

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:16):
Yes. Exactly. That's something that goes back in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):
Okay. Let me ask you about pivoting. You are potentially the king of pivots. You started two companies both famously pivoted, both from video games, which is why I asked you about that at the beginning, into very successful companies. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting. Let me just ask when folks come to you asking, "Should I stick with my idea? Should I pivot?" what sort of advice do you find most helps them?

Stewart Butterfield (01:13:43):
Yeah, I mean, I think it's partly an intuition because obviously the decision is about, "Have you exhausted the possibilities?" and in the case where we were working on Glitch, this game where we used IRC for internal communication and we added a bunch of IRC which became the Proto Slack. I think Slack had an enormous advantage in the fact that we are working on this for several years without actually explicitly working on it and only doing the minimum number of features that were absolutely guaranteed to be successful in the sense that it was so irritating that we couldn't stand it anymore or such an obvious improvement that we couldn't help but take advantage of it. We still had $ 9 million left and everyone still liked the game and we were all happy working on it, but I think by that point I had exhausted every non-verdiculous long shot idea to make it commercially successful, and so I decided to abandon it.

(01:14:52):
But the default advice for anyone in anything is persevere. It's like a kitten hanging off the branch and a poster says, "Hang in there." There's so many stories of, "So-and-so started out going door-to-door and was rejected by everyone and then suddenly there was Nike," or something like that and just, "If you stick with it long enough, you'll eventually be successful." I think you have to really be coldly rational. Some of this shows up in the book Thinking in Bets. Some of it's in Annie Duke's second book, the title of which I'm forgetting right now, but someone will know it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):
Yeah, Thinking in Bets, and then what was the second? I forget.

Stewart Butterfield (01:15:39):
She actually uses Glitch and Slack as an example of a smart fold basically. My expected value here has diminished to the point where this alternative looks more attractive. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating. I convinced so many and you have to convince so many people to get a company off the ground. You have to go to investors. You have to go to early employees and say, "You should leave your other job and come work for this because here's the incredible feature we're imagining." You have to go to the press and you have to make all these promises and you have users and you've committed things to the users and you've convinced them to give up their time for this thing. And so I think for a lot of people, it feels better to just keep doing it until it dies of suffocation due to lack of capital or something like that. Then just to admit, "Okay, I was wrong. This didn't work," and it's humiliating. It's painful. It's wrenching. It has a bad impact.

(01:16:46):
When we shut down Glitch, there was a lot of people who loved it and would spend all of their free time and couldn't wait to get home from work to go play it more. And that was their community and the community just disappeared, all these people and all these identities that have been created. And obviously, people lost their jobs and people who had moved their families to a different city in order to take this job now weren't going to have a job anymore. So pivots aren't something I take lightly. I think it's very different to be like, "There's three of us and we started making this app and then we pivoted to a different app." That doesn't even really count. If you're six months into something, you're still messing around. You're trying to figure out what it is that you're building. It's not really a pivot. Obviously in this case, it worked out great and there's survivorship bias and that doesn't mean that everyone should pivot all the time. But I think creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual, rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):
I love, also, your piece of advice of just exhaust. Once you've exhausted all the ideas, that's a really good time to see what else is out there.

Stewart Butterfield (01:17:56):
Yeah, just all the good ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
All the good ideas,

Stewart Butterfield (01:18:00):
All the realistic. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Yeah. The point you made about just kind of persevering, I just had Melanie Perkins, CEO of Canva, in the podcast. 100 investors rejected her before somebody finally decided to invest and she just kept pushing.

Stewart Butterfield (01:18:19):
Yeah. I think that's a slightly different example, right? She eventually believed in the concept of the product and in the vision. It was just trying to figure out the right articulation to get investors who ended up being obviously very, very happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):
Extremely happy. Oh, geez. Okay. Maybe a final topic depending on how time goes. I want to talk about generosity. I talked to a bunch of people, as I said, that have worked with you and the number one theme that came up again and again and again when I asked them about you and what has stuck most with them is just generosity. So I'm going to read a few examples that I heard from folks that are examples of your generosity over the years.

(01:18:57):
So one person shared that he needed a little money before Christmas and he said, "Stewart literally walked me out of the building, went to the cash machine, handed me $500, told me to go home to my family." Other folks shared that, when you talked about Glitch just recently when you had to lay people off, you cried real tears when you were laying people off and then you spent an incredible amount of time helping them find new jobs and extending their severance pay and just taking it extremely, extremely seriously, much more than I think most people feel like CEOs do. Someone else shared that you paid 100% of employees health insurance to give them just fewer things to think about.

(01:19:35):
When you went public, you basically created the best possible situation for employees, no lockup, direct listing. Also, with the structure of the Slack deal, people said that acquisition was very employee friendly. That's employees. There's also just the way you thought about customers. A few examples: You gave free credits to businesses who were struggling to pay the bills during COVID. You released this fair billing, which I think was very innovative at the time, where you stopped charging people for seats they weren't using, even though they signed a deal to charge for those seats. A lot of times, you slipped release schedules because you just wanted to make features better and better for people. And I'll end with this quote: "Stewart is a leader who takes the responsibility he feels for his employees personally, and to which he extends the most generous circumstances he could muster. That feels worth celebrating."

(01:20:25):
So first of all, I just want to celebrate you. I think it's really rare and inspiring to meet a leader like that. Clearly, you've had a lot of impact on a lot of people. I don't know exactly the question I want to ask, but I guess in what part is this intentional, just like, "This is how we win. I'm going to be very generous and help people because I know this will help long-term"? How much of this is just a [inaudible 01:20:48] and it's just the way you are as a person?

Stewart Butterfield (01:20:49):
I think a lot of it is just the way I am as a person and I had wonderful parents who raised me right, but I think there is a little bit of a lesson there and I'm just going to assume people's familiarity with the prisoner's dilemma. The acts of generosity to me are, "Oh, I am demonstrating that I am going to cooperate as we iterate in this game." And if you do that, then people will also cooperate and you both benefit. Whereas if you never really know if the other person is going to defect at the first opportunity, then your best bet is to defect. And so there's a game theoretic aspect, usually in games that are much, much, much more complicated than the prisoner's dilemma.

(01:21:36):
I think one thing I didn't touch on before, but to me was important enough, is that at more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. It was, "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers." And I wanted to be super clear and explicit about that because it should be if anything you're doing feels like a little bit shady, a little bit cheating, a little bit maximizing at the wrong moment or taking advantage of a customer or anything like that, definitely shouldn't do it. Because to me, I mean I think it's literally true, but it's also an ethical way to run a business. And it's not just that the ethics are good. It's like there's advantages for you. You're able to attract a better class of employees. If all your employees are ethical, then it's going to be a better place for everyone to work and you're going to be happier and you're going to have fewer internal problems and all that stuff.

(01:22:48):
But I think it really is true that especially in the long run, you can't destroy value for your customers and expect to be successful. You have to actually make their lives better. And you could put effort into pointing it out to them and demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it. And I think that is incredibly important and that implies a real generosity, whether that's in negotiating terms with an enterprise deal or that's policy decisions. One time that it blew up in our face was our SLA was like, "For any downtime, you get 100 times your money back." Because from my perspective, it's like if we're down for two minutes, it's like pennies. It doesn't really make any difference. If we're down for 10 hours or something like that, then we have bigger problems than paying back people.

(01:23:51):
Fast-forward, we now have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and we've gone public. And shortly after we go public, we have one of the biggest outages we ever had. I don't remember how long it was, but it was many hours. But by the time we got that scale, 100 times the money back for the third of a day that we were down was $8 million or something like that. It didn't cost us any money because we just gave it to people in the form of credits, but it meant that a bunch of revenue that we had already anticipated for the next quarter wasn't going to show up because people's credits were going to offset what they would've otherwise paid us. And so we definitely changed the terms of service after that because being a public company is a little bit different. But in every other respect, I think they were all really important decisions that were helpful in us becoming successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):
Was that policy ... It was automatic? You didn't even have to claim it. It was just automatically you get this credit?

Stewart Butterfield (01:24:52):
And the default is you don't have to pay if you let us know. This was, "We will automatically, proactively, preemptively without any input from you ..."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:00):
Too generous.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:01):
"Apply this credit to your account, and just send you a message that it happened. And by the way, we will do it on the aggregate for downtime, even if the issue didn't affect you as a customer."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:13):
Wow. Too generous. You found the edge of where you want to be.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:18):
What was that mantra again that you had the company chant? I think this is a really nice way to end it.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:22):
It was, "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value we create for customers."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:28):
Incredible. I'm just trying to picture the entire team at Slack reciting this mantra.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:33):
It was hundreds of people. It felt very like, Kim Jong-Un or Stalin or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:38):
Well, on that note, most people don't know this about you, but your actual name when you were born was not Stewart. It was Dharma.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:46):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
And this all makes sense as you learn that.

Stewart Butterfield (01:25:49):
Yeah. My name is Dharma Jeremy Butterfield, so my parents named me. And when I was 12, I changed it because I just really wanted to be normal and for some reason I thought Stewart was a normal name. And by the way, you'll notice this now that I said it. Any character except for Stuart Little the mouse, anytime you see a character in a movie, a novel, TV show or whatever, there's only the loser Stewart and the asshole Stewart. It's obviously, in the collective consciousness, a terrible name and I shouldn't have chosen it and I regret it. But by the time I realized that, Dharma and Greg had already come out and it would've seemed like I was bandwagon jumping. And people thought it was a girl's name, even though in India it's obviously only a boy's name.

(01:26:32):
I'm going to add just one last little tidbit because I forgot about this earlier on and I think it helps tie things together, and it's called the owner's delusion. And this is based on something I posted on Twitter. The person who came up with the name later deleted their account and so I have no idea who it was and who to credit for this. But what I had posted was, and this was a long time ago when restaurant websites have gotten better and it doesn't really matter because Google Local was taking over everything, but this is, let's say, 10 years ago.

(01:27:00):
There's five things you could possibly want when you go to a restaurant's website and it's their street address, their phone number, the menu, the hours of operation ... Oh my God, I'm forgetting the fifth thing. Oh, and making a reservation, how to make a reservation. And again, this problem has to some extent taken care of it's itself or at least improved, but what you would get was this super slow loading photo, the Ken Burns effect as it [inaudible 01:27:30] ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):
The flashed.

Stewart Butterfield (01:27:30):
And then fading in and then some music starts playing. And then if they show you the phone number, it's not clickable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:38):
Image.

Stewart Butterfield (01:27:39):
It's not even text that you can copy because yes, it's an image. And they don't have the hours. They don't put the address or whatever and it's just like, "What?" For sure, whoever made this website for the restaurant owner and the restaurant owner themselves have definitely been in the position where they went to somebody else's restaurant website because they wanted to get the address or the opening hours or the phone number or whatever. So why does it end up like this and what should we call this?

(01:28:01):
And whoever replied to the tweet, she said, "We should call it the owner's delusion," and I was like, "Oh my God. That's perfect." And I think that is incredibly powerful and what ends up with the result, like Apple naming whatever that feature is called Sleep, which it's too hard to understand what that can possibly mean. And that's why people anticipate, despite the fact that when they get to your website for the first time, their intent is absolutely the minimum number of micro points above the threshold required from them to actually take that action.

(01:28:41):
You're like, "All right. Welcome to my website," and there's a bunch of BS and there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense and the buttons are inscrutable. And it's unclear what to do next because I think that my thing is so important and I don't recognize that you are at work and you were late this morning and you have to go to the bathroom and you're just a regular human being who has stuff going on, that you're concerned that your kid is a fuck-up and they're getting in trouble at school and stuff like that. They're not subjects who paid money to go to your play and are sitting in the audience and waiting for that curtain to go out. They're people who are going to bounce in a fraction of a second. And so everyone should always be conscious of the owner's solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:27):
I love that. What's the solution? Is it have other people look at it and give you feedback?

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:31):
Yeah, and recognize it. And unfortunately, it's one of those things like Murphy's Law.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:35):
Yeah.

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:37):
Even you can go wrong even when you take into account Murphy's Law.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:39):
That's right.

Stewart Butterfield (01:29:41):
But if you don't name it and recognize it and discuss it and train yourself to think that way, take a breath, pretend you're a regular person, and then look at this again and see if it makes sense, then you're screwed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:55):
I love that. I love that you threw this in here. I have a billion other questions I'm going to ask you in part two when we do this someday. Stewart, thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for being here.

Stewart Butterfield (01:30:04):

# Lessons in product leadership and AI strategy from Glean, Google, Amazon, and Slack | Tamar Yehoshua

## Transcript

Tamar Yehoshua (00:00:00):
Make sure you go somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. Because if you have great ideas of what to build but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned. You don't want any of this ... Like people in the organization, they ask mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other. That doesn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Today, my guest is Tamar Yehoshua. Tamar is currently president of product and technology at Glean, one of the most successful enterprise AI companies out there right now. Prior to joining Glean, Tamar was chief product officer at Slack for four years where she led product design and research as the company scaled 10Xed their revenue, went through IPO and then got bought by Salesforce. Tamar also led product and engineering teams at Google, where for many years she was responsible for the Google search experience. She also spent five years at Amazon as director of engineering and vice president at A9.com. She was also a venture partner at IVP and has been on board of directors for ServiceNow, Snyk, RetailMeNot, and Yext. In our conversation, we get into all kinds of juicy advice, including why companies don't have to be run well to win, why you don't need a career plan, the two habits she credits most for helping her succeed throughout her career, what she learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield and Marc Benioff, how to build stronger cross-functional relationships and a bunch of advice on AI including how it will likely change your jobs, examples of how she and her colleagues are already using AI to be more productive in their work and what she's learned about building AI-based products that are non-deterministic and can be very unpredictable.

(00:01:51):
This episode is for anyone looking to level up as a leader and get a better sense of how AI will change your job. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Tamar Yehoshua.

(00:02:12):
Tamar, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:02:15):
Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:17):
I've had so many people recommend you coming on this podcast. I'm really happy that we're finally doing this. I want to start with a question that I've started to ask people who have had extraordinarily successful careers, which you've had. So let me ask you, what are one or two specific skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success during the course of your career that you think might be helpful to people who are trying to figure out how to accelerate their career or just be more successful in their career?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:02:47):
One of the things that I think is overlooked is do a really good job at whatever your job is at that point. People have a tendency ... Especially product managers are very ambitious and they want to get to the next level and they're always eyeing the next job, but you're not going to get the next job unless you do really well at the job that you're in. Knock it out of the park. However simple, however easy it may be to you, do a great job. And in tech jobs, there's table stakes. There's table stakes of you need to be technical, you need to know the latest technology, you need to understand your product, the product you're working on. No matter what your role is. You have to understand it deeply. You need to understand metrics. So especially product managers have a wide breadth of things that they need to understand. So those are a given. You need to do that.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:05:55):
So now the question is the difference in leadership and executive roles and when you're getting there. So how do you start transitioning? So after you've done a great job at everything and you understand the core skills that you need, another thing you really need to know is understanding people and motivations. And when you're building products, you have to understand why does somebody want to use your product? What problem are they solving? Why do they want to click on that button? What's going to make them feel good when they click on it? What's going to give them delight and what's also going to make them feel bad and frustrated and what do they not want to do? So you need to understand motivations in people for building products and for building teams and organizations. So just like why does somebody want to click on a button, why does somebody want to join your team? Why do they want to work hard? What are they trying to accomplish? What's the goal for their career?

(00:06:54):
So you have to be able to read people, ask lots of questions to understand them. And I'll say one thing that really helped me, this is a strange segue, but my father was a psychiatrist and when I was growing up, we would have family occasions, go to events, whatever, and afterwards in the car ride back, he would always give his perspective of analyzing what happened at the event. What this person was thinking. Why did they say this? And then he would quiz me of, "Why do you think they did that?" And it was really interesting because it taught me to see the whole room. To see how people react. Like Lenny, if you say something and somebody else is there, look at the other person. What's their face saying? You can understand so much if you're paying attention. So I think when you want to build for people and lead organizations, it is about the people and understanding them and motivating them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):
I love this advice. I feel like we could do a whole podcast on just this topic. So on this last point about understanding people, is there an example of this in either a product you built of just like, "Oh, here's something I noticed about someone using Slack or Google or Amazon that changed the way I think about building this specific feature."?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:08:17):
One of the things that I caution product managers about is that you don't want to be too overly reliant on metrics and you want to also have an intuition. You want product managers who understand intuitively their customers and their product and sometimes you'll make decisions because you just know it's the right thing to do because it feels right and it usually is right if you understand your product well enough. How do you get good at it? Ask a lot of questions. Don't assume you know. Marc Benioff would always say, "Have a beginner's mind. Go in assuming that you know nothing and listen to your customers, listen to the people." Because I also see this as you're building a feature and you think it's the best thing. Because of course everyone's going to want it because you worked on it and you're going to put it front and center in the interface where everybody's going to see it. Well, no, you got to earn that right. And that is another thing that people do is they want the thing they worked on to be right there, but it might not be the most important thing that a person needs at that point. So have perspective. Have perspective of what your users are actually trying to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):
Going back to your first point about doing a great job at the job you have, I imagine some people hear this and the advice is do a great job at the job you're already doing, and they may feel like they are, and there's other reasons they aren't being promoted. Is there an example from your career or a story you could tell of just like to clarify what doing a great job look like where it's not just like I hit my goals. It's like, here's what it looks like. Here's how you actually get ahead.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:10:00):
Are you helping the business move forward? So it's not about I achieve what I was asked to do, but did you build something that people actually used? It's not about just launching something and did you do the right thing for the company? And that is different. It's a different mindset. Did you enable the entire organization to be more productive despite you? I remember very early in my career I was working as an engineer and I was offered a job to manage a team that was across different programs. I took a vacation, I came back and I said, "I don't think this team should exist." It was my first management job and I wanted to be a manager. And I said, "Here's why I don't think that this team should exist. It's not the right thing for the company. It's not going to be productive." And my manager was so stunned. He was like, "Wait. You're saying no?" I'm like, "Yeah, because here's how you should organize it." And then he's like, "You're right, and I'll find you something else," and he did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
If I were to put this into one word, it's impact. Drive impact.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:11:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
Amazing. Okay. Going in a different direction, we were chatting before we started recording this and something that you shared with me, and some people may be really surprised to hear this, but I completely agree with this take, is that you don't need to be a well-run business to win. I've seen this myself. I'd love to hear your insights here and especially where you notice this. What parts of your career noticed this to be true?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:11:45):
I love working at well-run companies. It's more fun, your people are happier. I like running a well-run team, so I aspire to have a very well run team and to work at a well run company. But what I've seen is when a company isn't well run like IT isn't working, marketing is broken, there are not enough people in HR, there's a lot of turnover. All of these things I've seen that they're not correlated to the company being successful. So I can think of a couple examples right now of companies I know ... Not Glean, where I'm working today. Where there's high executive turnover. Where people get yelled at. There are lots of people fired. There's reorgs all the time. People I talk to are super unhappy, but the numbers are amazing. They're growing like crazy. And the opposite sit is also true. I can think of one company I know really well, amazing, CEO, well run, well oiled machine, everything. Hired good executives and they flat lined.

(00:12:51):
So you just see it. You see it over and over again and people get very upset about these things that aren't working. And one of the things that I try and do is give a perspective of what matters and what doesn't. And it might even be to the sales team because you get all these requests for features all the time. If you did every single one, it would be impossible. Even if you did, 80, 90% of them won't matter for the success of the company. But then there are some that really matter. So what are the things that really matter? We always talk about product market fit. Nobody really knows what product market fit is. Everybody has a different explanation, but it means people want to use your product. That they're clamoring for it. So you've built something that people value and that people value and that solves a problem for them, but that's also not good enough. You need to build a great product, but you also have to have distribution and you need to have a sales team that works. And you have to have enough money in the bank to get there. So those are probably the things that are the most important. I might be missing something.

(00:13:58):
And then within each of those, there's the things that really mattered and there's so many features that we built at Slack that were the most important features ever that failed and nobody used so it clearly didn't have an impact. And you can see that in retrospect, but I think after being at multiple different big companies and small companies, I have that perspective of let's just make sure that we do the right things and don't get too worked up about all the things that are broken because every startup has so many things that are broken.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:29):
So I think a really interesting insight here is that if you're working at a company that is just chaotic and it feels like we don't know what we're doing, I don't know how this thing is running, I don't know how this will continue to be successful, your experience is it ... Is it that most of the successful companies you've been at are just chaotic internally and aren't incredibly run and that's normal, that's very typical?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:14:51):
Until they get to a certain scale. Now, once you reach a certain scale and you've already conquered the market, then you need to be well run. Then you bring in professional managers and things are about the cost and executing and getting all the ... Once you get to over 5,000 people or 10,000 people, you got to have things that ... Then you're a growth engine. You have to know what phase you're in and what's important at that phase. So it isn't that at every phase, chaos is okay, and also some chaos is okay and some chaos is not okay. If you're changing your strategy all the time and you're changing your direction and you're changing projects on people all the time so that they can't actually achieve anything ... So this is again, so you can't simplify it that some chaos is okay and some isn't. And also some chaos is right for you as a person. There are some really great companies I would never work at because they don't fit me. They're not a company I would enjoy going to work in the morning or they're not aligned with what I'm good at. So just because a company is doing well, if the chaos is chaos and something that's going to make you upset and unhappy don't work there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):
Is there a correlation there? Just like companies that have strong product market fit, things are just breaking as they're going through hyper growth? Just thoughts on why this is the case.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:16:21):
A lot of it is that because if you are in hyper growth, you've got customers coming at a really fast pace, you're growing your company really quickly and the number of employees and it's just really hard to keep up. Because things in the infrastructure break, things in the communication breakdown. You've got at any given point 50% of the company has been there less than six months. But you have to grow really fast because once you hit product market fit, if you don't, then your growth will stop. So if you're suddenly growing, especially if you're an enterprise company, you have to have salespeople, if you're a consumer company or systems have to keep running as you scale. And look at companies like MySpace, well, they died because their product got too slow. And so some companies have initial product market fit and then they don't keep up. So I do think a lot of it is it's very hard to grow that fast. And so things really do start breaking, but then once you get all the right leadership in place, processes in place, then it starts to get better. So it goes through ups and downs in level of chaos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:28):
There's one takeaway here that product market fit solves a lot of problems. Strong product market fit.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:17:33):
Well, no product market fit is a death sentence. I would say it more like that. If you built a product that people aren't really excited to use, then you don't have a company because it's very hard to do that unless you have distribution machine and then you catch up over time. But we will not name companies like that. So there are other ways of doing it, but yeah, that is the most important thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:00):
Yeah. I will say during my experience at Airbnb, I absolutely saw this. It was just nonstop chaos. And I always felt like, well, how is this continuing to operate and succeed? Things are just out of control. Everything's changing every six months. I don't know what's happening here. And I think a lesson here is just that's normal for a hyper growth business that has strong product market fit. But again, not a good excuse to just allow chaos. And it's not like chaos means success, right?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:18:30):
And it's not a good excuse to not have an organization that's functioning. You should still strive to have an organization that's functioning and keep people happy and motivated and all that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):
Great. Okay. Another maybe contrarian opinion that you hold along the career track is that you don't need to plan your career. I also 100% agree with this. I had no plan for my career. I never knew where the hell I was going to go. I never had this vision of here's what I want to do. I just followed things that were pulling me and things that seemed interesting. I love that you also tell people this. I'd love to hear your insights here. Especially for someone that's either struggling with their career or just stressed. They don't have a plan or their plan's not working the way they wanted it to.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:19:12):
Really recently I was talking to somebody in their twenties who was asking me for career advice. Should I be a product manager, et cetera. And I'm trying to put together my five-year plan and I said, "I never had a five-year plan." So to be clear, some people need that. That's the kind of people they are. They want the planning. I said, "It's great if you want that, but I never had it." And the person I was talking to just relaxed and they're like, "Oh my God, that's so great to hear because I have no idea what I want to do in five years." I'm like, "I still have no idea what I want to do in five years. I've never had an idea what I want to do in five years." Early in your career you have a lot more angst about it because the forks in the road are more significant because they can go, do I go get an MBA or do I go work for somebody? Do I be a product manager or an engineer? And those really take you in very different paths.

(00:20:09):
And I meet a lot of kids in their ... I shouldn't call them kids. My kids are my kids' friends. But a lot of people who are younger in their career who are struggling with this a little bit. So what I believe, and I've always believed is that you follow people. You learn the most from people. I don't look for domains. Some people have a domain, like I'm super interested in climate or whatever and they really want to work in that area and that's fine so maybe within that area. But you follow people who are the best at what they do. So it's not good enough to follow somebody who you like. You want to follow somebody who's either the best product thinker or the best engineer or the best salesperson. And so that you will learn the skill of how to be the best at that.

(00:21:01):
So you follow people where you're going to learn the most. And a way to do that also is you look at where the great people are going. So you want to go to companies where there's also a nexus of great people because they together will do great things. And even if the company fails or succeeds, but not as much as you'd like, you still have those connections. Everybody talks about the PayPal Mafia and how they've gone on to do things. I was super lucky to be at Google for so many years and I spent a lot of time with Googlers that I met and that are all working in different companies now because you build those relationships by working together. So if you follow people and where you're going to learn the most and you go step by step, I think that's a great way of progressing in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:53):
That's such tactical advice. And I've seen this work for a lot of people that just go where their favorite former employees work. And not favorite to your point, but the people that they most respect and have been most impressed by. And I think it's such an easy thing to do. It's a really easy heuristic for understanding where to go. There's something Marc Andreessen once shared that I'm reminded of when you say this. There's a term for this, I forget the actual term, but there's certain companies have this gravitational pull where they are acquiring all the best talent. They're currently the gravity in the space and everyone awesome is going there. And you have to, as a company, know you're one of those companies or you're the opposite. You're losing all the people and they're all going to this other company. I guess any thoughts on that?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:22:43):
Yeah. And it's really bad when you don't have a gravitational pull. It's super hard. I would say that one thing that if you're a manager, I always advise managers, go somewhere where you can recruit. I got a piece of advice from a friend that I thought was amazing advice as a leader. She said to me, "Take a job where if you hire people, it's going to make their careers." I was like, "Whoa." Because I was getting offers for some turnaround jobs. And if you think you can turn around, great. But if you're going to hire the best people, you want to make sure that it's going to be a good place for them and that they're going to learn and they're going to grow. And so you want to do right by them. And you really earnestly want to say you can make your career by coming here.

(00:23:36):
And I thought that gave such a higher bar for every job I was looking at as a leader that I thought it was just amazing advice. And then on the flip side, on the negative side, some people are putting too much emphasis on where will I get a big financial return? And I've found that financial returns are the hardest to predict. You know who's good. You know who you want to work with. You can predict where you're going to learn. Because even if a company fails, you learn a lot. But predicting financial success is so hard because you don't know what's going to happen with the market, with the world, with crypto, and Meta AI. And people who do that and say ... I had one person say, "I took this job because I'm a mercenary. They just paid me a ton." Did not work out for him. And I feel really bad when people do that, but I think that it's a dangerous thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
I imagine some people hearing this advice are going to feel like, "I'm not going to get a job at OpenAI or Glean or other awesome companies that everyone wants to go work at." Any advice to those folks?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:24:52):
There's lots of good companies and there's lots of smart people. You don't have to be at the top brand. And if you go somewhere where you're going to learn and it's going to get you there. I made mistakes. I went to some companies, multiple companies that failed or stopped growing and didn't do well or didn't have all the right people. Careers you don't make every step is to the right place. You remember in what you cited, all the companies I went to that did well, you left out all the ones that I went to that didn't do well. And so then people will assume that every time I made a job change, it was to a company that did well. No. That was not the case. So if you focus on that learning bit, you will get there. And there are lots of paths. There isn't just the OpenAI or Glean or Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):
Awesome. And again, I love how tactical this is. If someone is trying to figure out where to go work if they're unhappy in their current job or don't have a job right now is just make a list of the people you most respect that are the best at the thing they do, see where they work and there's your list of companies to potentially go after. There's a lot of benefits to this as you shared. It's not just helping you pick the place to work, it's the network. It'll level you up. Is there anything else along those lines that is helpful for people to think about why this is a really good strategy?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:26:10):
Skills can't be taken away. A company can fail, but if you learn a skill, you will always have that skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):
I love that. And I've totally seen this to work, so I really love that you're focusing on this advice. You've mentioned places you've worked and folks you've worked with. You worked with folks like Jeff Bezos, Stewart Butterfield, some of the top product thinkers, leaders in the world. So let me just ask, what's one thing you learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:26:37):
Probably can't narrow it down to one, but I'll talk about Bezos first. I was very lucky to join Amazon early when I still ... I had quarterly meetings with Jeff Bezos. And this was before AWS launched, so it was before Amazon was known in the Valley. This is another example. I went there because I went to work for Udi Manbe who started A9 and he was talking to me one night trying to recruit me and he spent two hours on the phone with me telling me how amazing Jeff Bezos was. And this was before there were any books on him. And that really convinced me to go there. So there's a lot written on Bezos. Read his shareholder letters, read the books about him, read Colin Bryar's Working Backwards. The Everything Box I think it's called or The Everything Store.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):
The Everything Store. Yeah.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:27:27):
There's so many good books and there's so much to learn about how he works. So I won't try and cover those things. The things that stood out to me from the meetings I had with him were a couple of things. One, a lot of people have written about these six pagers, so he doesn't believe in PowerPoint. You write a six pager about ... It's like studying for the final exam is writing these six pagers. So you go into the meeting and there's the people around the table, his executive team and him. First he does not speak until everybody around the table speaks. So he goes around to all his leads and said, "What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?" And I'm sitting there like, "I don't care what anyone think. I just want to hear what Bezos thinks." But he wants to make sure that it's a team effort and that he's listening to what everybody in his organization thinks.

(00:28:17):
And he always spoke last. He is by far the smartest person I've ever met in my life. I've worked with a lot of smart people. But his ability to go deep in any domain and nail the core issue, and remember. We would've quarterly meetings and from quarter to quarter he would remember things that he had talked about before and then he would go into the architecture of search and why are you doing it this way or that way? And you're just blown away that he knows that. For me, the biggest takeaway from those meetings was his consistency, which is he had principles that it made it easier for you to operate in his company because you knew what he cared about because he always had these principles. Everything had to be customer driven, everything had to be relevant for the customer.

(00:29:12):
He hated icons. That was just the thing. You had to write what they were because people couldn't figure out what they are. So anytime you showed an icon, he would get annoyed. But you would go in and after a couple of meetings you're like, "Okay. I know what he's going to ask about. I know how he's thinking and I know what his principles are." And I think that consistency enables you to operate a large organization more effectively. And then there's one other thing that I really remember was one of the few really small meetings I was in with him and we were presenting working on a new product, and I was like, "Our competitors have 10 times as many people as we do on this." And he looks at me and he said, "That is your advantage." And then he goes into his talk about how it's a hill and it takes seven years to build a product. You can't look at it in the near term. You have to be in it for the long term. You can be sure I never went in and said, "I need a lot more resources." So that was Bezos.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):
Awesome.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:30:17):
Stewart. Again, I went to Slack because I wanted to work with Stewart Butterfield. I think he is the best product thinker in the Valley. He's not working in product right now. He's taking time off. But he's got this combination of long-term thinking and in the details. So in 2014, he wrote a master plan for Slack, which was build a product people love, build a network. That's Slack Connect. Build a platform that makes all of your other SaaS products more valuable. That's Slack Platform. And then do some magic AI stuff. Magic AI stuff took a lot longer, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):
That was part of his plan early on is magic AI stuff.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:30:55):
It literally was. There was a grid with four boxes in 2014 and it never changed. That was his master plan and what we worked on each year changed. But somebody recently asked me, "You guys did Slack Connect much later?" I'm like, "Yeah, but it was always part of the plan." It was always part of his vision. So he saw forward in the vision, but he also was very much into the details. And I think the thing that I learned from him the most was the power of prototyping. And that even though he was such a great product thinker, he would always say, "I can't tell you if this is going to work. I have to feel it. I have to try it. And a mock-up doesn't tell you what it's going to feel like." And he would push people to do prototypes, not incremental of just to get a feature out, but really to think. Very soon after I started, we launched ... I hired a design lead, Ethan Eismannn, and he led a redesign of the new information architecture for Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:59):
I worked with Ethan at Airbnb.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:32:00):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):
He was head of design for the search experience and the search team.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:32:04):
Yeah. Ethan is awesome. And he came in and his first task was to work with Stewart on this redesign. And Stewart came in and said, "I want you to take everything in the interface and put it behind one button." And everyone's like, "That's never going to work." And he's like, "Do it. Just do it." And so we had our prototypers ... We had also engineers, front-end engineers who were really good at prototyping, literally took everything in the interface and put it behind one button and he said, "This is how you're going to see what you really need in the interface." So we were never going to ship that, but it was the beginning of the redesign.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:43):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers.

(00:33:52):
As a product leader, how do you think about just the time it takes to create a prototype in something like this? As a pm I'm just like a lot of times we don't have time to build this whole prototype. We got to ship stuff, we got to hit these calls, we got experiments to run, we'll just build it and see how it goes. How do you think about making time for something like that?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:34:08):
If you're doing it right, it'll be faster and you need to have an engineering infrastructure that enables prototyping. So some engineering infrastructures are too heavy and they don't actually enable prototyping. We had a problem with our mobile apps that it was too hard to prototype and we actually redesigned our mobile apps until we got to the point where it was easier because our desktop app was pretty easy to prototype. But you have to have a layer of abstraction that enables you to do that, and you have to have engineers who have a prototyping mindset, and if you build multiple things and you have this mindset as I'm willing to throw it away, you write code that is never going to make it to production so you can just crank it out much faster and then you can see what works and then you build the production code. Until you actually get to your end goal of something working faster.

(00:35:02):
But you need the engineering team to have the same mindset. The product and engineering have to work together and design because design is just in it. Sometimes you can get design engineers who are doing the prototyping. So your first prototypes are like Figma prototypes, and then you get prototypes on real data. When I was at Google, one of our teams, a front-end team, I remember we hired a bunch of prototypers and our head of front-end engineering said to me one day, this is my secret weapon. This is how we move faster. So I do think it's a mindset shift and a tech stack shift.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:39):
We're going to talk about AI later, but it's also getting easier to build prototypes with AI. There's this video recently that went around on Twitter where an eight-year-old girl was building an app and in like 45 minutes, she built a chatbot using this product called Cursor. So I think that'll unlock a lot of great product on opportunities and just accelerate this sort of work. I asked about Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield. I'm curious if there's another leader you've worked with that maybe is less known that you also learned a ton from that might be worth talking about.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:36:12):
I think that there are people who are really, really good at what they do. So Marc Benioff is an amazing marketeer. His marketing mind ... After the acquisition, I got the opportunity to onstage with him at Dreamforce for ... Because Slack was a new shiny thing so of course Slack was going to be in the keynote. And so I was in the Benioff's keynote two years in a row. And so I watched how he approaches his keynote and the whole thing around Dreamforce. Dreamforce is incredible at the impact that it has on the ecosystem. And so I think that as a product, people don't think of him as much, but as his marketing abilities are amazing what he's done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):
I've written posts about how various companies got started in Salesforce history. Always comes to mind where they go to conferences where's there's no software mascot walking around. And I remember they did something around one of their competitors where they just created some real controversy around someone.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:22):
Well, they went into their competitor's conference and stood outside their competitor's conference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
Mm-hmm. Right. That's what it was.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:29):
This is in the Beyond Software. This is in his book that he wrote about the early phases of Salesforce. And it takes his guts. He pushes the envelope.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
I love that. It's a really good point that people don't think of Marc Benioff as a marketer. And that's interesting that that's maybe the main thing you took away from him is just the power of marketing and the skill.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:49):
He approaches his marketing presentations like a product person approaches their building their product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):
Amazing. Okay. Speaking of former colleagues, I asked one of your former colleagues, his name is Fuzzy Khos. He's now the CTO of Notion. You worked with him, I believe at Slack.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:37:59):
And at Google.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):
And at Google. Wow. Okay. So I asked him what to ask you, and he said that you're amazing at building strong cross-functional relationships, especially with engineers. I know you used to be an engineer, so I get where that skill come from. What can you teach people about building stronger cross-functional relationships, especially PMs to build better relationships with their engineers, designers, other folks on their team?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:38:34):
Probably the most important thing that a product leader does because if you have great ideas of what to build, but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So one, make sure somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. So Henderson was the co-founder and CTO of Slack, and I couldn't have asked for a better engineering partner. He's just awesome. And that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join or you know that it's not the right one and the organization is willing to make a change. So that can happen too. You can go in and understand that something has to change, but that is a very, very important thing of what you're doing and what you're assessing when you go in. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned.

(00:39:29):
You don't want any of this ... People in the organization, they asked Mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other, that doesn't work. So one, you have to know that you're not going to do that. So if somebody would ask me something that it was in Cal's domain, I'd be like, "Did you talk to Cal?" I would never try and go around him. So we were very clear on, you're going to drive this, I'm going to drive this. And if it was unclear, we'd talk and we would say, "Okay. Who's going to take this one?" And we would do all our reviews together. And so all of the OKR reviews, we had weekly exec reviews, we had the updates on our OKRs, so we did them all together, but I knew here's the things that he was going to ask the questions on and dig deep. And then when I was, he would take a back seat, but of course we could ask questions in each other things, but I knew that he was taking ownership and he knew what I was taking ownership of.

(00:40:24):
But I think the bottom line was respect. Is that you have to respect and trust that they actually will follow up on what they say they will. In Cal and Fuzzy were amazing at that. I would go to Fuzzy and be like, "Hey, we need more mobile engineers because this one product is not going to ship." And he's like, "I'm on it. Got it." And that was all I needed to do. And obviously if he couldn't do it, he'd come back to me and, "Hey, there's going to be a problem." But it was like just things got done. That's the best part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):
You talked about being aligned, which I love and I fully have seen that power of that of you and your engine manager, design manager being aligned on ... And you tell me if I'm wrong, but specifically on what goals you're trying to achieve, what success looks like, things like that. Are there any tactics you found to create that alignment? And also if there's anything else you want to add to the point I just made about what it is you're specifically aligned on, that'd be great.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:41:19):
One, you got to spend a lot of time together. There isn't a way around that. And you have to document things and make sure that you've talked it through. And if you don't agree with something and you're not sure it's a priority, you have to speak up and you can't just be like, "Okay, whatever.", and then go to somebody in your team and be like, "Oh God, that that CTO, why did he make this decision?" That just doesn't work. So I'm a very direct person. So if I don't think that something is the right priority or is working, I will be very clear. We had different forms, so I'll be very tactical here on the forms that Cal and I had together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
Perfect.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:42:00):
We used OKRs to drive our processes and we would have the teams present OKRs to us. When the team got too large, it got to be too much time to go through every team's OKR review so we had a Slack channel for each team, their OKRs, a planning channel for each one. And people would post a doc and then a Slack video of going through the major points. And we had a time limit of how long they were allowed to be. And they would say, "Here's our OKRs, here's the things that you would pay attention to." And then Cal and I would do a marathon and we would watch them all together. And-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):
In a room sitting there watching them together?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:42:38):
Correct. And then we would say, "Do we have any follow-up questions?" And we put in channel our follow-up questions to the team. And sometimes there'd be five to 10 teams that we would then have a follow-up meeting with. We would say that this is a really high priority project or there are a lot of questions that we have, and then we would do a meeting but we were always doing those meetings together. So that was the OKR reviews of getting the alignment. And by asking the questions, we could then ... By it just being us, we could dig into the team. And we each had a chief of staff, so it was the two of us plus our two chiefs of staff, and which they also did a divide and conquer and they worked really well together. They were both long time Slack employees. So for years they had ... One had been an engineering director and one had been a TPM. And then every Monday we had a Monday meeting where we reviewed the progress on the top OKRs and red, yellow, green and don't talk through the green ones, only talk through the red ones and what are the issues. And again, both there. And then we had a weekly meeting with the four of us where we would just go through any issues in the organization, what's going on, what's not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:50):
And the four of us is you, the CTO, the chiefs of staff.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:43:54):
Yep. And sometimes we would invite people. Like there's an issue with QA, so we'd have the QA leader come in and present to us. But we tried to limit the number of meetings with teams. So it'd be like the Monday meeting was the big meeting that you had to be there and you had to be able to talk to your project and that was it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
There's so much awesomeness here. I love the idea of this Async share your plan in a video instead of meetings with everyone in real time. And you could just do a lot of the stuff Async.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:44:22):
We iterated every quarter, just like you iterate on a product. So every quarter we would say did the OKR planning work or not, and then we would adjust. So we got to the point where at one point we added up all the hours of OKR reviews and all the people in them and it was some insane number, like 300 and something and we're like, "This has gotten out of hand." So then we're like, "We have to do something drastic." And that's when we moved them to Async. It was also right after Slack Clips launched.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:51):
Got it. That's the video feature. Very cool. Then I know you launched huddles, right? Slack Huddles? Did you use that as a part of this or eventually you just get people into a little huddle asynchronously and talk-

Tamar Yehoshua (00:45:01):
Sometimes. Absolutely. We would be in the reviews and we would huddle with somebody to ask a quick question. We use Huddled all the time. I still do. I love Huddles.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:09):
I love it. One crazy thing about Slack is people in Slack don't actually use email internally. It's like all in Slack. It's like the actual vision of Slack working within Slack.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:45:18):
No email unless you're dealing with somebody external. And no, it's mostly Slack Connect anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:24):
Anyway. Wow, that's amazing. Okay. I have one more question around product stuff and then I want to talk about AI. So I was reading your newsletter on Substack, which we'll link to and you share this really interesting insight that I've experienced myself that I'll quote you here. One of the mistakes that I see a lot of product managers make is they over index on people who are going to be unhappy with the products they're launching. And basically your advice is not to worry so much about making users unhappy, which I think is counterintuitive to some people. Can you just talk about this lesson and I'd love to hear what product you launched that made people unhappy that you realized, oh, maybe we don't need to worry about this as much.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:46:04):
I saw it more when you unlaunch things, you take things away there's always some set of users that are using a feature that nobody else does, and then you take it away and they're super unhappy, but there are more people you're going to make happy. So a product manager gets caught in this trap of the vocal minority and the number of people using your product ... Depends on what phase. Are you a Google? Are you Slack? Are you a Glean? But the number of people using your product today is usually unless you're a Google far smaller than the number of people who are going to be using your product tomorrow. So design it for the bigger number of people who are going to be using it tomorrow. If you have to redo the UI and the Who Moved My Cheese, people will be unhappy, but all the new people are going to be like, "This is so much easier." Then do it and deal with the people who are unhappy.

(00:47:02):
But the trick is you have to be respectful and you have to be transparent and you have to explain. You have to go to people and say, "This is why we made this change." And you have to be authentic. You can't be dismissive and you can't have marketing speak. You have to really say, "Here's for real why." And you have to listen to your audience. You don't want to alienate your early users because most people ... If you made a good decision on why you moved this or why we stopped using Slack calls and moved to Huddles and you have to do it over time and give people choice and then give them enough time to move. So you have to do it in the right way. But if people feel heard, it makes a difference.

(00:47:50):
I have an example that's not a product example, but I think is a really good one. It's a leadership example. So when I was at Google, there was always a controversy about something, but there was a controversy about ... It was Blogger or something. I can't even remember what it was. It was like we made a change. We were like 50,000 people at the time. There was an engineer in my team, an IT engineer that was super unhappy about the change. And I knew Rachel Whetstone, she was in charge of all of PR and global policy at Google. So huge job. And I emailed Rachel and I'm like, "Hey, do you have an FAQ or something that can help me? Because I don't know why you made this change and that I can help explain to the engineer in my team."

(00:48:33):
She did not respond to my email. She picked up the phone and she called him. I had no idea she did this. She just called this IT engineer and she listened to him and she heard why he was upset and she explained her reasoning. He was so blown away that she called him that he completely changed his opinion and then he told everyone else in the org. And so it had this effect. And I learned a lot from watching her do that. She never even told me she did it later. She just did it. You just act. You're authentic. You listen to people and you're transparent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):
It's so funny. This reminds me of a parenting book I'm reading right now that a former guest recommended called Listen. And the core thesis of the book is when your kids are acting up or they're getting off track, so much of what they need is a sense that you're connected to them, a connection which is rooted in you listening to them. And so all-

Tamar Yehoshua (00:49:34):
My favorite parenting book ... I don't know if this is the same one or a different one, it's How to Talk so Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kids Will Talk. Maybe it's the new name of that book, but it's so good and it's so true in everything and also in products. So whether you're in a forum and explaining to customers, whether you're enterprise customers, you're explaining, you're hearing them out, people want to understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:58):
Amazing. There's so many applications of just the power of listening. Okay. Well, not quite a segue, but let's talk about AI. You're at the epicenter of AI now with Glean. How do you anticipate AI will change our jobs and product? What do you think people may be aren't recognizing it, realizing it? What have you seen?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:50:21):
I'm going to give you a little bit of my history with AI to get to that point. When AI was a completely different technology stack ... I have a master's in AI. So I started working in AI when ... It's evolved so much. And then of course at Google using it for auto complete and search. It's transformed so many times. But then with this last transformation of GenAI ... And that's what brought me to Glean of seeing this, meeting lots of AI companies and like, "Wow. This is really going to transform how we work." And it's just fascinating seeing these products. I was one of those people like, "Oh yeah, it's going to be so far away." Until I saw GPT3. And I think AI, we are underestimating how much it's going to change how we work. It's not going to be sudden from today to tomorrow because people haven't figured it out yet. They haven't figured out how exactly to leverage it. But the people who have are going to be so far ahead. They're going to be far ahead of everyone else because they're going to be working faster, they're going to be working better.

(00:51:33):
And in five to 10 years, I think the lines between product managers and engineers and designers are going to blur because AI will enable product managers to build prototypes, to build designs. Designers to build a pro like Figma already has their Figma AI. You can press a button and you can get your initial prototype working. You've got all the co-pilots. So they're not quite there. You still, like with Copilot or with Cursor, you need to be an experienced engineer to know when it's getting it wrong, but they're going to keep getting better. I think people have to be careful about not getting left behind, but their jobs aren't going to go away. They're just going to change. I'm of the believer that we're just going to have a lot more software. But I talked to engineers and to PMs saying, "Yeah, I tried that. It doesn't really work." And then go back to how I worked before. And that's a dangerous spot to be in I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):
For people that get anxiety hearing this where they're feeling they're going to be left behind and like, "Oh my God, I don't know enough time to do this or I don't know what I'm doing here." Do you have any advice for what's something someone can do to not fall behind?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:52:48):
Use the products. This is what good PMs should do period. Always be using new products. It's not a unique thing for AI. When mobile came out, PMs needed to be using mobile apps all the time to try them out, see what the UIs are, see what's working and what isn't. And the same goes even more for AI. Use ChatGPT. If your organization has Glean, use Glean. Use Claude. Try them all. Try them and see what they do. I was talking to a product manager I know who is more forward-thinking and loves playing with new products and he had this use case that blew me away. So he said ... And this was a couple of months ago, so before ... It was right when Gemini had expanded the context window. So his product had a Discord channel and he took the transcript from the Discord channel, which was huge. And he fed it into Gemini the entire channel and then used it to ask questions. Like what is the sentiment of my product? What is the most requested feature? What are the things people are unhappy with? This never would've occurred to me. It's like, that is so smart. And he's like, "It was like a goldmine." Do you know how long it would've taken him to read? And he just wouldn't have done it.

(00:54:06):
So think about for the argument, oh, I'm too busy. Well, if you use these products it's going to be a leverage on your time. So you get a lot of articles sent to you, summarize them, use AI to summarize the articles. We use Gong at Glean to record all our sales calls. We have a Glean app that will read all the Gong transcripts, put them in a spreadsheet in a certain format of who the AE is, etc. And then summarize all the top requested features from all the Gong calls. And it took a while to get it right. At first the summarization, the prompt wasn't good enough and would give us features that our salespeople would recommend and didn't distinguish that this was actually the customer. So you have to tweak it. It's not going to work out of the box. But then we got it to the point where it worked and these things really save time and you have to use your creative juices as a PM to figure out how it can help you and have patience to iterate and keep trying because the models that we have today can do a lot already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:22):
Yeah. I love your example of the PM and what they did with the Discord channel. Is there anything else along those lines that either you've done to leverage some AI tool to be more productive or folks in your team have done to be more productive youth, either your product leaders or other folks?

Tamar Yehoshua (00:55:38):
So many examples. So one that I did really recently is I wrote a prompt in Glean to help me get the status of features. And we have a Launch Cal, and you can look at Launch Cal it'll say a date. But then is it really the date? What are the outstanding issues? So it will look at our Launch Cal and it will see if there are any open year tickets, what the Slack conversations are and the customers who are beta testing it, bring all these together to tell me, okay, launch date is this according to Launch Cal, but here are all the open issues and here are the open conversations that people are talking about. So then it can give me the confidence level of the future looking. So I can run the prompt, just put in the name of the feature. So I don't have to read all of these channels.

(00:56:28):
So this is a prompt that I built two weeks ago because we're advancing our prompting capabilities. And so I was testing it out and I was like, "Ooh, I could do this." So that's another example and engineers are using it for automating part of the incident management of I got an incident, how do I see were their previous incidents that were similar to it, where they're not. And so these are the type of things you can look at to help you. But the simplest, simplest is there's so much news. Let me just paste in all of these things and summarize them. As a product manager at Gleam, here are all the latest news. What do I have to care about? What's impacting me and potentially competitive to any of the products that I have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
And putting that into say Claude or ChatGPT you're saying.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:57:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):
Yeah. I think that beginning of the prompt is something a lot of people don't know is the power of just giving it a role like you are a product manager at Gleam. From that perspective, give me this summary versus just summarize this and that ends up being really powerful right.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:57:42):
A hundred percent. And you can compare what is Claude's PR saying that ... They just launched Claude Enterprise. How is Claude Enterprise different from OpenAI Enterprise? Again, you can do it yourself, but these micro improvements in your productivity help. For my newsletter, I interviewed Claire Vo who came out with ChatPRD. And so product managers are using is. We're just starting to evaluate it internally, so I haven't personally used it yet, but it's super cool and you can use ChatGPT to do a PRD. And ChatPRD, it's more templatized and more frameworks of how to do that. And again, these things are going to keep getting better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
Claire's been on the podcast, she's going to be speaking at the Lenny and Friends Summit coming up October 24th.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:37):
Oh, cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):
Yeah. A crazy stat she shared. She's making six figures off this product that she builds on the weekends ChatPRD.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:45):
So cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
Incredible.

Tamar Yehoshua (00:58:46):
But it also shows what you can build with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
Right. It's just her. I think she just recently hired some engineers to help because she has three kids CTO at LaunchDarkly and just is building this on the side making a hundred thousand plus dollars. Incredible. I want to add a couple of things here. So one is for folks looking for ideas for how to use AI tooling for their PM job. There's a couple of posts I've written that I'll link to in the show notes just to put that out there of just a bunch of PM sharing, here's what I've done with these various tools. Another thought I'd love to get your take on. There's a lot of fear that the PM job be replaced by AI. And I've recently realized that it's the opposite. I think the PM role is the best positioned to thrive in the world of AI because if you just think about you have a tool that can just build a thing for you, just like you're staring at this blank thing that can build anything for you, which function would you think would have the best chance of asking it of what to build and how to articulate what to build best?

(00:59:47):
To me, it's clearly Product People. They're best at figuring out what to build, what matters most, where the impact's going to be what customers need. Not to say other functions don't also have the skills, but I feel like of all functions, PMs have the most of that specific skill. I'd love to get your take on that.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:00:01):
That. I think that AI, the one thing it's not good at is being creative. So if you're a PM who's doing the grout work, it's going to take your job away. But if you're a PM who actually is strategic and can pull the pieces together and be creative and think how you do something that it's going to differentiate. Because it's not going to give you that leak. It'll say, here's what customers are asking for, here are the problems today, but you have to figure out how to solve it. So in some ways it might weed out the good from the bad PMs. Because there are a significant number of PMs who are more just execution. And I think that part of the job hopefully will be lowered because I hope a lot more of the execution will be able to automate updating Jira and all these things that just take time and creating even little Launch Cals, which PMs have to do manually now. So hopefully a lot of that work goes away and then people can be more creative. And I think designers and PMs are going to blend because the best designers I've worked with are product thinkers and a lot of really good PMs can also design. It depends on what kind of product you're PMing for. So I agree with the caveat that it will become harder to be a great PM.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):
Wait, say more about that. It'll be harder to be a great PM because many PMs are doing things that are mostly project management and that's the stuff that-

Tamar Yehoshua (01:01:30):
Yeah. Let me rephrase. It's not going to be harder to be a great PM, but to be a PM, the not so good PMs jobs will go away. The great PMs will still have great jobs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):
Yeah. I totally hear you. So in a sense there might be fewer. You might need fewer PMs, but I think that applies in theory to every function. Fewer engineers. Fewer designers.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:01:49):
I don't think you'll need fewer. I think you'll be able to do more things. Think about every company. Our head of sales came to me the other day, "You need to hire more engineers because we just have so many things we need to build." I'm like, "When have you ever worked in a company where you thought that you didn't need more engineers?" You always want people to build more stuff. So I don't think you're going to need fewer. I think you're just going to get so much more done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
A lot of people are building AI into their product. Glean is obviously an example which integrates LLMs, which innately are non-deterministic and hard to know if they're going to provide anything good. Sometimes something really dumb comes out. Do you have any advice on working with these very complicated systems that don't necessarily ... You can't control and building them into your products? Anything you've learned that might be helpful?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:02:41):
My first week at Glean was eye-opening in learning some of these things. But let me first just explain what Glean does for people who may not know. So Glean was started as enterprise search. Glean reads content of all your SaaS apps. So it reads the content from Microsoft, Google, Slack, Salesforce, Jira, like any SaaS tool that you use, it indexes it and enables you to search. So it started as just enterprise search and using AI. So it was an AI search using BERT models and using vector embeddings in 2019. Because the early engineers at Glean came from Google and Google created BERT to enhance search. And so it was obvious that they would be using ML techniques for search. Then GPT3 came along and added a natural language interface, a chat interface. You can ask the question in actual language and get an answer, and it basically is a knowledge graph of your organization. So you can ask any question. Think of ChatGPT for your enterprise. Ask any question about your enterprise.

(01:03:45):
So people understand search because they understand Google and you put in a query and then you refine it. But chat interfaces, people still don't really know how to use. If you look at the stats from ChatGPT, from what I understand, the retention is fairly low. People use it, they play with it, and then they don't get back to it because it's not in their workflow and they have a hard time figuring out what they can and can't do for it. When I got to Glean the first week I met with the assistant quality team and one of the biggest issues they have is people trying to use Glean for things that there's no way it could know. Like what should my top priority be next week when we don't even know what your priorities are. But then there's golden cases that are just amazing.

(01:04:44):
The example of refining queries and searched years for people to understand how to do. And it took a lot of features of auto complete and refinements at the bottom of the page. So we need to build in those things, guardrails to help with the change. To help suggest, oh, Lenny, here's what you could do. Here's a prompt to find out the status of your feature that Tamar built. So how do you give people guardrails so that they understand what is going to work and what isn't going to work? Because this whole, I don't know what I can ask. And then on top of that, the non-deterministic. An enterprise CIO will go use ChatGPT on the weekends, but they come to work and they expect their software to be deterministic. So how do you help educate users about that?

(01:05:34):
And then the other thing I'll say about using LLMs is the industry is transforming so rapidly that you need to make sure that your product gets better as the LLMs get better. And that too many people are building things to make up and compensate for the LLMs that all that work is going to go away. So it's okay to do it to understand that it's going to go away, but that can't be your differentiator. You have to understand that your differentiator is something that will continue to be there as the LLMs get better and smarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):
And as part of that, because the LLMs get so much smarter, everyone else will become awesome. And to keep up, you need something that is actually outside of the LLM that continues to differentiate you and is better than what other people are doing.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:24):
Well, yeah. That your whole product gets better as the LLMs get better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):
That makes sense.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:30):
It's a frame of a of mind of how you approach the value add you're having.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Awesome. Tamar, to close out our conversation, is there anything else that we did not cover that you think is important to share or you think might be helpful to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:06:51):
I in my decades of working in tech, have never been working in an environment that's moving so quickly and it's really exciting. It's super energizing and it's also scary. But you have to change how you're working. You have to change how you're working so that you can keep up because it's going to be an interesting decade ahead with all these new tools that are coming out. And staying ahead will be hard, but it's also, there's so much I think richness and opportunity here. So I advise people to get in the thick of it and try it out because you'll be surprised at how many products we can build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):
I love that. I can't help but drill in one level deeper. Is there anything you found to help you stay ahead and help you stay aware of what's happening? Are there newsletters you find useful? Chat, podcasts that just help you keep up to date on where things are going? Is it like a person you look to like, "Hey, what's new?"

Tamar Yehoshua (01:07:56):
There are definitely AI newsletters that I look at. There's AI podcasts that I listen to. I now have a commute, so in some ways that's good because I get to keep up on the AI podcasts. So I just try and listen. I'm trying to build some prompts for myself to make it easier to say ... Take in ... I haven't perfected this, but the ChatGPT voice mode where you can load it. Somebody who I just hired it at Glean was saying he does this. He loads up stuff before his commute and then he'll be like summarize these articles and then he can ask questions to it. So I need to up my game there. But I definitely have a list of Ben's Bites and The Neuron. Those are good summaries and I like Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast. I listen to Cognitive Revolution. There's too many of them right now, but I pick and choose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Awesome. Okay. We'll link to those ones you just mentioned in the show notes. We'll have Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast, it's called No Priors. I was actually just listening to it on the way here. Sarah is going to also be at Lenny's and Friends Summit. She's going to be moderating a panel between Kevin Weil and Mikey Krieger who are the CPOs of Anthropic and Open AI. So there we go. Another quick plug for lennyandfriendssummit.com. I think it's lennyssummit.com.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:15):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
With that Tamar we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:21):
I am ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:23):
Okay, let's do this. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:09:29):
So one book was recommended to me by Shashir, the CEO of Cota. When I started at Slack, he recommended the book Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath. And it's such a good book. And it's about how do you set a path for people to follow. It's the whole elephant and the rider. So setting the path but yet motivating people to go down the path. And I read it. We had an all hands about ... I don't even remember the topic. It was something that we were like all up in arms about that we had to do. And I had just read the book and after the all hands I went up to store it and I'm like, "You did that all wrong. You need to read this book. That is not how to get people motivated." And he read the book and he's like, "You're right." So it just changes how you think in organizations to affect change. So that's on the organizational leadership. And one book I really liked was a Team of Rivals. It's a book about Lincoln and putting together his cabinet during the Civil War. One, I just learned a lot about the Civil War that I didn't really know. And it's about, again, a book about leadership and it is fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):
I don't think anyone's recommended either of these. So love them. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:00):
I don't know if you like British murder mysteries.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
I don't know either.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:07):
It's a niche thing, but there's a guy named Anthony Horowitz and the latest series he did was called Magpie Murders. And it's just an intricate story so I enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Very niche but amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:26):
Well, I'm going to give two. One is tech and one is non-tech. So non-tech I really like dark chocolate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
Actually just like a dark chocolate bar.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:11:38):
A really good dark chocolate that's simple. Like no frills, none of this. Just dark chocolate. And I discovered this chocolate called Bisou chocolate. It's a guy in Oakland who makes it himself. Super niche. He was selling at the farmer's market. And it's just like if you want like a simple play, no nuts, no anything just-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
No sea salt.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:12:03):
Great pride in the beans he resources them from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
Wow. It's called Bisou with a B?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:12:08):
Yeah. Bisou as in Kiss in French. And then on the tech side, the honest answer is Glean. I was listening to your podcast with Nikita who said that people over 22 don't use new products except at work. And that stuck with me. The new products I usually use are at work and I use Glean 10, 15 times a day. I use it so much and it changed the way I onboarded. It changed the way I work. Even the simplest questions, you don't bother people, you don't interrupt people on Slack. You're like, "What's the latest status with this deal? What's the last time we talked to them?" I meet somebody at a conference and I can quickly say, "Have we ever talked to this company before?" And I can just get an answer. Or without asking an engineer, "Where's the latest design doc?" It has really transformed how I work. So I know it's cheating in that it's the product I work on, but it's the actual honest answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:10):
And for folks that haven't heard of Glean, it's one of the most successful B2B AI companies out there. It's like a very large successful business and company that if you haven't checked it out, you should definitely check it out.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:13:24):
As our investors say, it's one of the AI companies that's actually making money.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):
Very few of those. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, repeat yourself, share with friends or family and work or in life?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:13:41):
I have one that my father told me when I was being really indecisive about what college to go to. He was really bored of the conversation and he said, "There are no right decisions. You make a decision right." And it is so true. Because you never know what's going to happen in life. You just have to commit to whatever you're doing and have no regrets about it. You can't be like, "Oh," 10 years later, "what if I had taken that job over there?" It's like you make your success based on how you approach the decisions that you've made.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:18):
So if you feel regret about something, this is a good one to pull out of just I will make this the best I can make it, and that's all the best I can do.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:14:27):
You can move forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:29):
Move forward. I love that. Last question, I know you're a parent. I'm a new parent. I have a 14-month old at this point. Is there a piece of parenting advice that you learned early on that you think might be helpful to me or folks that are new parents or something you've just learned yourself that you think might be helpful?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:14:46):
14 months. I think the best parenting book I read besides the How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kid Will Talk is, I think it's called Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby. We are much happier when we sleep well. We perform better at work when we sleep well. Children need to sleep. So making sure that they sleep well. And sometimes that's like, I did the whole sleep training, cry until you fall asleep and my kids still speak to me. So it was okay. That is the basic things. Make sure that their basic needs are met and then as they grow up, share your life with them. So a piece of advice I was given was analogous to Talk so your Kids Will Listen is when they had come home from school. You can't just say, "How was your day?" Say, "You know what? I did a podcast with this person and it was super interesting because they talked about this or that." Or, "I'm massively screwed up and I should have asked them this or that." And they'll be like, "Oh my God, I was at school today and this is what happened." If you share your life with them, they will share their life with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):
Such good advice. I really appreciate it. Tamar, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. We got through so much great stuff. Everything I was hoping we get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to read up on more stuff that you share and just follow you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:19):
Find me on LinkedIn and I have a subject called Practical Intelligence where I've been interviewing practitioners who are working with AI. It was my way of learning. I started when I was a VC. Trying to continue doing it. And how can I be helpful if you are a customer of Glean, I'd love to know what you think, what works and what does more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):
What's the best way to share that with you? Is it like messaging on LinkedIn, subscribe to Substack?

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:45):
Message on LinkedIn, or comment on your-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:49):
On [inaudible 01:16:50]. Yeah.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:51):
Yeah. Those would probably be the two ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):
Awesome. Tamar, thank you so much for being here.

Tamar Yehoshua (01:16:56):
Thank you for having me.

# Build better products with continuous product discovery | Teresa Torres

## Transcript

Lenny (00:02):
Teresa Torres is a speaker, a teacher, a consultant, a product coach, and also the author of Continuous Discovery Habits, which is the number one most recommended book in my newsletter Slack community.

(00:13):
I'm also pretty sure Teresa is in the top five people in the world when it comes to the number of product managers that she's worked with, taught, and impacted. In our chat, we get deep into two topics: the opportunity solution tree framework, which is a really simple but incredibly powerful framework once it, and, two, we go deep into how to create a system within your team where you're talking to customers regularly.

(00:34):
We talk about ways to make a case for spending more time talking to customers and doing news research, the most common mistakes people make with interviewing and generally how to interview customers better, how to automate this process so that you don't spend a bunch of time, and so many other ways to bring you and your organization closer to your customers. Teresa's amazing, and I can't wait for you to learn from her.

(00:55):
This episode is brought to you by Persona. Persona helps founders, product managers, and engineers easily solve any identity-related problem, including handling KYC, AML, and basically all manner of identity fraud. You can integrate Persona in an afternoon and personalize your flows using their SDK to meet your users on any device.

(01:16):
Persona's identity building blocks allow you to manage your entire end-to-end onboarding flow, verifying that each new user and their data are legitimate. Persona is trusted by both startups and the world's largest companies, including Square, BlockFi, Gusto, and Udemy.

(01:32):
For a limited time, persona is offering listeners of this podcast a free end-to-end KYC and AML solution where you can collect users' government ID and/or they're selfie and automatically verify that those two pieces of data are legitimate. You can also enrich that information to automatically see if the person exists on various watch lists. Just go to withpersona.com/lenny to get started.

(01:59):
So many product managers are basically treated like project managers. You get hired thinking that you'll be deep in product strategy and vision and getting to know your customers, only to wind up organizing other people's work and refining backlogs and optimizing tiny, tiny features. If this sounds familiar, you need Dovetail, because Dovetail gets that the true heart of product management is understanding what customers want, why they want it, and how to give it to them.

(02:25):
That's why Dovetail built a suite of user research products that help you get to the core of what your customers really want and why they want it. Dovetail offers a suite of powerful analysis tools to help you identify themes, patterns, and insights in your customer interviews, allowing you to make better data-informed decisions about what solutions you should build next.

(02:45):

Try Dovetail's products free for as long as you need. You can sign up right now and dive right in at dovetailapp.com/lenny.

(03:11):
Teresa, thank you so much for being here. I don't know if this, but your book is consistently the number one most recommended book in my Slack community. Also, I've personally learned so much from you from your writing and just your tweets and all the ways that you share your lessons. And so, I'm really excited to delve into continuous discovery and all the things that you teach. And so, again, thank you for being here and welcome.

Teresa Torres (03:36):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (03:38):
How many PMs would you say that you've worked with through your consulting and through your courses? Just to give us a ballpark.

Teresa Torres (03:45):
That's a good question. I know through Product Talk Academy, we're just at about 11,000 students. I'm not very good at updating the number on our homepage. I think it still says something like 8,500. But officially I think we're just about to cross the 11,000 mark, which is a little bit mind-blowing to me and a ton of fun. Then on the coaching side, it's in the hundreds, not in the thousands, obviously because coaching is a little bit of a different beast. So, yeah, I'd probably say maybe 12,000.

Lenny (04:13):
That's incredible. Would you say that that maybe puts you in the top five PM teacher/influencer types that have worked with maybe the most PMs, just roughly? Just to give people a little context.

Teresa Torres (04:24):
I don't even know how to evaluate that. I still think about some of the really early people that had an influence on me and to see that some of them now recommend my book, it's just mind-boggling. It's pretty cool.

Lenny (04:37):
Yeah, I feel the same way sometimes with my newsletter. I'm like, oh, hey, this person that I always looked up to as a legend is now sharing my stuff. It's crazy.

Teresa Torres (04:44):
Yeah.

Lenny (04:44):
Before we get into the meat of the chat, just real quick, to plug your site and where to discover all the things that you do, what's the site people can check out while we chat?

Teresa Torres (04:52):
Yeah. So my site is producttalk.org. Then there's a few things like my blog at producttalk.org/blog. We put out two articles a month. Then we have a whole bunch of courses related to discovery at learn.producttalk.org.

Lenny (05:05):
Awesome. We'll chat a bit more about that at the end. So in our chat, I was hoping we'd cover two main topics, things that I've maybe learned most from you over the years. One is the opportunity solution tree framework. Then two is just the general idea of continuous discovery and all the ways to approach that. Does that sound good?

Teresa Torres (05:24):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (05:25):
Okay. So starting with the opportunity solution tree framework, it's such a simple but such a powerful way to visualize your strategy, your levers, how to prioritize, get buy-in from people, get everyone on the same page. It's probably the thing I share most of what you've put out with people. So I'd love to maybe start with just like what is this framework, what problem does it solve for people, and how can people apply it to their product problems?

Teresa Torres (05:51):
Yeah, really good question. So first of all, it's just a really simple visual. It's funny how simple it looks, because using it in practice is really complex. I definitely have a new appreciation for that, trying to teach it over and over again and seeing where people struggle.

(06:06):
So it's a tree visual. So it's just like a decision tree. It starts with an outcome at the root of the tree, and then it branches into the opportunity space and then it branches into solutions, and maybe even assumption tests from there.

(06:19):
The purpose of it is I recognize that while as an industry, some companies are moving from this output focus to an outcome focus, most product teams don't really know how to manage this really complex problem of how do I start from an outcome and figure out what to build? It's a really unstructured, wide open, hard problem.

(06:41):
A lot of teams, they learn how to do their jobs building products by being told, "Build these features." That's a really structured, okay, I just turn out some work problem. And so, we're asking teams to fundamentally do a really different type of job and I think teams needed some scaffolding for how do you make that shift. And so, that was the purpose of the opportunity solution tree is how do I add some structure to this wide open, messy problem.

(07:08):
Now the reason why it looks simple but it's really hard in practice is like, well, what's an opportunity and how do I structure the opportunity space? I can tell you that opportunity is an unmet need pain point or desire, and that's great. But I can tell you that 98% of people that write opportunities write them as solutions.

(07:26):
So we tend to just really struggle with this distinction between the problem space and the solution space. I think that the heart of good product is really getting comfortable in the problem space or the opportunity space, really taking the time to frame a problem well, and to really get into what's needed before we jump to solutions.

(07:48):
But it's the opposite of how our brains are wired. And so, teaching people to be comfortable with that discomfort of staying there is hard. I mean I see blog posts written about how they're using the opportunity solution tree, and I cry a little bit because their opportunity space is all solutions. I don't want to knock down somebody's blog post, but I also don't want this bad example out there in the world when I'm trying to teach how do we do this well. So I haven't found the right line there yet other than I'm going to blog about good examples.

Lenny (08:20):
Is there an example of a tree that, just to make it even more concrete, like for a company or product that you've worked with or that you think about?

Teresa Torres (08:26):
Yeah. So I like to use streaming entertainment as my examples, because literally everybody in the world is familiar with Netflix. If I think about their opportunity space, I recommend teams structure the opportunity space using an experience map, like if you take your outcome.

(08:41):
So if we start with Netflix, if you think about the experience of you're trying to get me to engage with Netflix more, I want to understand what's the experience of somebody using streaming entertainment to entertain themselves. Maybe even broader than Netflix. If you watch YouTube TV, that's probably still relevant for me to learn about and understand.

(09:02):
And so, the way that I'm going to structure my opportunity space is I'm going to look at what's the overall experience of trying to entertain yourself a streaming entertainment. That might look like, well, first there's this trigger of I need to decide to watch something. Then there's this experience of how am I deciding what to watch? Usually wrapped up in that is what platform am I watching it on? Those are sometimes inner mixed, because maybe you're deciding, "I want to watch Game of Thrones ," and that's right away sending you to HBO Max, or maybe you're like, "Well, I want to watch a movie," and I could be on any platform.

(09:34):
Then there's the evaluation process of is this movie good or not? Does it look like something I want to watch? Then I want to get into, okay, I'm ready to watch. Is it a good viewing experience? Then for a lot of these platforms, there's also this post-viewing experience of like am I going to encourage you to keep watching, things like that?

(09:52):
So that's how I would structure that opportunity space is just there's these distinct moments in time. Then what I'm capturing is, below each of those, what are the needs and pain points and desires that arise? So if we just focus on that one around how do I decide what to watch, there's all sorts of needs that come up. Some are really tactical, like I have a movie title in mind and I just don't know how to find it. That's a pain point. Or, hey, I was watching a show. How do I get back to it? It's also a pain point. But then there's also these big media opportunities, like I can't tell if this show is good or not.

(10:27):
And so, everything that I just said, there was no solutions in there. In fact, whether I work at Netflix or I work at Hulu, our opportunity spaces probably look pretty similar. Now the ones we choose to go after and how we solve them might look really different. But the core human needs of what's your experience as we go about our lives entertaining ourselves is pretty similar.

(10:51):
I think the companies that build really good products, they either intuitively or explicitly take the time to really understand what does that journey look like and what are those needs and pain points and how do we create a really seamless experience?

Lenny (11:04):
We're going to link to the blog post and a few examples in the show notes so people can look at this visually, because I know we're trying to describe it through words. A quick follow-up question. So you have this tree with the outcome, say, get people to watch more Netflix. I imagine you recommend, max, three to five levers below that. Is that right? Then the rest just sits somewhere else?

Teresa Torres (11:25):
Yeah, that's a really good question. So at the top level, I tend to map those opportunities to steps in that experience map. So in that Netflix example, it'd be the trigger of I want to watch something, deciding what to watch, the viewing experience. I do find that, oh, is it Miller's magic number? The plus or minus seven rule is pretty good. I would say nine is probably a lot. So I would say maybe in that three to seven range. That's just because you could cognitively process your tree.

(11:57):
So the other thing that I get into is as you move vertically down the tree, your opportunities are getting smaller and smaller, which is really key to helping us unlock a continuous cadence. So if I start with that example of I can't decide what to watch, it's a really big hard evergreen problem. As long as Netflix is in business, they're probably going to have people focused on that problem.

(12:16):
But we can deconstruct it. Maybe I can't find something to watch because I don't know if this show's any good. Then we can learn about how do people evaluate shows. Maybe there's a small opportunity in there of who's the cast? It's one of the ways I evaluate a show. Now we're getting into an opportunity that we can actually solve.

(12:33):
So that's one of the other benefits. As we work our way down the tree, we get to smaller and smaller opportunities. We get to things that we can actually address. We're still contributing to that bigger, harder problem. And so, what it's allowing us to do is get this big picture view of where we could play, and then we can make more strategic decisions about where do we actually want to play. Then it's very customer-focused because it's really all about what's your need in this moment? How can I help satisfy that?

Lenny (12:59):
If you want to reduce friction in your onboarding flow, then let me tell you about Stytch. That's Stytch with a Y. Stytch is on a mission to eliminate friction from the internet. They're starting by making user authentication and onboarding more seamless and more secure. They offer super flexible, out-of-the-box authentication solutions for companies of all size.

(13:30):
Stytch customers have been able to increase conversion by over 60% after spending just one day integrating. With their API and SDKs you can improve user conversion and retention and security all while saving valuable engineering time. Your engineers will come and thank you for using Stytch because Stytch keeps you from having to build authentication in-house, and the integration process is super fast and super smooth. To get $1,000 in free credits, just go to stytch.com, and that's Stytch with a Y, and sign up. Just mention that I sent you.

(14:03):
For PMs and just maybe founders that are listening and they're like, "This sounds really useful. I want to create my own little opportunity solution tree," I know this a big question, but how do you go about figuring out what goes into each of these steps, however briefly, you can give people some guidance?

Teresa Torres (14:17):
Yeah. So the reason why this is so hard is that ... I mean it sounds really simple, but here's why it's hard. Opportunities emerge from our customers' stories. I don't think most people, when they're interviewing, they collect stories. So if, Lenny, I was going to interview you about your Netflix experience, the vast majority of product teams are saying things like, "Hey, Lenny, what do you like to watch on Netflix? How do you decide what to watch?" We're asking these direct questions out of context.

(14:43):
The challenge with that is we know from human psychology and cognitive psychology that we're not very good at answering those questions out of context. Actually, that sounds weird. We're very good at answering them. Your brain will come up with a fast answer, but that answer doesn't necessarily reflect your behavior, and it misses context and nuance.

(15:01):
You can tell me, "I just like action movies. I always look for action movies." I can't visualize your experience. I don't know what your experience is watching action movies. I just collected a fact about you. But if I ask you, like, "Tell me about the last time you watched a movie," now I can collect things like where were you and who were you with and set the scene for me, and what happened first and how did you choose that? I'm going to get answers to all those direct questions, but it's grounded in this specific instance. It's going to be a lot more reliable. And I'm going to start to hear unmet needs, pain points, and desires.

(15:36):
The really powerful thing is I might hear needs that you're not even aware of. We're so used to everything being mediocre, we're not even aware of a lot of these needs that we have. But when we tell our stories, especially if you start to train your ear for this, you start to hear those needs.

(15:54):
So the first thing that makes this hard is you have to interview well. I think interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill. Grossly underestimated skill. So that's the first thing is that if you're not collecting rich stories in your interviews, it's going to be really hard to identify opportunities.

(16:12):
Then the second thing is that you have to be able to hear those opportunities. If you're still stuck with what's an opportunity versus what's a solution, it's tough. Then the third thing is this opportunity framing. I believe opportunity should be really specific.

(16:27):
A really great opportunity in the streaming space is it's hard to enter my password, select specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote. If anybody has had an Apple TV, especially the old remote, it's not a very precision device. Selecting those letters on the stupid onscreen keyboard is a horrible pain point. It comes up when we're entering our passwords, it comes up when we're searching for movie titles. That's a really specific opportunity.

(16:53):
The value of that is we can solve it. Whereas teams tend to want to frame opportunities as like, "I wish this was easier to use." Okay, well, we can spend our lives making this product easier to use. What are you solving for who? And so, we're skill stacking. Then we've got to interview well. We've got to be able to hear opportunities. We've got to be able to frame them well. Then in order to structure the opportunity space, we have to be able to come pull out this common experience map, structure across seemingly unique stories.

(17:21):
So there's a lot of skill involved. I wish I could just say, "Hey, Lenny. It's super easy. Everybody should do it. I think it's really powerful, and I've seen it be a game-changer for teams. It's hard.

(17:32):
I tell my teams when I teach it in class, I say, "Look, we're going to focus on structuring an opportunity space, and I'm probably going to make you think harder than you've ever had to think in your job," because we don't think that much at work. We go from meeting to meeting, we stay surface level a lot, and here I am coming in with this really hard critical thinking exercise.

(17:53):
But I've just seen from teams that are willing to put in that work, it really is a game-changer. You have a deeper understanding of what your customers need and you build better products.

Lenny (18:02):
Man, thinking deeply.

Teresa Torres (18:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (18:03):
No fun, but it's so important. I want to chat about interviewing and all the advice you have about just how to interview. But before we get to that, one last question around the opportunity solution work. So the whole idea is to think outcome-oriented. To your point, a lot of companies have product teams that are just like, "Build these things for us. Don't worry about why we're doing these."

(18:24):
If your company is of that ladder sort, more of a feature factory, can you use this framework to push the team and the company in a direction of thinking outcome-oriented, or is there a more direct approach to address that problem?

Teresa Torres (18:37):
Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about this based on the role. If you're an individual contributor and you're not at a 10-person company, I would say don't try to force the organizational change. Organizational change is such a hard and messy problem. I feel like what I would do in that situation is I would just change the way that I individually worked.

(18:56):
This is what I always did in every job. I mean I made a lot of mistakes trying to change the organization, but I also just carved out a way for me to work this way. I think we underestimate how much ability we have to do that. So even if you're being prescribed a fixed roadmap, you still can find customers to talk to.

(19:14):
I hear from people all the time say, "I'm not allowed to talk to customers." I go, "Okay, well, your company doesn't own you when you're not at work. I bet you know people like your customers. Why don't you just start there?"

(19:24):
So we overthink it. We think we have to go through these proper channels and we have to get permission from sales. A lot of us, especially if we work on a consumer product, just go find somebody that's like your user. But I've also seen instances in B2B environments, where like I worked with that team that worked on badges for healthcare, the badges that nurses and doctors use to unlock a workstation that they chart in. This team, for weeks, ran into problems finding a customer to talk to.

(19:52):
I just said, "Hey, do any of you know doctors or nurses in your personal network?" The product manager was like, "Yeah, I have two uncles that are doctors." "Huh. Maybe we could just start there." Go talk to somebody.

(20:05):
I think that even if you aren't being tasked with an outcome, if you do the work to understand these are the outcomes that matter to your business for your product, it's probably going to start with your business model, and then work to understand how the work that you're doing contributes to that. All those little teeny tiny decisions we make every day, even if you're being prescribed solutions, you'll make better decisions, because you have a fuller context of what your business needs. You have a fuller context of what your customer needs.

(20:36):
So I think for most of us, if you're in an individual contributor role, just focus on developing the habits yourself. I'm always amazed, I was always amazed at how much I could do by just ignoring everybody around me and how they were working and finding a way to do it.

Lenny (20:51):
I love that because it lets you empower yourself and not wait for permission for excuses. This is always such a recipe for success for any role, especially PMs that are annoyed by how maybe their company works.

(21:02):
This is a really good segue to our second topic around continuous discovery. We've been touching on a lot of the elements of it, interviewing and understanding pain points and all that. And so, maybe just to set a little bit of foundation, what is continuous discovery? Your book is named after it. You, of course, is on this, which the general idea of continuous discovery.

Teresa Torres (21:22):
Yeah, let's just start at the beginning. So we often talk about discovery and contrast with delivery. Discovery is just used to describe the work we're doing to decide what to build. So everybody, every company is doing discovery. Everybody is making decisions about what to build.

(21:37):
We have a few trends that have been evolving very slowly over the last 20 years. One of which is we're recognizing that if we want to make good decisions about what to build, we probably should include the customer somewhere in that process.

(21:49):
So I teach a customer-centric view of discovery. Let's build in some feedback loops of are we making the right decisions, or are we making good decisions? Because there probably aren't right decisions here.

(22:00):
So then there's a second trend that we're seeing across the board, which is we're recognizing that digital products are never done. It's not like the Netflix team is going to show up to work one day and be like, "Hey, our product's good enough." We're always iterating, we're always improving. Customer needs are always evolving. There's always more we could do.

(22:18):
And so, we're seeing a shift from this project mindset that worked in a world where we were just trying to get products on a store shelf. We designed them, we built them, we manufactured them, we put them on the store shelf, we were done. We moved on to the next thing.

(22:32):
But with digital products, there's no done. So we're seeing this shift to more of a continuous mindset. We're continuously evolving our products, which means we're continuously making decisions about what to build and, therefore, I think we need to continuously include the customer in that process. So for me, I define continuous discovery as building in those continuous feedback loops.

Lenny (22:55):
Awesome. That's such a simple, clear way of thinking about this because, yeah, broadly it's like a new term people have to get used to. I think you saw I made a call on Twitter for people to ask me to ask you questions about continuous discovery. And so, I'm going to try to get as many of those in there in this chat as I can. One actually was around what do you do when your leaders tell you there's no time for discovery?

Teresa Torres (23:18):
Yeah, this is a tough one. I think this comes from old project-based research methods. So we don't most of the time have time to stop what we're doing and go do some research. I'm not pooh-poohing research. I mean I've worked as a user researcher. Research is critical. If we had the luxury of doing long longitudinal studies, we would probably build better products.

(23:40):
That's not our business environment. Our businesses are expecting us to deliver continuous value, so we need to look at how do we match that cadence. What I think is really nice about continuous discovery, you can do it in as little as an interview a week, on the interviewing side, on the discovering opportunity side.

(23:58):
Assumption testing. People always ask me, "How much time should I be spending on an assumption testing?" I don't know how to answer that question because for me, assumption testing and delivery are the same work. Assumption testing is the start of your delivery. I don't know where one starts and one ends, which is a little bit hard to conceptually work through, but maybe we can talk through an example.

(24:20):
So when somebody says, "I don't have time for discovery," I think what they're really saying is, "I don't have time for project-based research," and I agree with that. We don't have time for project-based research. So if I'm getting that pushback, I want to look for, okay, I definitely don't ...

(24:33):
Like people make this mistake of we shouldn't put something in our backlog that hasn't been properly discovered. It's not true. Everything in our backlog is a bet, everything. Whether we do discovery or not, everything is a bet. Discovery is helping us make a better bet.

(24:52):
Now sometimes in our organizations, we need to do a lot of discovery and make as good of a bet as we can. But there's other times we can make a risky bet. There's times in business where it makes sense to make a risky bet. If you work somewhere where all of your bets have been risky because you're doing zero discovery, the best way to kill any appetite for discovery is to say, "Let's stop making bets until we discover." No, don't do that. Keep making bets. In parallel, start doing some discovery so that eventually those bets get better.

(25:29):
I think the reason why people make this mistake is they think about it as phases. First I discover and then I deliver. No, you're always delivering and you're always discovering. The more you build this discovery habit, the better those bets are going to get with time.

(25:44):
So it's not that you do one first and then the other. It's you're always doing both. The benefit of always doing both is with time you make better bets.

Lenny (25:51):
You said that you could do this with one meeting like an hour a week. I know you have a system that you recommend for people to make this automated so you're not just constantly pinging your customers, "Hey, can I chat with you this week?" Can you just share that?

Teresa Torres (26:04):
Yeah. So my book, Continuous Discovery Habits, I do share some of the most common ways to automate the recruiting process. So this idea came from ... I had just read Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein, when it came out a few years ago. They had this idea of when you're designing a choice architecture, how do you make it easier to adopt the behavior you want to see than to not adopt the behavior?

(26:26):
So I started thinking about this in the context of interviewing. I want to see product teams interview every week. So how do I make it easier for them to do that than to not do that?

(26:35):
Okay, well a lot of us have recurring meetings that we go to every week because they're on our calendar. So I just started to think about how do I make an interview a recurring meeting? Can I make it so that when you wake up on Monday morning, there's an interview on your calendar and you literally did nothing to get it there?

(26:50):
And so, there's a few ways to think about this. The most common strategy is to allow your customers to opt in while they're using your product or service. So just almost everybody's seen an NPS survey embedded in a product. That's pretty prevalent now. Same idea, but instead of saying, "Would you recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?" it says, "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?" If they say yes, you send them some scheduling software, they pick a time on your calendar, and voila. You've got an interview scheduled.

(27:18):
You obviously can get more advanced. Where do you show it? Who do you show it to? How much do you tailor it? How do you position it? But the core idea is to let people opt in while you already have their attention. That works really well for consumers and B2B end users.

(27:34):
If you're trying to get in touch with buyers and decision-makers, same idea but use your internal teams that are already on the phone with those folks. So that salespeople, account managers, maybe support folks, they're literally on the phone with those people all day every day. So instead of using your product to recruit, you can use those teams to recruit.

(27:54):
What I do is I just have teams define a trigger every week, like, "Hey, this week we're looking to talk to somebody who's experiencing this need or pain point. If you happen to be on the phone with someone who's experiencing that, again, just go ahead and use scheduling software, put it on our calendar." The goal is for the product team to not be involved at all. They literally just have to show up and connect the interview.

Lenny (28:15):
That's amazing. Are there tools that you recommend that are just plug and play that make this easy? I know Calendly is probably a part of this.

Teresa Torres (28:21):
There are so many. So even on the scheduling side, I think Calendly innovated in that space, but there's so many fast followers. I think Outlook does this now. I think Google has a tool that does this now. I think even Salesforce has a tool that does this now. So if you're sales team is scheduling through Salesforce. Then on the intercept side, like how are you asking those? We have survey tools.

(28:45):
Qualaroo, I think, innovated in this space. Then I think Ethnio is a fast follower. But Intercom does this, Usabilla does this, Chameleon does this. Hotjar might even do this. We have so many user research tools that they're all now enabling this type of thing.

Lenny (29:03):
Awesome. For when you're actually doing the interviewing, we had a couple of questions from some Teresa fans. One is when you know what the solution should be, how do you stay disciplined and keep an open mind and keep searching for maybe something even better?

Teresa Torres (29:17):
Yeah. First of all, you don't always have to do that. Not all solutions need a lot of discovery. That's a common misunderstanding, I think. I think we need to do really robust, good discovery on the things that are part of our core product experience or going to be differentiators. We don't really have to do really amazing core discovery on the forgot password flow if it's working fine and you're not hearing about it as a pain point.

(29:42):
Now to be fair, Slack with their magic link, did a cool thing with the forgot password flow. That was a nice innovative thing that I think moved the industry forward. So if you want to do discovery on that, great, but you probably don't have to. So I think the first thing to assess is we're making a bet. How much risk is involved in this bet and how much of that risk do we need to mitigate?

(30:06):
Now most companies think there's no risk in any bets and they do zero discovery. If you're not instrumenting your product and actually measuring the impact of those solutions, you may not be catching that there actually was a lot of risk. So I think you do need to instrument your product. You do need to measure the impact of everything that you release so you can start honing your judgment on where is there risk in ideas.

(30:29):
When you're new to discovery, I recommend you overindex on doing a little too much discovery so that you start honing your judgment of that risk. But if you're working on an opportunity that's really core to your product functionality, it is a differentiator, it's where you want to make sure you have a really robust, good solution, I think the best way to guard against what you think is the obvious solution is to work with multiple solutions for the same opportunity.

(30:53):
Compare and contrast. We already know this intuitively. When you're looking for a place to live, you don't look at one apartment or house. You look at multiple, you compare and contrast. When you're looking for a job, you don't talk to one company. We know if we want to make good decisions, we need options and we need to evaluate the pros and cons of each. The same is true in the product world.

(31:13):
So if you're feeling like this needs to be a really good solution and we're having some challenges, we're overcommitting to one, that's when you need to increase your options.

Lenny (31:23):
I'd love your insight on, as a PM, how much ... In theory, you should be a little bit unbiased and giving people a chance to change your mind and come up with ideas that maybe you disagree with. On the other hand, as a PM, you always have opinions about what the right answer is. Just like in the PM function, do you have a perspective on how much more, say, a PM should have maybe over what ends up being decided?

Teresa Torres (31:47):
Yeah, this is a tough question. I mean there's such strong opinions about this. I mean I see analogies of the product manager is the decider and they're the CEO of the product. I think this is coming from toxic business culture personally. Business has taught us we all play a role. We have our functional silos. I have territory, you have territory, and we're going to play the internal office politics game. I need to defend my territory and you need to defend your territory.

(32:13):
The outcome is that we don't really collaborate. When we don't collaborate, I don't think we build very good products. So if we just go back to real life and when you're hanging out with friends and you're trying to accomplish something, the example I gave is when you're a little kid and you're playing, you don't like to first stop and say, "What's my role? What's your role?" I guess it's just not how humans interact. We all collaborate and we all do it intuitively. Business has taught us otherwise.

(32:40):
I'm going to forget the researcher, but there's a really cool ... The marshmallow test experiment. Are you familiar with this? Where teams are given spaghetti sticks and some tape and some string and a marshmallow. They're told to build a structure to get the marshmallow as high as possible.

(32:56):
A study's been done so many times. It's been replicated a million times with lots of different groups. It's a really cool story because kindergartners outperform almost every adult group, including MBA students. It's really telling. Why is this?

(33:10):
Kindergartners just start doing. They don't worry about their rules. They don't worry about who's in charge. They just brute force trial and error. What do MBA students do? There's posturing, like who has power and who's the decision-maker and who's right? We need a plan and we need to have a strategy. They spend the whole time negotiating this political social space instead of just doing. I really think we've got to learn how to get back to just doing.

(33:37):
And so, people think that I'm like Pollyanna naive about this, but I've worked on teams that work this way and I've coached teams that work this way where the trio really does decide. So the trio is the product manager, the designer, and the software engineer. If you've never worked in a well-functioning trio, this breaks people's brains, because they say, "Well, what are we going to do when we disagree?" You're going to find an option where you don't disagree.

(34:00):
The thing is if you only worked on a siloed dysfunctional team, that sounds like a nightmare. But if you've worked on a well-functioning team that's doing discovery well together, you're working from a shared understanding. So your disagreements right away are going to go way down because you're working from a shared understanding, and when you disagree, you recognize, okay, we don't agree, we don't have the best option yet. You keep looking for that better option.

(34:26):
What's hard about talking about this is I fully understand probably 98% of the industry has never worked on a well-functioning product trio, and this idea sounds crazy. But I've also seen it in practice over and over again on really good teams, and there's something magical about it. So I'm going to keep promoting it and I'm going to hope that eventually we get from 2% to 3%. That'll be my little debt I put in the universe.

Lenny (34:49):
Yeah. I was just going to say that you're helping make that change and I'm excited for that to be the way that people operate. And so, maybe one takeaway is if that's something that you're spending a lot of time on and it's causing you a lot of stress, it probably means you're working at a company or on a team that maybe isn't optimal.

Teresa Torres (35:05):
I don't mean that to say there's something wrong with you or your teammates. This is a symptom of business culture. It's how we've been taught to work. So we have to unlearn that. We have to learn new ways of working. We do this in our courses. We force people to work in teams in our courses, and some people really hate it. But I think learning to work well in a team, especially when there's different perspectives and you disagree and how do you reconcile that, is a really important part of product work.

Lenny (35:32):
Awesome. Going back to discovery and interviewing, I definitely wanted to ask you what are, I don't know, two or three tips and best practices for interviewing/what are two or three things people usually do wrong that they should try to avoid?

Teresa Torres (35:47):
Yeah. The first one is the questions they're asking. So many people write these who why, how, 50-question long interview protocols. It leads to a cadence of the interview that is not a natural conversation. So I think the first thing to remember is that you're just talking to a human.

(36:06):
I actually tell people if your interview feels like you're having a beer with a buddy, that's a good sign. It should be that casual and that conversational. But we're not going to get there if I pepper you with 50 questions. We're going to get there by I'm going to collect your story. I'm going to be really curious. I might still have to pepper you with 50 questions to get your story, because there's this conversational norm of I say something, you say something. So I've got to teach you that I want your whole story and help you open up.

(36:36):
So that's one piece of it. It's just the cadence of the conversation really should feel like a natural conversation. Then the second piece of it is how do we do that? What's the skill? How do we elicit that story?

(36:46):
I teach in our interviewing class, you really don't have to think about what to ask. You could run an entire interview by asking them one question. In fact, let's role play this a little bit. Lenny, tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming entertainment service.

Lenny (37:00):
Just last night I was watching Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney+.

Teresa Torres (37:04):
Okay. Yeah. Great. Okay, so it was last night. Set the scene for me. Where were you?

Lenny (37:09):
I was at home on my couch, just lounging.

Teresa Torres (37:11):
Okay. Tell me about the moment where you decided you wanted to watch something.

Lenny (37:15):
It was 8:00 and I'm like, "It's time to watch something."

Teresa Torres (37:18):
Okay. Is that part of your normal routine?

Lenny (37:21):
Yeah, in the evenings. It's a good way to unwind and let my brain relax a little bit. Okay,

Teresa Torres (37:25):
Okay. So you're sitting on the couch, you decided it's time to watch something. What did you do next?

Lenny (37:30):
Turned on the TV, went to Netflix, didn't find anything. Went to Prime, didn't find anything. I'm like, "Oh yeah, Obi-Wan. Let's check that out."

Teresa Torres (37:39):
Okay. So I literally could continue this entire interview by just saying, "Oh, you opened Netflix. What happened next? Oh, you didn't find anything. How come?" All I have to do is just be curious about your experience. What I'm doing with my questions is just helping you tell the timeline.

(37:59):
Set the scene. I'm situating you back in that moment. Let's remember what you actually did. It was after dinner. You were sitting on the couch. What happened next? I can do that over and over again.

(38:09):
And so, one of the reasons why we get bad at interviewing, we're so worried about asking the next question, we stop listening to the interviewee. We just missed everything we were told. We missed those moments of like, "Oh, there is some friction. You couldn't find something to watch. Tell me about that. What did you consider on Netflix? Let's dig into that."

(38:27):
If I work on a team that's trying to help you find something to watch, that's a gold mine. You just told me you went on Netflix, you went on Prime. What were you looking at and what didn't resonate? Is it because you'd watched everything? Is it because it just didn't match your profile? There's so much to explore there.

(38:44):
But what I see most teams do is they stay really shallow. "Oh, okay. So you watched Obi-Wan on Prime. Great. Tell me another story." We just lost all the value.

(38:57):
And so, some of it is just slowing down and almost being a five-year-old. You really, instead of saying, "Why? Why? Why?" you can say, "What happened next? What happened next?"

(39:08):
Now there's this technique of summarize what you heard, show that you're listening to them, bring them back to the moment where you want a little more detail. But, yeah, it's a game-changer. What happens when you collect stories is you hear about things you would've never thought to ask about.

Lenny (39:23):
It's also really fun to share because I'm like, "Oh, this is fun," just talking about what I do.

Teresa Torres (39:27):
I love that you just said that, because people worry. How many times have you heard somebody say, like ... You asked the sales rep, "Hey, can I talk to your customer?" and they're like, "I don't want to ask them a favor." It turns out if you collect stories in your interviews, customers love it. Most of the time, in fact the sign that you ran a good interview, is your customer is going to say, "Wow. When can we do this again?"

Lenny (39:49):
Wow. I love that. The other piece of this that you haven't mentioned is there's a lot of focus on what you've done, not on what you would do or you could do. I imagine that's an important part of this.

Teresa Torres (39:57):
Product people are in the business of changing behavior, understanding and changing behavior. I think that's a really big mistake that teams make is, both in their prototype tests and in their interviews, they focus on what people would do, on what people think, on why they think they do something. It's all really unreliable. It's a garbage in, garbage out situation. The real measure is tell me about your behavior. What did you actually do? We have to help people do that.

Lenny (40:25):
Something else someone asked that I really wanted to cover is how does this process change as your company grows from early stage to later stage?

Teresa Torres (40:33):
Yeah. In an ideal world, it doesn't change because here's why. If I have a trio and they have an outcome and they're empowered to reach that outcome, and they're interviewing every week and their assumption testing to evaluate solutions, and they're finding things to build and they're driving their outcome, that's a really successful team. They could do that in a three-person company or they could do that in a hundred thousand-person company.

(40:58):
The primary difference is in a three-person company, there's no adjacent teams. In a hundred thousand-person company, there's a lot of adjacent teams. And so, you probably have some dependencies to manage. But you still should start with an outcome, be empowered to go after it, be empowered to come up with your own solutions.

(41:17):
What's going to be different in that a hundred thousand-person company is you probably have design patterns and libraries you got to rely on for a coherent user experience. You probably have another team that's working adjacent to you that you need to share your discovery work and be aware of what they're working on, because you do need to build a coherent product.

(41:34):
And so, as our companies get bigger, we have a lot of that lateral collaboration we have to do to make sure we're still building a coherent product. But I think the fundamental base unit stays the same.

Lenny (41:47):
Something that I've seen happen with larger companies, especially as companies grow, is a little bit of cynicism of user research, specifically how few people you talk to and how that leads to you making a decision. How do you respond to those kinds of concerns?

Teresa Torres (42:02):
I love this. I don't know why product teams suddenly are held to a standard that nobody else is held to. When somebody says something like, "Why is it reliable to make a decision based on one interview?" I just flip the question around. Tell me about the decisions you made last week. How many customers did you talk to? What data did you use?

(42:20):
Every human in business is making decisions with zero data. So I'm going to go with one is better than zero. That's a little bit of a flippant answer, but it's true.

(42:32):
Here's what's happening when that question comes up. I have an opinion that's different than yours. I don't like your conclusion so I'm going to nitpick it. In the product world, unfortunately, everybody in business has an opinion about what we should be building. And so, that's how we face that and we get held to this standard.

(42:52):
I have a real reason why we can make decisions based on small data. We're in the business of changing behavior, not seeking new knowledge. We have really good feedback loops. And so, we can make decisions based on small experiments because we're going to continue to get bigger feedback loops and more reliable data over time. Especially as we deliver and we do live production prototyping, we actually can get large-scale data. I don't want to start there because we're never going to ship anything.

(43:17):
So there is legitimately a valid reason why we can work on small data, but it's an unfair question, because we're not holding anybody else in business to that standard.

Lenny (43:26):
Along those lines, when does it make sense to run an experiment versus rely on user research? Do you have a mental model for how you think about that?

Teresa Torres (43:34):
Our language around this is terrible. It's so ambiguous. What's an experiment? What's user research? I would say experiments are user research. I'm trying to just dramatically simplify this.

(43:43):
I think from a discovery standpoint, we have two core activities: qualitative interviewing and assumption testing. And so, with qualitative interviewing, we're trying to learn about the opportunity space. Where do we see unmet needs, pain points, and desires? Interviewing is not the only way to identify opportunities. Observations are actually a better way. I focus on interviewing because it's something we can do sustainably week over week. Most teams don't have the ability to observe their customers every week.

(44:11):
On the assumption testing side, for me, anything that helps us evaluate a solution where we're starting with a very specific assumption is an assumption test. So we have experiments that I actually don't even think we should be running, because they're testing the whole idea before we have any idea if that idea has a strong foundation. They're taking too long. They cost too much money. They're taking too much time. So how do I break this down?

(44:37):
The first thing is we have to learn how to take an idea and break it into its underlying assumptions. We have to learn how to prioritize those assumptions. Then we have to learn how to run tests that are small enough that they're just testing that assumption.

(44:51):
This is all critical because it's what makes continuous discovery sustainable. I tell people to work with three ideas at once, and teams are struggling to test even a single idea. So how's that sustainable? Well, that team that's struggling to test a single idea is still stuck in project-based research world. They're running experiments that take weeks to get results.

(45:13):
Whereas when I talk about assumption testing, I'm working with a team that's running half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week, and those assumptions span three ideas. At the end of the week, they can start to compare and contrast those solutions. So we've got to shift our methods. Continuous discovery is sustainable if we change our behavior, if we change our habits.

Lenny (45:36):
For folks that want to learn more about assumption testing, continuous discovery, all the things that you've been chatting about, where can they find you online and find these courses online?

Teresa Torres (45:44):
Yeah. So first I'll mention the book, Continuous Discovery Habits. It's available at bookstores around the world. It's in EPUB, paperback, and Audible. Then I do blog about all of this at producttalk.org and our courses are at learn.producttalk.org.

Lenny (45:57):
Awesome. I also love to ask guests, how can listeners be useful to you?

Teresa Torres (46:01):
Since the book has come out, the reaction has been unbelievably amazing and a lot of fun. And I'm a little bit overwhelmed by people in the industry who have never been exposed to this way of working having a lot of skepticism that it's possible.

(46:17):
So here's how listeners can be helpful. I didn't make up this way of working. This way of working evolved from teams figuring this out. I see it as I'm looking at how do I collect sustainable practices, making it as easy as possible for other teams to work this way?

(46:34):
So I think the way listeners can help me is if you've never been exposed to this and you have healthy skepticism, that's awesome. And just ask yourself, imagine if this worked, imagine if this was possible, because I get really tired having to explain to people there really are teams that work this way. I'm sorry that you've never been exposed to it, but there really are teams that have worked this way. If you've never been exposed to that, go look for it. There's lots of evidence of it on the internet.

Lenny (47:03):
Amazing. I'm hoping our chat helps fight the fight for that changing of minds. Teresa, thank you so much for being here. I had a blast. I learned a lot. Thank you.

Teresa Torres (47:11):
Lenny, thanks so much for having me. This has been fun.

Lenny (47:15):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# A framework for finding product-market fit | Todd Jackson (First Round Capital)

## Transcript

Todd Jackson (00:00:00):
Finding product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years, and it's just underexplored and it's just underexplained as a topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
You've been working on a product-market fit framework.

Todd Jackson (00:00:11):
We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review, and we have found a very consistent set of patterns, demand satisfaction, and efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them from the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
There's essentially four levels of product-market fit: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:00:27):
Roughly, 60% are never going to get past L2.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:29):
These four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck.

Todd Jackson (00:00:34):
You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Hearing level three tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding, selling, pitching.

Todd Jackson (00:00:47):
This is where it starts to get fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
Today my guest is Todd Jackson. Todd is a partner at the legendary VC firm, First Round Capital. I rarely have VCs on this podcast, but as Todd shares at the top of this episode, Todd is a very special VC. Prior to moving into venture, he was product lead for Gmail for four years. He was product manager of Facebook's newsfeed, photos and groups, including leading a major redesign of the newsfeed. He's also a director of product management at Twitter and VP of product and design at Dropbox.

(00:01:21):
He's also a founder and sold his company to Twitter. This episode is a very different and special kind of episode. Todd and the team at First Round have spent the last year looking at all of their data and the journeys of the hundreds of startups that they've worked with over the years. And through that, have put together a very practical and very actionable framework to help founders find product-market fit. They're turning this framework into a three-month program for founders, and in this conversation, Todd shares an exclusive peek into the program, in particular, the stages of product-market fit.

(00:01:55):
We talk about how to know which stage you're in, what to do if you're stuck in that stage, and also what you can change in order to get unstuck. If you're a founder or building a new product within a company and feeling like you're not making as much progress as you'd hope, you will find tremendous value in this conversation. With that, I bring you Todd Jackson after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:02:26):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.

(00:02:56):
WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand. It's an effortless experience from your first user, all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to one million users. Check it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more. That's workos.com/lenny.

(00:03:32):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

(00:04:12):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10 X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny. Todd, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Todd Jackson (00:04:56):
Lenny, I'm excited to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
So first of all, just to mention you're a VC, which is very rare for this podcast. But you're a very special VC, you have a deep background in product, and I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of context on your product background, your product bona fides so people will get a real sense of just how legit you are as a product thinker.

Todd Jackson (00:05:17):
Yeah, you got it. So I am a VC. I'm a partner at First Round Capital now, and I've been at First Round for four years. But I was not a VC before First Round. So I started a company in 2013 called Cover, and that was actually funded by First Round 11 years ago. That's how I got to know First Round. And before that, I had worked on Gmail as the product lead in the early days, early 2000s and at Facebook.

(00:05:39):
And then I started Cover, and we ended up selling Cover to Twitter in 2014. And I worked on a bunch of different products at Twitter. And then I was the VP of product and design at Dropbox. That was 2015 to 2018. So I have always loved product, and that's actually the reason now that I love being a seed stage VC because I love investing at the early stage founders who are pre-product-market fit and then helping them get there. And I just love doing that over and over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:07):
I feel like we could have a whole other podcast episode on why you decided to move into venture versus staying in product.

Todd Jackson (00:06:12):
We can do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):
But we're going to stay focused. So the reason we're here is that for over a year, you've been working on a product-market fit framework, essentially, a framework to help founders and product teams find product-market fit, which we should talk about this. But this is the most important thing you've got to get right as a founder in a product team is finding product-market fit. I got a peek at this framework. I love it. I love the way you've structured it, the way you're thinking about it.

(00:06:36):
So what we're going to do today is walk through this framework in depth. First, I just want to spend a few minutes on setting a little context just so people understand who this is for and how to think about this. So maybe a first question is just why do you believe people need a framework for finding product-market fit? And just also, if you want to touch on why is product-market fit so important? Why is that something people should even be thinking about?

Todd Jackson (00:06:57):
The thing about product-market fit is that I find it's mysterious to a lot of people, and people tend to think about it purely as an art rather than a science. And all the advice that you find out there on the internet is very general when it comes to product-market fit. You'll know it when you see it, you'll know it when you have it. It's not specific. And there's so many other startup topics where there is good content on the internet like hiring your first salesperson, running board meetings, stuff that is specific and tactical. But there isn't that much content around product-market fit that is that specific.

(00:07:33):
And so I think that's actually why Rahul from Superhuman is well-known for his approach to finding product-market fit. That was published on the First Round Review in 2018, and it was immediately popular and interesting to people. And I think the reason is because it was specific and because it was tactical and it brought a little bit of the science to something that people thought was just an art. And I think it's why your content is really popular too, Lenny.

(00:07:57):
You and I worked on this product validation article together a little while back, and the seven part series that you did on B2B SaaS companies and the PMF benchmarking data that you had, I think it was how long it took to get to a product and a customer and to product-market fit, that was super well-read. And there just isn't that much good specific content about this. But like you said, product-market fit is the single most important thing that your startup does in the first three years and it's just underexplored, it's underexplained as a topic.

(00:08:28):
So we felt this was a very important thing to do, something worth focusing on. And I've personally talked to hundreds of founders about this topic. We've published dozens of articles on the First Round Review. We call this our Paths to Product-Market Fit Series where we interview founders about the early days. And I'm just always interested in what are the patterns. If you talk to enough successful founders, and in this case, it can be enterprise founders, and you ask them, "What did you do in the first six to nine months of running your company, of starting your company? What patterns emerged from that?" And we have found a very consistent set of patterns, and that's what we decided to base our framework around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):
Amazing. And I think you're at such an interesting Venn diagram of exposure to develop something like this. One, you have a deep product background, you started a company, you see tons of startups going through the journey, many succeeding, many not. So I get why one, you wanted to do this and why I think this is going to be so valuable to a lot of people. You talked briefly about why product-market fit is so important, and maybe it might be helpful just to share a little bit more just why is this something people should be so obsessed with and why did you spend so much time developing this?

Todd Jackson (00:09:40):
I think as a founder, there are so many things you have to do. You have to pick a market, you have to find a co-founder, you have to hire a team, you have to raise funding, you have to build a product, you have to sell a product. And so sometimes it gets lost that actually, the only thing that matters in the first couple years is finding product-market fit and actually, what we define as extreme product-market fit, and I'll go into that. Because if you find extreme product-market fit, the momentum just carries you, and the market pulls you along. And it's easy to know what to build because you're building the thing that your customers want and it's motivating as a team. It's easy to hire people, everything becomes easier if you find product-market fit, it is the thing that propels the company.

(00:10:25):
And so we are a seed stage venture firm. We tend to work with very early founders who are pre-product-market fit. And the hard truth about it is that most of them don't get past the first couple levels of it. The majority of startups do not get past, what we call, level one product-market fit or level two product-market fit. And I'll go through and define all that stuff. They get stuck at one of those first couple levels. And if they can unlock the right product and the right way to explain it to a customer and make a customer deeply satisfied, and there's enough customers out there like that, it just pulls the whole thing along.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
Who is this framework for specifically? And for people that are listening, how do they know if this is for them or not?

Todd Jackson (00:11:07):
This is for early B2B founders, and specifically founders who are doing something that is more sales-led than bottom-up. I think bottom-up is its own world. It's closer to consumer product development in my mind. And I have done consumer products. Consumer product, I think there is a little bit more alchemy involved. It's about having great taste and finding the right thing at the right time and it's like catching lightning in a bottle.

(00:11:36):
I think the good thing about enterprise, and specifically sales-led B2B, is that there is more science to it. And so it is for sales-led B2B founders who are in, let's call it, the first six to nine months of starting their company and want to set the foundation for product-market fit right from the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):
Awesome. Okay. So B2B founders, sales-led in the first six to nine months of their journey. Awesome.

Todd Jackson (00:11:59):
That's right. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
You talked about the science of this. I imagine you don't want to overpromise this is going to help you find product-market fit, step one, two, three profit. How do you think about just what the benefits of this are and how people should think about the chance that they will find product-market fit at the end of this journey following this framework?

Todd Jackson (00:12:16):
We can't guarantee success here. I just want to contextualize that finding extreme product-market fit is very, very hard. And what we are trying to do is increase your odds, increase the odds, reduce the role of luck, give you a framework and way of thinking about the things that you need to do. And I think that that can increase the odds. Like I said earlier, the majority of startups are getting stuck at these first couple levels. I think if you know what the path looks like and you know what the levers are at your disposal and you know what you need to aim for, I think we can get more of these companies to level three and level four product-market fit, which is where you really want to be and where you have a very valuable company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:54):
Perfect. Okay, final question. You launched a whole program for founders to go through and learn all of this in depth, many week kind of program. We're going to be covering a lot of it here for folks that want to go a lot deeper and actually go through this program. Talk about how they find this and how this program works.

Todd Jackson (00:13:11):
So we launched a new program, and we call it Product-Market Fit Method. It is designed, like I said, to help early B2B founders increase the odds of finding product-market fit. It's totally free, it's a very intensive program. You can see all the details at pmf.firstround.com, and the application deadline is May 7th. The program starts on May 29th. And we actually ran a beta version, a test version of this late last year with 11 founders, I think probably some you know, Lenny, from Stripe and Plaid and Airbnb and Twitter. And the feedback, it was great. It made me feel very good.

(00:13:47):
One of the founders was like, "I feel like these 14 weeks saved me two years of time in what would've been wandering through the desert." And so there's eight sessions in the full program, and the first one is the one we're going to do today. So the first session is on what we call the levels of product-market fit. The second one is on customer discovery, and we actually refer to it as dollar-driven discovery. We get very specific about not just the normal way of doing customer conversations and customer discovery, but how do you find that a customer is willing to pay money for this thing and a lot of money?

(00:14:22):
We talk about market validation, product positioning. We do a section on design partners because I think a lot of founders have questions about that. How do I find the right design partners? What's the right way to structure an agreement with them? How do I convert them to paying customers? All that stuff. We talk about product iteration and pivots, and I refer to this stage as the grind, the grind of product iteration. And then we spend a ton of time on founder-led sales.

(00:14:47):
And the reason that we do that is we really like working with very technical founders, builders, people that are either engineering background, product design, data science, people who are builders. So that's the program in a nutshell. And like I said, any founder working on a new B2B SaaS company, welcome to apply. And then bonus points if you are technical, like I said, if you have a clear product idea or a hypothesis, but that you're less than six to 12 months into building the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
I love how incentives are so aligned here. You help companies find product-market fit. If First Round does great, everyone does great. It makes so much sense to build something like this. One thing I can't help but mention or ask about is you said it's an intensive program. How do you find founders have time to do something like this and also be building their company? I know this helps them build, but how do you just think about they have so much to do, they have time to do a program like this?

Todd Jackson (00:15:41):
The way that we think about it is that the program roughly takes about 10 hours a week for each founder, and it's 10 hours of work that you were going to be doing anyway. It is literally you're talking to customers, you're improving your positioning, you're doing critical thinking about your market and what you should be building. And so the way I think about it, and the way I've heard from the 11 founders that went through it is it just added structure to what I was doing anyway and it actually made me more efficient.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):
Last question, you mentioned that it's free. How does that work? How does that work for everyone?

Todd Jackson (00:16:14):
So it's 100% free and literally, it costs you $0. We give you $0, we own 0% of your company. And it's pretty different than I think a lot of other programs out there. And this is just something we do. Over the years, we've run First Round Angel Track, which I know you were in, Lenny. We've run the First Round Review for 10 years. We make these things free and our belief is that you have to create value in the ecosystem.

(00:16:36):
You have to put stuff out in the world that is useful, and if you can create that value, create enough value with the audience, then you'll be able to capture that value at some point. And so we think there's a win-win here. We get an inside look at some of tomorrow's great companies and they get an inside look at First Round.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:49):
Got it. So companies don't have to take money from you guys to be a part of this program.

Todd Jackson (00:16:53):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
Okay, let's get into it. Let's talk about this framework. Maybe just as a broad strokes overview, how does this framework work? How do companies find product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:17:03):
So the framework starts with a very simple idea that is product-market fit is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and it doesn't just happen overnight. And for B2B companies, specifically, it does tend to follow a repeatable pattern. And so we start with defining the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to get to extreme product-market fit. And we have a precise definition for this. Let me read it to you. So extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.

(00:17:40):
And so there's three key ideas in there: demand, satisfaction and efficiency. And I think efficiency is worth highlighting because that's what most people would leave out of their definition. You talk about like, "Oh, it's a product, people like it. That's good, that's product-market fit." But if you look, there's products out there. I was a big fan of WeWork, as a customer of WeWork. And I'm a fan of Casper and these other products. Those products managed to achieve customer satisfaction and demand, but they never got the efficiency right, and so the whole business just never worked at scale.

(00:18:18):
And my partner, Brett Berson, at First Round, he gives this example of the $100 vending machine, and I really like this example, which is imagine I built a vending machine and I stuck it in the middle of San Francisco. And you walk up to this vending machine and you put a dollar in and $100 bill comes out. And that's the product. That would have insane demand. There would be a line at that vending machine. I think people would be extremely satisfied. They'd be like, "This is awesome." The retention would be very good. I'm sure they would come back tomorrow. But the whole thing is it's ridiculous. The whole metaphor is ridiculous because it's just not viable to do something like that.

(00:18:59):
And yet you see a lot of startups kind of do this. They're basically with their products, giving away $2 for $1 and it gets them pretty far. But that's not real product-market fit. And so that's one of the reasons that we think efficiency and how you think about the economic model of what you're doing is very important. And then this other aspect that I like, which is we have this concept that we call the marginal customer, and the next incremental customer you're going to get for your company, for your product. And if you have product-market fit, and as you are progressing along this journey, the marginal customer should be getting easier and easier and easier to get, easier to acquire them, easier to give them good service with a good product.

(00:19:42):
And that means your efficiency is increasing along the way and your product-market fit is strengthening. So you've got to have all three of those things: demand, satisfaction, efficiency. But the interesting thing is that you don't go for all three of them at once from the very beginning. And so product-market fit, it happens in the sequence of levels, it happens over multiple years. And for the best enterprise companies, I would say they tend to reach extreme product-market fit in roughly four to six years. There's some variance, but roughly four to six years. And so we label these four levels. We say level one product-market fit is nascent product-market fit. Level two is developing, level three is strong, and level four is extreme. And that's where you want to get.

(00:20:26):
And along the way, you're trading off these three dimensions: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency because they're intertwined. You could spend a bunch of money on marketing, and that's going to increase your demand, but you're decreasing your efficiency if you do that. You can invest a bunch in efficiency and automating a whole bunch of stuff, but that actually might harm the customer experience and you're reducing satisfaction. So that's an interesting thing, I think, is you're actually making trade-offs at each level and what you should optimize for at each level is different. And so we talk about all these signs, whether you're getting stuck at a given level, how do you get unstuck and how do you progress along this path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
Amazing. And we're going to go through each of these. And the idea, as a listener, what I'm thinking is you're probably in one of these buckets. What we're trying to do is help you out of that bucket and help you move further up the ladder to the next level. So just to summarize, I have my notes here. So there's essentially four levels of product-market fit, basically, the strength of product-market fit that you have: nascent, developing, strong, extreme.

Todd Jackson (00:21:24):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:25):
Okay. And then you have three dimensions within each of these levels: satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. We're going to talk about what all these mean and how you use these. Let's talk about level one, nascent product-market fit. What does that look like? What do you do when you're there if you're stuck? And what are some examples of companies that felt nascent product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:21:44):
Yeah. Okay, level one, nascent. So at this point, you're probably like a pre-seed or seed stage company. You've got less than 10 people on your team. And at level one, your job is to find three to five customers that have a particular problem that is worth solving and to deliver them a satisfying solution. And you got to pick a problem that is both important and urgent to them.

(00:22:08):
And the solution that you deliver needs to satisfy some kind of promise that they care deeply about. So of the three dimensions that you just recapped, Lenny, it's satisfaction first, demand second, efficiency last when you're at level one. It's actually okay to be inefficient at this stage if it helps you uncover something that delivers an insanely good customer satisfaction. And so I think that one of the best examples I can think of that is this company called Vanta.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
Love Vanta. Also, a happy sponsor and I'm an investor. What a great example.

Todd Jackson (00:22:42):
What a great example. So Vanta was founded in 2016 by Christina Cacioppo, and she had come from Dropbox and we got to work at Dropbox together, which was awesome. She was the PM of Dropbox Paper at that time. And so Vanta, it's a company that does compliance automation, continuous monitoring. And most startups think of Vanta is how you get a SOC 2, but they didn't do that at first.

(00:23:03):
And I remember in 2018, Christina and I went on a walk around the South Park neighborhood in San Francisco. And this was the first time I heard the idea of Vanta. And she had actually, in 2016, 2017, tried a few other ideas. She had this smart speaker that would record meetings and it would send meeting summaries over Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):
B2B Alexa is what she called it. I remember.

Todd Jackson (00:23:25):
B2B Alexa. And she had this other idea, something about dropshipping, but she didn't know anything about dropshipping. And she had just been in this mode of like, "We're building stuff and then we're seeing if anybody wants it." And then she realized that wasn't working and she changed what she was doing. And she started talking to potential customers, and she was very interested in the idea of security and why a lot of startups didn't use any security products.

(00:23:48):
And she was talking to security engineers and CISOs and just CTOs and startups. And she would ask them, "What is the thing you hate most about your job as it relates to security?" And over and over and over they would say, "I hate filling out the security questionnaires. I hate doing the compliance audits. It's so much grungy manual work. I'm in there filling out spreadsheets and taking screenshots of my AWS account. And the whole thing just doesn't make sense." And she had actually felt this herself when she was on Dropbox Paper and the experience of getting a SOC 2 was onerous.

(00:24:26):
And the reason that she needed to get it is because we wanted to start selling Dropbox Paper into enterprise. And so she said to me, "There's this pain out there, I think I can solve it, and I think there might be a revenue unlock." And I was like, "What do you mean by that?" And she was like, "Well, I've got these first few customers or design partner, pseudo customers. It's Segment and Front and Figma." And this is 2017, '18. So these companies were smaller at the time, not the big companies they are now. And she was like, "Yeah, they're trying to sell into Fortune 500 companies. One of them is actually trying to land a Fortune 10 right now. And they said the thing that's holding them back is they don't have compliance certification, they don't have a SOC 2.

(00:25:08):
"And I told them, 'Hey, what if I do that for you?' And they were like, 'Oh, you can just do that?'" And she was like, "Yeah." And she did it, and they landed the deal. And it's one of the clearest examples to me of a product that satisfies a promise, but this product is going to unlock revenue for you. You are going to be able to land this enterprise deal. And so I think they just did a phenomenal job of that. And that's what you're looking for when you're at level one, a problem that really matters to three to five customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
That specific example, I think she delivered a spreadsheet. There was no product, she just manually filled out a spreadsheet and gave it to them.

Todd Jackson (00:25:49):
Completely manual. She was the one behind the email address posing as the AI, but doing it herself. And I think that's revealing of it's okay to be inefficient at level one, as long as you are delivering incredible satisfaction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Yeah, I was just going to say that. This is the ultimate example of efficiency is not important, which I love, is what you're pointing out at this step. I know you're going to share another example, but just to summarize what this stage feels like from earlier when you talked about, essentially, of less than 10 people, you're trying to find three to five customers. I think that's so important. You're not trying to find tens or hundreds, you're just like, "Three to five people." And the customer element, I imagine, you're implying they're paying you money.

Todd Jackson (00:26:29):
Yes, they're paying you money and you're delivering a product that solves a problem for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):
And the product could be potentially a spreadsheet or super Wizard of Oz at this point even.

Todd Jackson (00:26:37):
Yeah, that's okay at this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):
I know RAMP actually had barely a product when they started selling. Initially, they had someone just updating things behind the scenes on these dashboards. And then you talked about the problem needs to be important and urgent, which connects to people paying attention to a startup that they don't trust or know anything about because the problem is that important and urgent. And you also mentioned it has to satisfy a promise you're giving them, "We'll solve SOC 2 for you," and then you actually accomplish that.

Todd Jackson (00:27:03):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):
Is there anything else maybe as a benchmark that tells you you're at this step of product-market fit?

Todd Jackson (00:27:10):
Yeah. So like I said, you're pre-seed less than 10 people. Probably, your demand source at this stage is mostly people you know. It's friends and family, it's your network, maybe it's VCs. You haven't probably done a lot of cold outreach at this point, and it's hard to find customers. You're trying to get three to five. It probably takes you 20 warm intros to get one, something along those lines. So maybe to get to three to five, it's at least 50 conversations. That's very normal at this stage because you're just trying to find the right problem and find customers who have it. You're probably in the $0 to 500K ARR, somewhere in that zone. I would say that you're at level one.

(00:27:48):
And then there are metrics to track efficiency, things like burn multiple, gross margin, NRR all of these things. All of them are just not applicable at this stage. It's too early and you shouldn't be worrying about that stuff. And so you want to be feeling this sense of progress that there are customers who need what you are building and the thing you're building works. And so conversely, the signs that we see a lot of founders get stuck, and this is a very common level to get stuck. And so if you're hanging out here for six months, nine months, 12 months, and there's yellow flags that are appearing, you're starting to feel stuck.

(00:28:24):
And so the yellow flags are something like, let's say, your product disappeared overnight, your customers wouldn't be super disappointed. Let's say you have a handful of happy customers. Let's say you've got four or five customers, but the most important feature is actually different for each one of them. That starts to look a little bit more like a consulting business than a product business. Or it just feels incredibly hard to find the marginal customer, the next new customer. Or your usage is low. The product is in their hands, but the usage is low, it's not growing that much. It lasts for six months.

(00:28:55):
And I think, there's a really good example, Jack Altman, who's the founder of Lattice, he founded Lattice in 2015. We've talked to him a bunch on the First Round Paths to Product-Market Fit and other things. So for those who don't know, Lattice is a people management platform, but it didn't start that way. And most people don't know about this, Lattice actually started as an OKR tool back in 2015.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:15):
Oh, didn't know.

Todd Jackson (00:29:16):
Yeah. And so Jack had just seen this at other companies. He's like, "Okay, companies are doing OKRs, but they're not very good at it and it causes a lot of arguments among the executive team and employees are noncompliant. They think the whole thing's dumb. So I can fix that with software." And so the original version of Lattice was for managing OKRs. And he was able to sell it. And so his buyer was the head of HR, and they said, "Okay, yeah, we'll give this a shot." And he had a couple companies using it, and they would use it for one quarter. And then the next quarter would come around, and they were like, "Didn't go that well last time. I don't know, the employees don't seem to like it. I don't know."

(00:29:59):
And then the quarter after that, they were like, "No, we're not buying this, we're not using this." And so Jack pulled off the pivot to people management. And the way that he did it was he actually kept the persona. And so this gets into the ideas of the four Ps, and I'll talk about this a little bit more. This is our version of the four Ps. You've got the persona, the problem, the promise, and the product. And all four of these things have to line up. Your product has to deliver a promise that solves the problem of your persona. And so Jack actually kept the persona. He was like, "I've gotten to know these heads of HR really well over the last six to nine months. I text with them, I go out to coffee with them, I'm friends with them, I know them really well. This OKR thing just doesn't seem to be a big deal for them, but they've got other problems that I could look at solving."

(00:30:53):
And the interesting thing was that timing, it was mid-2010s, performance management had started to come back in favor. It was like this pendulum. There was a period of time where performance management was really important, and then all these companies were like, "We're not doing this anymore." And then the pendulum swung back, and around 2015, 2016 was that time. And so Jack literally showed them Figma mock-ups. There was no product, but he's like, "What if I could solve performance management for you in a way that is much more modern and much more employee-friendly and manager-friendly and the whole thing's just going to work better?"

(00:31:25):
And the response was off the charts. And people wanted this thing. And I believe he sold his first five or 10 customers with Figma mock-ups. Before, he hadn't built anything really. And so that, I think, is an interesting example of he was stuck in the zone of people didn't love what he was doing. He kept the persona, but he changed the problem that he was solving and the promise he was delivering through the product. And we do a whole section on pivots and when to pivot and how to pivot. And I think this is actually the best framework for this, is the four Ps. Lattice kept the first one but changed the others. Vanta changed all four.

(00:32:08):
There are other products like Plaid that actually kept elements of the product they were doing. So I don't know if you know the story of Plaid, but Zach Perret was building... Plaid started out not as like a API for bank accounts. It started out as a consumer budgeting app. It was a consumer app. And it just was supposed to help you save money and budget and stuff. And it just wasn't that popular. And the founders were frustrated, but they had built this part of the product that enabled the app to connect to your bank accounts, and had solved all the nitty-gritty issues with that. And then they found that their friends wanted to license it from them.

(00:32:46):
So Zach had a friend at Venmo who wanted to license this, and they got Robinhood at some point, they got Coinbase at some point. So that's an example of they actually kept a lot of the code that they had written. They kept the product, but they completely changed the other three Ps. Instead of solving for consumers who have a problem with budgeting, we are going to solve for developers at fintech companies who have a problem connecting to bank accounts. And it was a total flip of the four Ps. But that's why I really like this framework because I think it really helps founders think in a structured way about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
Todd, this is amazing. I'm so happy we're doing this. I think this is going to help a lot of people. I want to move on to level two, but first let me try to summarize some of these key elements. So these four Ps is essentially what you should try to change if you're stuck in this level or any level. And just to summarize, you can change who you're targeting, the persona, you can change the problem you're solving, you could change the way you're pitching it, which is the promise is how you describe it, basically positioning. And then you could also just change your product. You mentioned Vanta changed all four, some companies change just one. Any advice for how to know which of these to change? What points you to change this versus change that? Is there anything that you've seen?

Todd Jackson (00:33:55):
I think different founders approach this differently. And I've seen a lot of founders who are build first and then sell, and I've seen a lot of founders who are sell first and then build. And they can both work. I tend to gravitate towards the, "I want to sell it before I build it," because I really want the signal from customers and I want that to be the guide and the oxygen that drives what I'm building. I find that very motivating. I also find it easier, honestly.

(00:34:25):
Rather than guessing like, "Oh, I'm going to write 50,000 lines of code and then see if somebody wants this thing," I think it's better to talk to a bunch of customers, know that, "Hey, if I had this thing, if I could build this thing, I know it would sell. I know these people want this thing." So I tend to approach it from that point of view and therefore, I focus on the persona and the problem and the promise. What is the promise that is really going to click for that buyer, for that persona? And then the product's job is to satisfy those first three Ps really.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:55):
And obviously, those are much easier to change and play with versus rebuilding your product. So if nothing else, you should probably start there. I actually have a post with a bunch of awesome examples of changing the positioning, changing the persona, and so we'll link to that in show notes if people want more examples. Finally, let me try to summarize the stage. So I think it's important to note at this nascent stage, it's not roaring product-market fit. It's, as you described, very nascent. You're getting customers, but it's hard. You said it's 20 introductions to one sale, but you're getting them.

(00:35:25):
I know Retool has a great quote. David has this quote of, "Every customer he got early on, he felt it was the last customer he was ever going to get. No more people want this thing and it's always a struggle." So I think that's very normal, is what you're describing. The beginnings are rarely off and to the right. And it's okay if this takes a while. You said that if you spent 12 months at this stage, you're probably stuck in the stage, and signs that you're stuck in this nascent stage versus this is actually normal. Signs you mentioned are if you ask people if this went away and they wouldn't be disappointed, they'd be like, "Nah, all right. It's cool."

(00:36:01):
You have many customers, but they're using different features of the product. So to you, the way you described it, essentially, you're professional services for them. You're not actually building a product. You consult a lot of people. And then they're actually not using it often. They're buying, they're paying for it, like the last example, but they're not necessarily using it and they're going to churn pretty quickly.

Todd Jackson (00:36:19):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):
Anything else you wanted to touch on there before we get to level two?

Todd Jackson (00:36:23):
The last thing that I'd add at level one is there's this founder from a company called Persona, his name is Rick Song. He's super awesome. Persona is a First Round company. They do identity verification. And Rick's analogy, I just love it for level one, is you don't want to get friend-zoned by your customers, where your customers like you, but they don't love you and they don't need you. And he was super paranoid about this in the early days of Persona. And his technique for doing this, which I really like, is super simple, was he was very close with his first five or 10 customers.

(00:37:00):
And he would go to them and sit them down one-on-one and say, "I need your help. It is very important to me that this company succeeds and does not fail. So I don't want you to be nice to me. I want you to tell me is Persona a necessity for your company? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor came along that charged half as much as us, would you switch to them?" And he's really trying to get to the essence of: is Persona critical for you or am I in the friend zone? And I just think that's a really great way of thinking about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
I love that story. It's like in a relationship, it's the talk.

Todd Jackson (00:37:37):
It's the talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
"Are we a thing?" I love that. That's so good. The sooner you know the truth, the better. And it's hard to hear bad news, but I love that, just advice of just sit them down one-on-one. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying, "Want to take a tour?" "Check out this new feature." And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible.

(00:38:08):
But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent. So they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions.

(00:38:36):
And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. Let's talk about level two. So what does level two look like? And what should founders be focusing on when they're in level two?

Todd Jackson (00:39:19):
Yeah. So level two is developing product-market fit, and your job at level two is now you've got to go from five satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers. And so now you've got to start thinking about demand in addition to satisfaction. Because it is very hard to just grind your way all the way to 25 customers with sheer willpower, but you can do that to five, maybe 10. And we see some founders who just have phenomenal willpower and grit and grind their way to five or 10 customers. To get to 25 and to get beyond 25, the product has to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you. And so that is the essence of this level.

(00:39:58):
So if you're at this level, now you're seed or Series A style company, maybe you've got up to 20 people at the company. And you're starting to work on this demand source where you have the early signs of a scalable channel, and it's not just warm intros from your VCs or from your friends. You're maybe investing in cold outreach and getting that tuned and humming. You might be investing in content, you might be doing community events, but the whole idea is you're trying to scale the demand source. It's still not easy. A benchmark, we would say, is that your sales conversion without a warm intro is still probably 10%, something like that.

(00:40:38):
First call to close one is around 10%. If you get higher than that, that's great, but that sort of benchmark for this level. You're in anywhere from the 500K to five million ARR zone, that's a hallmark of level two. And you're actually starting to think about efficiency metrics and sales metrics. You might starting to be thinking about magic number, which is a new ARR that you take in in a period divided by the CAC you spend in that period, so something in the 0.5 to 0.75 range. You want to get higher eventually, but that's pretty reasonable for this level.

(00:41:10):
You're just starting to think about retention. You've been around for a year, so you've got renewals and you want those renewals renewing. Maybe something like 10%, 20% regretted churn is okay. You don't want to be higher than that, and you want your NRR to be at least 100%. And then things like gross margin and burn multiple, they're still not the focus. Those are the classic efficiency metrics. They're not the focus right now.

(00:41:30):
But we would say you want your gross margin to be not worse than 50%, and you'd want your burn multiple to be not worse than five X. Your burn multiple, by the way, is just how much you burn in a current period versus how much new ARR comes in. So if you burn $5 million and you take in one, then you've got to burn multiple of five. And you don't want to be worse than that at this stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:51):
Amazing. There's a lot of these benchmarks which I love. I imagine not everyone's going to hit each of them exactly. These are just rough guidelines of like, "You're probably in this stage if you're in this level," right?

Todd Jackson (00:42:03):
Yeah, exactly. There's some wide bars around these metrics. It's just representative of, generally, the stage of five to 25 customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
I love it. And it's so interesting that people think of product-market fit, as you said, as this binary, "I have it or I don't." And the way you're talking about this is in this level to developing product-market fit, a company has 25 satisfied customers, they're over five million in ARR, a lot of cases they have 20 employees.

Todd Jackson (00:42:28):
Between 500K and five million. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):
500K and five million. They have 20 employees. In theory, you would think this is a roaring success. They're killing it, they have all these customers, they're growing. But it's still just level two of product-market fit. So I think this has a really interesting insight, and it reminds me of when I did a bunch of research on product-market fit.

(00:42:49):
So many founders are like, "I never felt that product-market fit. I didn't have it. It was always, 'I don't know, maybe when we get to 100 million ARR, I'll really feel like we got this.'" So I think this is a really good reminder that a lot of times you're not actually going to feel so confident this will last, and you're going to get to lasting durable product-market fit. So I think that's a really great insight here.

Todd Jackson (00:43:12):
Yeah. And the thing that's really, I think, the hallmark of level two is you've got a product that a handful of people like. It's satisfying a critical need for them. Now you've got to open the demand floodgates so that we can get to 25 customers and beyond. And different companies do this in very different ways. It's much easier said than done. Looker is an example. So Looker is a First Round company founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb. They do business intelligence. And Looker is interesting because they spent actually a long time at level one, but then flew through level two. And the reason is because Lloyd, the founder, the first five customers of Looker, he was basically going in and doing consulting for them.

(00:43:59):
And the reason is because of the nature of the product. People don't get Looker until they see their own data in it, and their data is modeled and they see the dashboards and they're like, "Oh, my God. Wow, I didn't realize these insights." So Lloyd understood Looker is not a product you could sell with Figma mock-ups. And so what happened was Lloyd would go into these customers, spend 20, 30, 40 hours before they were even a customer, modeling their data, teaching them how to use it, showing more people within the organization the power of the data and the dashboards.

(00:44:32):
And later, they called this their forward deploy process. This is how they figured out sales. And so it actually took them a long time in level one to get this right, but then they were able to do this repeatably. And so they went from five to 25 fairly quickly, and a lot of amazing... 75% close rate because they were only selling customers who were already using it. There was zero churn. And Lloyd explains once he got to 20 customers, he's like, "I know I'm onto something. And I think I figured out a model."

(00:45:03):
And the model stayed the same until they ended up selling to Google. And so they did these other things too. They started focusing on demand channels. They got a couple SDRs who were prospecting. I think they did some partner marketing with AWS Redshift. They did these look-and-tell customer events in San Francisco where they got Looker customers together to talk about what they were doing in Looker and how they built the product. But really, the groundwork was set at level one and then they moved really quickly through level two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:32):
So again, the way to think about this phase, is this is when you're starting to scale a way to drive demand. You're not just grinding sales, cold outreach. There's a way you're starting to bring in customers that are more efficient. And in Looker's case, they just started coming because I imagine there's word of mouth and people started to talk about it.

Todd Jackson (00:45:50):
Yeah. Let me do another example. A really different example is a company called Ironclad. Ironclad, it's legal. It's a legal tech company founded in 2015. Jason Jason Boehmig is the founder. AI-powered contract management software. So this was interesting because Jason, he started out calling this an AI legal assistant. And in 2024, people are like, "Oh, AI legal assistant. Yeah, that's awesome." But in 2014, people were like, "What?" And he found it really hard to sell. No one was looking for an AI legal assistant. And so he told us this story.

(00:46:29):
There was an email address on the Ironclad homepage, hello@ironclad.com. This is in 2015. And he doesn't get very much email, but Jason is checking the email. And one day he gets this one line email, and he almost archives it because he doesn't know who it's from and it's one line. But he sees that it's from a person at a publicly-traded company, and so he's like, "Oh, maybe there's something here." And the one line email is just, "Are you a CLM?" And he was like, "What is a CLM?" And he Googles for it. A CLM is a contract lifecycle management platform. And he's reading up about CLMs, and he's like, "Oh, we do that. Yeah."

(00:47:08):
And so he replies to the email, "Yes, we are a CLM." And the customer gets them on the phone. And the customer says, "Oh, I'm in the market for a CLM. I'm looking at 10 or 12 different vendors, but you guys look pretty cool because there's some automation and some AI stuff going on. Can I check this out?" And Jason's like, "Of course." So he and his co-founder take the train from San Francisco down to San Jose. And on the train, Jason is telling his co-founder, Cai, "Hey, I need you to code this up right now to make it look like what this customer is expecting."

(00:47:42):
And they get to the meeting, and they do the demo. And the customer has no idea that they just made this demo on the train, and they're a very small company. And they win the contract against these 10 or 12 other established bases, because Ironclad, it's more modern, it's automated, it's got this AI stuff. It's just a better product, or the demo looks like it's going to be a better product. And so Jason reflects on this and he's like, "Yeah, the thing for us is we had been trying to create this new category of AI legal assistant, and it was just a slog.

(00:48:10):
"And instead, when we changed our positioning to play in an existing category of CLM, but a much better CLM, but customers are already looking for a CLM, they're already looking to spend money on a CLM, and just expand the definition of what that category is, things just started to click." And that's how they got through that zone of 10, 20, 30 customers. And even if you look at the Ironclad website today, it says AI-Powered Contract Management Software. That really is the key idea still.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):
Awesome. So this is an awesome example of positioning/promise is the lever they pull here. I love the point about category design. That's one of the ongoing debates on this podcast, whether you should try to create a category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:50):
I know, it's a hot topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):
Hot topic. Sounds like you're in the boat of probably better not to create your own category.

Todd Jackson (00:48:56):
I think it's hard to create a category. It certainly works in some cases, but if you actually have a really interesting spin on an existing category, there's already buyers spending money on that thing. They're already looking for something to buy. So if you can do it, I do actually think that way is easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):
Before we get to level three, what are signs that you're maybe stuck at level two, and what should one do about that?

Todd Jackson (00:49:21):
Yeah. So the whole idea of level two is this thing that the marginal customer is getting easier. And so you've got to be focusing on demand and the repeatability of demand while you maintain satisfaction. So the yellow flags are things that are the opposite of that. Your current customers are pretty happy, but you're just having trouble opening the floodgates. As you're getting to the top end of level two, you should start to hear some startups know who you are like, "Oh, you need a SOC 2, you're a startup. Oh, Vanta." "Oh, you need AI-powered contract management software. Oh, Ironclad." You start to get known for a thing.

(00:49:59):
And so if you're having trouble opening those floodgates, and you're sitting there for, I don't know, 12 months, 18 months, that's a problem. Or you have things like your regretted churn is greater than 20%. That's a satisfaction warning sign. And again, you have to maintain the satisfaction as you work on these other things. Every level just gets more things you have to do. Or you could be finding that the sales cycle's taking too long, you're losing deals late in the funnel, you're losing the competitors. You're just not feeling the urgency from customers or you're struggling to hit the price point that you want.

(00:50:33):
And the way that customers will say this to you because customers are nice, right? They'll say, "Oh, we don't have the budget." Or, "Oh, it's just not the right time for us. We'd love to talk again next year." That means no, when you're hearing that from customers. You want customers who are like, "Oh, of course. Yeah, this is expensive, but I'm going to make this work because I need this." And so if you're seeing any of those signs, those are the signs that you maybe are stuck or plateauing at this level. And I really think it's important to think about the four Ps and think about: how am I going to pivot my way out of this? Jack Altman, who I mentioned earlier from Lattice, he's got a great quote on this.

(00:51:14):
It's up in a video on the website. What did he say? He said, "Most founders do a 10% pivot, and what they need to be doing is a 200% pivot." Jack didn't say this, but I think part of my interpretation of this is it's psychologically hard as a founder. You've gotten to this many customers, you're starting to plateau, but you're like, "I don't want to throw this whole thing away." But you have to be willing to let go and really focus on nailing the four Ps at this point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
And in your experience, do you find, essentially, pivoting is the answer if you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (00:51:52):
I think sometimes it's nice when it's the Ironclad thing, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:56):
Yeah.

Todd Jackson (00:51:57):
It's nicest when it's the Looker thing of you don't have to change anything. It just starts working and basically, the whole thing works the whole time. That's not common. It's nice when it's the Ironclad thing when you just change one of them, or maybe two of them. Starting over with all four of these is hard at level two, but oftentimes, it's what's required. I was mentioning earlier, level two is the second most common level to get stuck.

(00:52:20):
A big chunk of companies are going to get stuck at level one, and the second biggest is at level two. So sometimes it's hard. I think the trap is not doing enough to realize that you're actually not progressing to product-market fit in the way that you need to and just starting to burn money and not make progress. And you've seen many startups struggle with this. I think it's the hardest part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):
Yeah. Especially once they're a million, two million, three million ARR and they're like, "Look, we're making all this money." And they don't necessarily realize that they've been stuck at this stage for so long. So just to summarize flags that something is wrong and that you should probably think about changing your persona, your problem, your promise or your product, is it's been 12 to 18 months at this stage of product-market fit. You are churning about 20% of customers. And these are logo churn, I imagine, just like businesses stop using you.

Todd Jackson (00:53:14):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:14):
Your sales cycles are really slow. Is there a sense of what slow means? Just a rough heuristic. What should it...

Todd Jackson (00:53:20):
Well, some sales cycles are slow. If you're selling to companies that are big, you're selling to government, that type of thing. I don't know. Rough rule of thumb is... There's different ACVs also. If you're the kind of product that is 20K, 30K annual contracts, that was Looker, right? But they were able to do the sales cycle very repeatedly because they closed so often. There are some contracts that are 100K, 200K, six figure contracts. Those can take a long time. Those can take three to six months. You can't basically be in the worst of both worlds where you've got a slow sales cycle and a low ACV. That is the quadrant of death basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Awesome. Okay. And then the other sign is just you're not finding demand starting to come to you. You're not finding a channel to drive demand. And is a big part of this inbound? You're supposed to start seeing more inbound coming at you? Or is it more just sales becomes easier?

Todd Jackson (00:54:12):
It's both. So sales becomes easier, but I think if you are starting to get to level three, which is where we're getting to next, you've probably got 10%, 20% of your inbound coming or completely organic inbound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):
Awesome. Okay. So again, if you're stuck at this stage, and these are signs that are like, "Oh, man, this sounds familiar," your advice is find one of these things to shift the person you're going after, the problem you're solving, the way you position it and/or your product if you have to.

Todd Jackson (00:54:41):
Yeah. And probably just look for something that is a lot more of a burning pain. It's usually that the problem is not significant enough, important enough to people, or the promise is not valuable enough. It's usually one of those [inaudible 00:54:54] assuming you have a reasonable persona.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:56):
Awesome. And the reason I am spending so much time here, as you said, most companies get stuck here, like B2B SaaS companies. So I think it's really important to make sure people have something to go with. And in the course and in the post you put out, there's more examples of companies going through this and what they did. Let's talk about level three. What does level three look like? What should you be focusing on there?

Todd Jackson (00:55:16):
Yeah. So level three is strong product-market fit. This is where I think it starts to get fun. This is where all the product-market fit adages come in, "The fish are jumping into the boat. The rock is rolling down the hill and I'm trying to chase it instead of pushing it up the hill." And keep in mind, for most enterprise founders, we're now three, four or five years into the company, so it's not easy to get here. And to get to L3 here, you are looking for repeatability. The marginal customer has become much easier.

(00:55:48):
And so you mentioned, Lenny, this quote from David Hsu from Retool, which I love too, and I'll read it again. He said, "We talked to someone who said that finding product-market fit was so visceral, you immediately felt it like a geyser." And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years. At Retool, every customer we got, whether that was number four or number 14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt like rolling the stone uphill, and if you stop pushing, it's going to roll back on you and crush you.

(00:56:15):
And that's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR. That's when the boulder went down the other side and we had to chase it to keep up. And you mentioned earlier, founders were like, "I'm not sure I ever felt product-market fit." This is when you start to feel it. And Jack Altman, again, from Lattice said, "The biggest shift was in the ease of getting leads." I remember thinking, "I don't even know where these leads are coming from, just more and more of them are showing up each month."

(00:56:43):
But that is a great feeling. That is a great feeling. Filip Kaliszan from Verkada, he's in some of the videos on our website too. His quote, I'll read it, was, "After our first year of sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up with production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to happen in the span of 12 to 18 months in order to deliver on everything that customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. And that in itself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey."

(00:57:11):
So the benchmarks when you are at level three are now you're probably 30 to 100 people inside your company. You're probably at Series B-ish territory in terms of venture, maybe late Series A, maybe early Series C, but probably around Series B. You've really cracked a demand channel. You've cracked marketing and sales. You've got at least one channel that is very scalable. And probably 10% or more of your inbound is coming from just referrals and word of mouth and you're getting known, like we talked about.

(00:57:45):
ACV ranges are very high. Very wide, I should say. I'd say where you want to get to with level three is 100 customers. And so if you're approaching 100 customers and maybe you have 75K average ACV, that would be strong. You're in this wide zone of five million, all the way up to 25 million ARR. That is very level three. And you're actually starting now to think about some of these efficiency metrics. Remember, we've been punting efficiency. We were saying it shouldn't be worse than a certain number, but it's not a focus. Now, it's got to come into focus.

(00:58:20):
Because the way that we get to level four is we keep ripping on the satisfaction and the demand, and we tune this thing to get very efficient. So we're talking about our gross margin needs to be above 60%, hopefully above 70%. Our burn multiple is now below three. Ideally, we're close to one. Burn multiple in the one to three zone is where we want to be at level three. Regretted churn's less than 10%, NRR is greater than 110%. These are good benchmarks for this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
Hearing level three again tells me level two is basically your pivot from: I'm just grinding customers, selling, pitching, constantly trying to find new people, to level three, where it's coming at you and basically, it's the way you always hear about it, as you described. It's rolling downhill. Fish are jumping in the boat. I haven't heard that one before, but I love this.

(00:59:11):
So essentially, you found a demand channel. You found a way to get people to come to you. A lot of them are just hearing about you from other people, you don't even know where they're coming from. 10% you said are coming from referrals and you're getting to 100 customers. I actually have another quote from David Hsu at Retool, and he actually said even at 100 customers, he still felt like every customer he was getting was the last one.

Todd Jackson (00:59:33):
Oh, wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
He's like, "I can't believe we got DoorDash. That's incredible. Okay. I think there's no more. That's it."

Todd Jackson (00:59:39):
He is a critical person and critical of himself, but a very high expectations person, let's say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:43):
Yeah. Actually, another quote from Ali Ghodsi from Databricks actually said even at 100 million, he wasn't sure they had product-market fit.

Todd Jackson (00:59:50):
I mean, come on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Because he's like, "I don't know." I don't know. He felt like, "This is it. Okay, we're done. We're going to cap out here." And I get that.

Todd Jackson (00:59:58):
I think if you told many, many pre-seed founders that they'd be able to get to 100 million and not know whether they had product-market fit, they'd probably take that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):
But I think that's maybe an interesting insight. It's often good to be really paranoid and not feel like, "Okay, we're on our way. Let's start pouring in money. Let's do it."

Todd Jackson (01:00:13):
I think that's what makes a lot of the best founders the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Indeed. Okay, so level three, anything else that would be useful here? Maybe what are signs that you're struggling at level three, you're stuck?

Todd Jackson (01:00:25):
Yeah. So level three problems. And again, it's hard to get to level three, so awesome work for getting here. But the problems that might start to emerge are you've got a leaky bucket, your NRR is below 90%, or your regretted churn's greater than 10%. Maybe growth is just slowing down. You grew three X each of the prior two years, but you're struggling to do a two X this year. At level three, or five years into the company or so, there's probably a lot of competition. If you've gotten here, you've got something that's working, and people are starting to notice and there's going to be competitors.

(01:01:01):
And they could be the big competitors, they could be the new startups, but you're going to have to figure out how to navigate probably a tougher market than you entered five years ago. And so maybe you found your first scalable channel, but it's getting saturated, you got to find a new channel. These are the level three problems. Or you're growing, but like I said, with efficiency, you're spending too much money to grow. So you feel like, "Okay, yeah, we can grow at three X year over year, two X year over year, but that's going to push our burn multiple above three again." And that's a little bit of a pickle to be in when you have to trade off growth and spend like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):
You make it sound like life's great, level three people are coming at us. I think it's important to note never is it easy, never is it like, "Okay, we're good. Let's just ride this wave. Life's going to get so much easier from now on." It's never easy. As you said, there's all these things, you're always still juggling, you still aren't sure it's going to keep going.

Todd Jackson (01:01:55):
No, I agree. It's like you're spinning plates, and the higher levels you get, there's more plates. You have to keep spinning. And so at level three and getting to level four, we've got to maintain satisfaction and demand. We cannot let them regress in a market that's getting harder, and we have to really start focusing on efficiency. And the companies that can maintain satisfaction and demand and continue to grow and become really efficient, now we're at level four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Let's talk about level four. What does that look like? What are some problems people run into there?

Todd Jackson (01:02:26):
So first of all, congrats. If you get to level four, you have a valuable company. You are probably already a unicorn, and you're starting to think about, "Can I become a decacorn?" And so you've reached the highest levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency. And so the benchmarks at level four are like, "Okay, now your team is probably bigger than 100 people, you're Series C, Series D or beyond. You've got more than 100 customers and you're starting to figure out, 'How do I get to 200, 300, eventually 1,000 customers?'" You're beyond 25 million in ARR, so 25 million and up, I think in ARR, it qualifies as level four. And your other metrics are looking really good too. Your sales conversion first call to close one is probably better than 15%, your magic number is greater than one, your tax payback is less than 12 months.

(01:03:13):
All these things are super awesome. And finally, now you've got your gross margin above 80%. Your burn multiple's ideally less than one at this point, you've got less than 10% churn. You've got greater than 120% NRR. And so now the whole thing is like, "Well, how do I keep growing?" This thing's gotten pretty big. And this is generally when we get to 100 million, especially and beyond, the stage that founders are thinking about, "How do I keep growing by expanding TAM, by expanding total addressable market?" And to expand TAM, I can usually take my product and bring it into new markets, or I start to think about multiple products as a way to expand TAM.

(01:03:55):
And so this is where you see all the truly great companies, the legendary companies are all able to do that. Vanta has begun to do this. They have the Vanta trust management platform, they've got security questionnaires, they've got vendor risk management. So they're starting to do this. You think of Verkada, who I mentioned before. They started with cloud security cameras, now they do alarms, now they do smoke detectors, now they do badge readers. Stripe has classic Stripe, but they've got Stripe Radar, Stripe Atlas. Square has the Square Stand, Cash App, Square Checking, Square Loans. All the companies that are tens of billions of dollars of value have figured out a way to do this. And it's like the never-ending journey that you said before, Lenny. Like, "Congrats, you got to level four."

(01:04:40):
But there's just this endless thirst for continued growth. And the interesting thing about that is that it requires finding product-market fit over and over again. Just because you got to level four on your main product doesn't mean product-market fit is free on all these new products. And you've been inside Airbnb and I've been inside Dropbox and Twitter. Getting new products to be successful is hard and it requires this mindset of like, "Yeah, we've got a little bit of advantage because people know who we are, and we have a customer set that hopefully we can layer on new products to. But it's not easy." You have to get into this mindset of product-market fit is never easy, and if we want to continue to grow, we got to find it again and again and maintain that mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
Casey Winters has this great point also that expectations of customers ever increase. And so you have product-market fit today, but there's going to be better products coming out, they're changing, the world changes. And so not only do you have to worry about competitors, there's just expectations continue to rise. So it's a never-ending battle. To give people a little bit of a broader sense here, what percentage of companies do you find make it through each of these stages in your experience, what are rough numbers you may have in your head?

Todd Jackson (01:05:52):
The majority of companies, so greater than 50%, probably closer to 60 or 70%, are going to get stuck at L1 or L2. And so that leaves, roughly, let's say, 30% make it to L3 or L4 just in our experience looking broadly. And that's our entire goal. Because again, once you get to L3, you've got a real shot, you've got a real shot at building an awesome company. And so if we get that number, help founders get that number above 30%, imagine if that was 50/50 and half the companies that we were working with at seed were able to get to level three strong product-market fit. I think that would be epic. And I think our founders would... There'd be incredible benefits to the ecosystem from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Okay. So essentially, 60% ish of companies don't make it past L2. And I love the way you're framing it of just, "If we can just get a few more companies further, that makes a massive dent both in the world and the lives of founders and people that want to use products." Another question I wanted to talk about briefly is just again, the timelines of each of these levels. Just in your rough experience, how long do each of these levels roughly take so people can get a sense of like, "Oh, it's taken a lot longer. Maybe there's a problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:07:10):
So again, this whole thing probably takes four to six years, and so let's just pick five years as the number to get to level four. I think the way this works, ideally, is you probably take 12 to 18 months to do level one, because that is the most important level, honestly, in my mind because that's where you're really choosing the right persona and the right problem to focus on. And I think just that choice is one of the most important choices that founders make. And the interesting thing, my partner, Josh Kopelman, talks about this all the time, is that founders spend 99% of their time building because that's what they've done.

(01:07:53):
And they spend 1% of their time picking, in picking the market, picking the problem, picking the customer. And in reality, it's that pick that determines the constraints and the boundaries of where you're going to be working for the next, hopefully, 10 years of your life. So there's a real imbalance there. And I actually think that that pick is the most important thing. So I would actually like to spend, let's say, somewhere 12 to 18 months in level one, just really figuring that out and figuring out my four Ps. And then, hopefully, I move very quickly. It takes me a while to get to my first five satisfied customers, but they love it.

(01:08:28):
And then I go quickly through L2, maybe that takes about a year. This is like the Looker path, the happy path. And then L3 is long just because we're going all the way from five million in revenue up to 25, and that might take a year or two, probably two years even in a good case. And then getting from 25 to 100 million is hard, obviously very hard. And then that probably takes a couple years. And then you're figuring out all of these things.

(01:08:53):
You're growing your team and your company's got a lot more moving parts and functions, and there's a demand generation side of the house and sales and there's engineering and the whole thing just gets more complicated with a lot more people. But I think that if you set the foundation really nicely at level one and level two that hopefully the whole thing... The boulder is rolling down the hill and it's carrying you forward and you don't just feel like you're pushing this rock uphill for five years. That's not a fun place to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:22):
There's a lot of founders in that place and I know a few, so this is really interesting. So you're roughly saying that maybe spend a year, year and a half on level one, which is you're just grinding, cold emailing, reaching out, selling customers, and maybe getting to five customers in the first year and a half. That's at the extreme, but that's a good outcome. And then maybe another year trying to get to... What was it? 20? 25 customers.

Todd Jackson (01:09:45):
Going from five to 25 quickly. Yeah, if I see a company go from five customers to 25 in a year, that is almost always a sign that there's some pretty strong product-market fit there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:56):
Awesome. So many companies don't go through that, and they have the funding to keep iterating, exploring, trying to figure things out. I don't know if you have the answer here, but just what's your advice of if it's been four years and demand is not starting to come to them, they don't have 25 customers? Is it, "Wait until you run out of money, just give it a shot"? Or is it, "Let's just give the money back and move on to something else"?

Todd Jackson (01:10:21):
Well, that's a personal decision for founders. I do think if you've been going at it for four to five years and you haven't started to find anything that you're really feeling pull from the market on, I don't know, you've done it for four to five years, what are the chances that you're going to magically find something? I think there are probably a handful of startups that do it that figure it out and get back on an amazing growth curve, but that's the exception rather than the rule.

(01:10:46):
So if a founder wants to return the money to investors, if a founder wants to look for a soft landing, there's no shame in that. Product-market fit is very, very hard. That's why we're doing this. It's why we're trying to increase the odds. And we're also trying to make it clear what it looks like and what it doesn't look like. And everybody knows when they do a startup that the odds are that you will not get there. So there's no shame in that, and I would completely be supportive of any founder who wants to take that path.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):
I love that advice. I think that was a really important point to make. Let's quickly summarize the levels and then I want to also summarize the four Ps again, because I think that's the thing you can actually do. And so I think I just want to reinforce, "Here's the four things you should play with if things aren't going in the direction." So first of all, let's summarize the levels, what it looks like and what you should be focusing on there.

Todd Jackson (01:11:38):
Okay. So level one, nascent product-market fit. You're just trying to get three to five customers and you're focused on satisfaction first and foremost. Level two is developing. This is where you're going from five to 25 customers, and you're really starting to focus on demand. Level three is strong product-market fit. You're going from 25 customers up to 100 or more, and you've got to start thinking about efficiency at that scale. And then level four is extreme, you're more than 100 customers, your company's awesome. You got to keep doing all three of those things well, and you have to start looking for ways to expand your total addressable market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):
Okay, perfect. And then let's come back to the four Ps. I have the draft. I have your post up here, so I have the detailed version of each of these things. But could you just talk through these four things? What is it you should be thinking about changing if things aren't working, the four Ps basically?

Todd Jackson (01:12:30):
Yeah. So the four Ps again are: persona, problem, promise, and product. And the persona is interesting because in some ways, it's synonymous with the market. A lot of people think of the market in this macroeconomic way where it's like, "Oh, it's this category of ERP software or whatever." I think it's much more tangible for a founder to think of the market as a collection of people. Jack Altman was thinking about his market as all of the HR leaders out there, and he was thinking about how many of them are there and what are the problems they have and how much money are they willing to spend on solving those problems.

(01:13:12):
It's a collection of people who have money to pay for a product or pay for a service. And so that's really the first piece, find the persona and really try to get into the mind of the persona. That's another thing I was amazed about spending time with Zach from Plaid, and Lloyd from Looker, and Jack from Lattice. They had all of these people, they were text messaging with all of their customers and they're meeting them on the weekends and stuff. They really, really knew their customer well. They were friends with their customers.

(01:13:45):
And so you've got to get so deep into the mind of the persona and: what are their challenges? What are their goals? How do you help them succeed at their job? That's the stuff that earns you the right to get the rest of the Ps right. And so the problem, obviously, comes next. And I think about this, and I can actually get into, Lenny, a little bit if you want to get into some of the customer discovery stuff because that's the second session.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
Perfect segue.

Todd Jackson (01:14:14):
And I was talking a little bit about we think of it as dollar-driven customer discovery. And I think a lot of founders are familiar with customer discovery. I think they at least talk to customers, which is good. I don't think most of them do it in the highest signal way because again, the customers, they're people, they're nice, they're going to be polite. They're also not good at predicting things that they will use or buy or want.

(01:14:41):
They're very good at talking about their problems, but they're not necessarily good at predicting their own behavior. So we think about it in terms of dollar-driven discovery, which is how do you test the dollar potential of a hypothesis? And this is a whole two-hour session, but I'll try to do it briefly here just to give you a sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):
No, let's get into it. Let's keep going. I'm just joking.

Todd Jackson (01:15:02):
So you've got to identify extreme value. This is independent of what I'm building, Lenny. I want to hear about your problems and your challenges and what is most important to you. And so I need to do it in this non-leading way and I need to avoid the trap that we call happy years. Because I found a lot of founders, "I want to build this thing, I want you to like my thing." And so I look for the things that you say that support what I'm doing. That's the trap. And so I could just try it on you, Lenny. Yeah, I might say...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):
Let's do it.

Todd Jackson (01:15:36):
Okay, Lenny, so you're doing Lenny's Newsletter and you're building Lenny's Podcasts. When you think about we're sitting here in April, over the next three months, let's say, what are your top three goals for Lenny's Newsletter and Lenny's Podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:53):
Oh, wow, interesting. I'm trying to find a more scalable way to do this newsletter long-term. It's basically something I have to do for the rest of my life, in theory. I don't know if there's an exit path for this newsletter career, so I'm trying to find ways to scale this over time. That's one. Two is just up-leveling the quality of each podcast episode in terms of visuals and audio and trailers and things like that. And then three is make the community more valuable to everyone that listens that's in the newsletter community. Those are top of mind.

Todd Jackson (01:16:26):
Okay, awesome. And so what's hard about those three things? You said you want to scale the newsletter, you want to increase quality, you want to make the community awesome. What's hard about those things? Or what's standing in your way of doing those?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:39):
I don't have the answer yet, I guess is the answer. I don't know exactly how to do this yet.

Todd Jackson (01:16:44):
You don't know how to do it. Okay. It's probably a service in this case, not a product. What if I was able to give you a service that said, "Lenny, you're going to be able to scale this podcast. We are going to help you find the 500 best guests in the world that are really excellent. We're going to guarantee they show up. You're going to have endless content on your podcast, in your newsletter"? What do you think about that? What do you think about that idea?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:16):
I'd pay a lot of money for that.

Todd Jackson (01:17:18):
Okay. So that's an example of a wow statement. And you probably had in the back of your mind, "How are you going to do that? Is that actually going to work?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
That's right.

Todd Jackson (01:17:28):
In my experience, that's a good thing and an exciting thing. If I'm pitching a product idea to somebody and they are like, "Wow, does that really work? And if that thing works, I'd sign up for the wait list today." That to me is like, "Okay, now I got to figure out how to build that thing, but I know if I am able to build it and deliver on that promise, they are going to want it." Or you would maybe say signs like you would demonstrate a behavior that shows that you're interested in. You'd be like, "Oh, Todd, can we meet again next week to talk about this?" Or like, "Hey Todd, I actually would love to show this to the people I work with. Can you send me the deck?"

(01:18:06):
Those are the signs that I'm looking for. If you had reacted like, "Yeah, that sounds kind of interesting," that's a no, right? That is a no. The word interesting is a polite way of saying no, right? And so I'm either looking for wow statements or I'm looking for demonstrated behavior that shows interest. I then would probably, if I want to keep going with this, and this is all in the identifying extreme value, I'd ask you, "Well, what stands out as valuable here to you?" And I want to hear you answer quickly. You mentioned it's either going to make my products so much better, it's going to drive success for my business, or it's going to save me a bunch of money or something. Save me a bunch of risk." But something where you would very quickly be able to identify why that's valuable to you.

(01:18:51):
So that part one is extreme value. Then I got to figure out ability to pay and willingness to pay. And for you, this is easy because you're not a 5,000 person company and you're the boss. So this is probably pretty streamlined. There's no procurement function at Lenny's Newsletter. So let's say I'm going after a bigger company. The questions I'd ask on confirming the ability to pay are: are you currently looking for a product like this? Or are you building something internally?

(01:19:24):
This is the Ironclad thing where Jason was like, "Oh, you're looking for a CLM already." Another way I think about it is if a customer has a problem, and I really think they have a problem, and they know they have the problem and they're looking for a solution for the problem. Or they've even tried to build their own solution to it and failed, that's the best customer. They want this thing badly. They've demonstrated that and they've actually failed at building it because they underestimated how hard it was. So are you currently looking for building a solution here?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):
Essentially, there's a budget. You're looking for, "Is there money to go towards this problem"?

Todd Jackson (01:20:01):
That's the next question I was going to say is where would a budget for this come from? And the best answer is that there's an existing budget. Either we already spend money in some way for a competing tool, or something that can be displaced by you, or we're spending, we put five engineers together to help build this thing. There's some source of budget that I can get. Then the question is, "Well, how does your team make decisions on third-party tools to bring on?" And you're never going to get the cleanest answer here. In larger companies, you might get semi-clean answers, but it's something like, "Okay, this manager can approve it directly up to a certain dollar amount. If not, it goes to this next level up of manager. And if we're going to spend more than 50K on it, we actually have to compare three different alternatives."

(01:20:47):
But whatever, there's some known process. That's what I'm looking for rather than just a bunch of ambiguity. So that's ability to pay. And then I'm going into willingness to pay. I don't want to try to quantify that. That's where I go, "What's your budget for solving this? What are you paying for this other tool? Let me show you mine. You think that you'd pay less for that or you'd pay more for that? Can you replace this other thing with the thing I have?" And then I love this question. I think you've had Madhavan Ramanujam on the show, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):
Mm-hmm.

Todd Jackson (01:21:17):
He has this question, he's from Simon-Kucher. I love his thing of like, "Lenny, what is a fair price you would pay for this thing that I just described to you?" And then you say your thing. And then I go, "Okay. Well, what would be an expensive price?" And then I say, "Okay, what would be a prohibitively expensive price?" And you ask those three questions. And generally, when people tell you the fair price, it's a little bit of like they're trying to get a deal. And if the product's good, the expensive price is the one that they would actually pay.

(01:21:47):
Where they're saying it feels expensive, but you put it in front of them, and you say, "It costs this much," and if it's really good, they want it. And the prohibitively expensive one is the one that's too expensive and they'd have to just, "I just can't do that." So I love these style of questions. I think they're just a lot more specific than what I see most founders doing, which is just chatting with customers. You really want to try to put them to some questions where you know they're going to answer honestly because you're asking them questions. You're not asking them to speculate and you're asking them fairly concrete stuff.

(01:22:18):
Oh, and the thing I should say is it's a two-hour session, like I mentioned. It's one thing to explain this stuff, but it's another thing to see it. And so we show tons of Zoom recordings from founders who have gone through the program, and we actually do this thing where all the founders who are going through the program, they recorded all their videos, their customer discovery videos, and then our team watches all of the videos and creates highlight reels.

(01:22:45):
And we sit around in a room and watch them together and we say like, "Oh, look at these questions that Lenny asked. And did you see how the customer responded? Wow, that's an eyes-light-up moment." Or, "Todd asked these questions, he's leading the witness a little bit and the customer didn't seem that interested." So the thing that's interesting is as a founder, you never see anybody else's version of this. You only have your own experience. And so just seeing how other founders do this in a real live setting is super. People love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):
And it's always easy to hear these things. It's much harder to be the person asking these questions to a potential customer you're trying to sell. And it's just asking, "How much would you pay for this?" So I love that you kind of force people through the actual practice of it. Todd, you're going to get a lot of applicants for this program. This sounds amazing. I know you're giving a peek at the stuff that we haven't really talked about. On this point you just shared, which is essentially trying to get real skin in the game insight into how big of a problem this is, I love that you just basically shared a bunch of questions.

(01:23:43):
Someone could just rewind right now and just write down all these questions that you shared and use them when you're talking to customers. Obviously, the classic problem is they tell you they're going to buy it but they don't. And all the stuff you shared is, "Here's ways to get at: will they actually buy it before they have the actual product?" Is there anything else you want to say on that? Just tips for not being tricked and people just saying, "Oh, yeah, I love this thing"? I know you talked through a lot of this, but anything else?

Todd Jackson (01:24:06):
Yeah, I think there's a couple of things. One is you have to know what to show people when you're actually showing them something. Lattice is the kind of product I mentioned that could be sold with Figma mock-ups. Looker couldn't be sold that way. Looker, you actually had to do a demo with their real data. So it required a lot more work to do that. Vanta was neither like a demo or a mock-up, it was actually doing the work. And Pilot was like that. There's a bunch of companies like that. So you have to figure out what is my product and how does it solve the problem? And therefore, what fidelity does my early product or early demo have to be at in order to land the sale?

(01:24:44):
And then I think you have to know when you've talked to enough people. It takes time to talk to people. And the rule of thumb is if you talk to enough people and you can predict 70 to 80% of what the next person is going to say to you, because you've just talked to so many people and you've heard the pattern so clearly, that's when you've talked to enough people. But these are all things you got to learn. And that's why doing it experientially in the way that we do the program we think was best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Is there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to touch on before we let you go?

Todd Jackson (01:25:15):
No. If you're listening, if you're a B2B founder in those early days of starting your company, or you know anyone who fits that description, and you have an appreciation for just how hard it is to find product-market fit and you don't want to go it alone, then please apply to this program or share the application. Like we promise, we will review every single application. And I'm just really looking forward to working with a group of 20 or so amazing founders, and helping them navigate these early days of product-market fit finding. It's what I love to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:43):
So just to make sure the right people apply, remind people who is a great fit. So it's B2B founders, and you said they've been at it for six to nine months, something like that?

Todd Jackson (01:25:52):
Yeah, something in that zone or earlier. You have an idea of what your product is. You have a hypothesis about what it is and who it's for, but you probably haven't started writing any code yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:01):
And if they've been at it for four years and haven't found success, this is not a fit.

Todd Jackson (01:26:07):
I could try to help them one-on-one, but no, that's not a fit for this program.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:10):
And then how do they apply and when are their applications due?

Todd Jackson (01:26:13):
Yeah. So you go to pmf.firstround.com. Applications are open. They're going to go till May 7th, and then the program starts on May 29th. And if you want to reach out to me specifically, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @tjack, T-J-A-C-K. You can follow me, DM me. And yeah, I'm looking forward to working with some amazing founders that I know are listening right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:34):
Amazing. I'm so happy we did this. I feel like this conversation is going to help a ton of founders, and they're going to come back to it again and again. Todd, thank you so much for being here.

Todd Jackson (01:26:43):
Lenny, it's been a pleasure.

# Why AI is disrupting traditional product management | Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I think it's so underappreciated, the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I check it at least 10 times a day. What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:06):
I start backwards. It's like what is the potential here? If you start from the premise that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Is there anything tactically that would just like, wow, that really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post, share interesting content?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:25):
To really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products. This is not a traffic jumpstart, it's not an upsell feed. It's really about people that matter, talking about things that I care about professionally. The first thing we did was really making AI first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:43):
So it wasn't like, "Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?" It was like, "Let go of what you've built. Go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
There's so much I want to dig into here. Is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:57):
AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's really about...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today my guest is Tomer Cohen. Tomer is chief product officer at LinkedIn overseeing all teams responsible for building and creating LinkedIn products and experiences, including product development, design, business development, content creation, and customer operations. During his tenure at LinkedIn, Tomer was head of the mobile team, led the effort to revamp the LinkedIn feed and to many people surprised, made it extremely interesting in a place I check regularly. And he was also at the center of shifting LinkedIn to an AI first mindset, which started way before AI became cool. In our conversation, Tomer goes inside the strategy behind the transformation of LinkedIn's feed and how they approached making it a place that people wanted to check and make it much more social.

(00:01:49):
We also get into the one mindset that Tomer credits for helping him rise so quickly within LinkedIn. Also, why Tomer's most repeated mantra is, "We might be wrong, but we are not confused." And so much more. This episode is for anyone wanting to see what great product leadership looks like and wants to be inspired to think bigger. A big thank you to Shira Gasarch, Dan Roth, Josh Redfern, and Sparsh Argawal for question suggestions that made this episode so interesting. With that, I bring you Tomer Cohen.

(00:02:24):
Tomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:27):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):
Absolutely, my pleasure. So as I was preparing for this podcast, I reached out to a bunch of people that have worked with you and asked them what I should ask you on this podcast, and interestingly, every single one of them said this one thing that I need to ask you, which is about this phrase that apparently you use all the time. So first of all, can you guess what this phrase might be?

Tomer Cohen (00:02:47):
I have a few. Sometimes people call them Tomerisms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
Tomerisms.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:50):
But probably I might be wrong but not confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:54):
That's the one. Amazing. Okay, so let's talk about this phrase.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:58):
I don't say it so much anymore. I think it's ingrained into the cultures.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):
I was going to say that.

Tomer Cohen (00:03:03):
When they think of me, they think of this sentence already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:04):
Those are the ultimate things where you don't need to say them as much anymore. Okay, so the phrase again is, "We might be wrong but we're not confused."

Tomer Cohen (00:03:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:11):
Let's talk about this. So what does this phrase mean and why do you find it so powerful and important to say often?

Tomer Cohen (00:03:17):
Yeah, by the way, it's a simple phrase, but it has in my opinion, so much depth into that and ultimately something I really believe in. It's rooted in clarity and principles that ultimately lead to leadership. And the first time I got the inspiration from it was from a startup founder I met many, many years ago. Their company was on the brink of failure. They had their last attempt and they decided on a path forward and after they decided on a path forward, he was still seeing people hedging in different directions and it led into this confusion in the system where we decided people are still hedging, they're still trying out things they thought could work, and he realized that unless they basically all pull through in the same direction, there is no chance they'll be able to be successful.

(00:04:04):
Now, pulling through in the same direction doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but this gives you a chance of success and that confusion, the system only luck and save you. So that was when he shared that, that was very impactful for me. I think it's a good one for life as well. And for me it comes down to two main parts. One is clarity of thought and clarity of execution, and they're both equally important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:29):

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercell, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS, it's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at WorkOS.com to learn more, that's WorkOS.com.

Tomer Cohen (00:06:46):
On the clarity of thought. What I find people to be attached to, especially when you build an environment with a lot of alpha types is that they get attached to being right or wrong and that really creates a lot of lingering in the system, a lot of confusion and they're still stuck to their ideas. And for me, I get attached to clarity and focus. I think that's much more important. That's why I think when I say I don't mind being wrong, it really comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than necessarily try to hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success. The way we start, we do this in our product gens right now, is we actually spend some significant time on what is the problem we're trying to solve for, but not high level, not like, hey, we want to launch this product, we want to launch a video product.

(00:07:35):
It's exactly what type of video you're trying to launch for which audience, what is your unique criteria, what are you trying, what is very nuanced about what you're trying to solve for? Ideally, once the time you see the problem, you know exactly the problem you're trying, you actually can imagine that mountain. It's not just a mountain, you can see exactly the road, you can see exactly the end of the base camp. But then when you move to solution, I love solutions that are based on first principles. That they have, there's a principle thinking about it, there's opinions about it. If you talk to folks who work with me, they'll tell you, I push a lot for what is actually your opinion, what is your potentially controversial opinion and the best principles have teeth.

(00:08:18):
So saying that we should build a simple product for me is useless. Who doesn't want to build a simple product? But saying that I'm willing to sacrifice or trade off this, that's where I get excited. I'm like, okay, that's a very strong opinion. Let's go into that. Why were you willing to trade off those type of vectors to make it happen? And one thing that I saw also in clarity of thought was this, is I came to the US in 2008, I came from Israel. Our hobby in Israel is to argue. So we argue a lot, it's our love language in many ways. And I come to the US and I notice people say a lot like I don't exactly understand or I'm not exactly clear on this, and it took me a long time to realize they're actually disagreeing.

(00:09:03):
They're just masking it with a layer of misunderstanding and a good mentor of mine said, "Hey, just push back. Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding? If you're misunderstanding, let's spend the night. Let's get to a point where you can articulate my point of view in your words and I can do the same, but if we're disagreeing, let's stop. Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, "Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative." And then I'll say, "But most of your engineers are working on this migration." And they'll say, "Yeah, we have to finish that." I'm like, "So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?" It's like, "Yeah."

(00:10:09):
It's like, but that's exactly what you're doing. You have to make sure that what you're sharing as a priority is actually manifested in your resourcing. Then I'm like, "Hey, this is your top talent. Why is your top talent working on some moonshots that are not in your number one priority?" And they're like, "Yeah." This is where you start finding that really it doesn't really translate into execution as well and you can solve so much by just making that sure that focus is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:36):
So the big lesson here is to push for clarity and push out anything that is unclear, confusion either in thought and also in execution. One of the folks that I talked to that worked with you about this phrase, Josh Redfern, he said that this phrase became really liberating for him, which is really interesting to hear because it forces you to make a call and to be aligned and make sure everyone is on the same page. I guess thoughts on just why this concept is so liberating.

Tomer Cohen (00:11:04):
It goes back to little alpha types or type A folks who are just so attached to not getting it wrong. When you need to move forward and it's not about being right or wrong, it's really about not being confused and making sure everybody's pulling in the same direction. That is actually really liberating. And when you know that the whole idea is to have a Socratic conversation about what you're trying to do, then coming to the table with some kind of half-baked ideas or actually not an opinion, I think actually brings into a conversation of feedback.

(00:11:39):
But you have to manifest it through, if you just play this through but then you potentially playing the right or wrong game, that's really poor. I also think it's the best way to learn. If you don't know exactly what you're doing, how can you learn back from why you made that decision? So if you had a clear understanding, ultimately it's a growing organization. This is not a one-off project. We're going to build many projects in the future. So if you're not sure about what we're trying to accomplish, how can you know what you learned from it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
I love that. So the idea here is make it very okay to be wrong, but make it not okay to be confused and not clear about here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it. Everyone's aligned exactly on the same idea.

Tomer Cohen (00:12:19):
How can I have a product conversation if I'm not sure what you stand for? It's really hard to have a Socratic conversation, really hard to have. If you ask folks how many time you left a meeting in corporate, it could be a startup or larger companies and you are not sure exactly what was the problem discussed or what are next steps. More often than not, they'll raise their hand. That for me is a waste of building time. So actually that agitates me in another great way, but when I come in and I'm proven wrong or there's a strong challenge or argument, again that's a little bit my love language, I actually enjoy those. I think we leave the conversation much better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):
You said there's some other Tomerisms, what are some others just that you can share?

Tomer Cohen (00:13:14):
This is, again, this is classic to building large organizations, but I actually believe in, especially when it comes to products, to really set ambitious goals but then try to over-deliver on them, really set what are you trying to, there's almost like the opposite where people are underplaying it and over delivering, I don't understand what you're trying to do. For me it's like we are here to make an impact. We're here to really set our goals to something really massive. And when I'm trying to visualize this, I see a mountain, you see the peak and the peak exactly how it looks like, you see base camp, you know how to start and maybe the middle of the mountain is kind of blurry, but you'll figure this out. But at least you know the peak you're trying to share, share the peak, share where you're headed to and I think it's just a much more exciting way to build product. It's a much more inspirational way for folks to be part of the product process kind of thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):
I was just chatting with Vlad who worked at Airbnb for many years. He was actually my former manager at Airbnb and he reported to Brian for a long time and we talked about this trait that Brian also is really good at, is just setting crazy high goals. 10 X the goal that you thought you had and what would it take and it worked really well for Airbnb. So I love that you're doubling down on the same idea. Is there an example that comes to mind of one that you, some ambitious goal you set internally at LinkedIn that people are like, "No way," and then it ended up being effective?

Tomer Cohen (00:14:35):
Actually there's a lot, when I think about our LinkedIn feed and thinking about when you started off, it was hard to imagine what that product could be because it was more of a promotional in nature product and I was like, no, is going to be a place where millions of people and not just tens of millions will come daily. And that's insane. That makes no sense based on the numbers today, but I don't start building from the numbers today. I start from [inaudible 00:15:04] I start backwards. I'm like, what this could be, what is the potential here? So how many professionals exist in their role? How many of them would love to find a place to share and engage with content? And this is my starting point. I start from there. So I don't start from the existence to set my ambition. I start from what this could be like based on really inspiration and excitement.

(00:15:30):
Again, it's not detached from reality completely, but it's also not hooked to it. But then Basecamp could be a good start. You're not asking you to make it the next day, but if you don't have that ambition, there's no way you're going to hit that. There's just no way. And there's so many products across LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a 20 plus year old company that many folks did not give it a chance in almost every phase of it. And I think if anything, it's one of those that just keeps getting better and better every year. And part of it is you keep the landmark on. This really has the potential to do so much for so many people. It's really an economic platform. So if you play from that, one billion members, that's actually pretty small where we can actually go,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:17):
I'm so happy you went to this example. This is exactly where I wanted to take the conversation. I was very much in the camp you described of LinkedIn, how could LinkedIn possibly become a place that I want to go and browse a feed and post content? As you probably know, for the longest time it was felt like this cringey place as you said, where everyone comes and promotes themselves, "Hey, I got a promotion or here's my company's new launch." And I think it's so underappreciated the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I use it, I'm a multi-day, multi-Dow user. I check it at least 10 times a day. Most of my traffic to my newsletter comes from LinkedIn, not Twitter where people think, it's absurdly underappreciated and it's I think underappreciated what it took to make this happen.

(00:17:02):
And when I saw you guys starting to try to make it a place people post content, I was like, no way, this is not going to work. Why would people want to share stuff on LinkedIn? And it's working, it's amazing. So I want to spend some time here and just try to go inside the strategy that you guys put together to here's how we're going to make this happen. Come, we've shared, you have this peak of here's what we could become. How did you actually turn this around? What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:17:26):
Yeah, by the way, I'm glad you're finding great audience and traffic on LinkedIn. I think your content, actually, your content is exactly what we're trying to build for, it's expertise, it's advice, it's people you can learn from and it's also the views that really matter, not just the volume that matters. I think if we take a step back, there's so much conversation about zero to one products or scaling products, but you don't have much conversations about minus one to one products, like turnaround products. And I think there's obviously the perception of the market you have to deal with, but people I think in minus to one products, at least from my experience and we had a few at LinkedIn, pages is another one, helping businesses build their presence on LinkedIn. What you find is it's actually, most of the time it's internally harder to do because there's so much entrenched flows and processes and metrics that people are using on that specific area.

(00:18:21):
So you almost have to change the inner workings of the system to make it work. Going back to the analogy of the mountain, if you start from the premise that I deeply believe in is that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Then really almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible and knowledge transaction is one of the most powerful economic transactions you can have. It's the biggest accelerant for an experience and we were always very strong at helping people get a job. We have seven hires per minute, but as we were building more and more knowledge and part of it was we bought LinkedIn, we bought Lynda to make it LinkedIn Learning a while back. Today we had 140 hours of learning every minute on LinkedIn happening across the feed and LinkedIn Learning, it's pretty powerful.

(00:19:13):
And the transformation to the LinkedIn feed was exactly like you said. We actually were the first company to have a social feed, but I think we started wrong. So we started with basically activity feed. So it was like who changed what, who changed the job, who connected to who. It was more of like a tracking your network feed and it became more promotional in nature. So in a way just letting that be just naturally just moved into more of a promotional type of feed. And what we've done is we've shifted dramatically into building, actually this was one of the things I was excited about. So after I was leading the mobile team, there was no feed team, there was no unified feed team, there was no feed PM to an extent, I asked to do this role, nobody cared about it. I really believed in it.

(00:20:07):
I have strong conviction about what I could do there. And I asked to do this role and we assembled the team around it and one of the main things we've done was to really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange. It's about how can I get the right views to the right experts in a way that actually helps them build a reputation and build their business. And then we started from there backwards. So it was basically setting that ground for that mountain peak that was nowhere to be imagined at the beginning and making our way backwards.

(00:20:55):
The first thing we did was really making AI first. So the AI team back then was completely centralized. It was not part of any product team and we brought it together with one unified AI first team. And the belief I had was ultimately the engine of the car was AI and that was almost like de-prioritized or delegated to a team that was not unified in objectives. So bring that in. And then I spent most of my time on objectives and algorithm features and data training, which led me into my passion about training product people to be a first product people. And that was a big transformation there, really shifting and we had incredible AI team, but they were completely, actually, it was a confused operation. They were building something for a whole different purpose and we were trying to aim to that mountain peak and they were putting in a different direction. No bad intent, that's what they were told to do.

(00:21:56):
So bringing it together into this SWAT team was the first thing that actually was extremely powerful, but then became the hard work. You have a product that works in a certain way and you almost want to change its DNA altogether. And it was very hard because whenever we were trying to run experiments that were mass in scale, I told you everybody was relying on the feed for their traffic. It just scared the whole system because numbers were shifting up and down and teams were freaking out about meeting their goals. And then I realized that was just spending my time in escalations instead of actually building a great product. So what I did was I carved out two million members and I said, "Those are my members. I'm going to focus on building that mountain peak. I'm going to build for them."

(00:22:45):
Full liberty and doing whatever, it doesn't hurt numbers, giving the scale and really focus on building a great experience for them. And it wasn't overnight and it wasn't over a week, but over the course of months we've seen dramatic behavior change for those members, almost like secluded, like a country of people that were seeing a different experience of LinkedIn. And once we saw that you actually had strong evidence that wow, if I bring this in, we don't need to spend time talking about how this pie gets slotted between different teams. We can actually grow the pie. The experience just manifests itself in a whole different way and that was a big change internally. It wasn't overnight, but it was really powerful in getting everybody around to see, wow, we have this cohort that is doing extremely well, which was a randomized cohort and then how we can bring it out.

(00:23:39):
I've also done some crazy things. We've done some negative tests to prove some stuff out, test for the sake of learning. When you run something that you can show that if it's just a promotional feed and you played it out organically over time, engage with the tier rates. We ran some really important ad tests as well, but we're really shown separate, almost like we carved out the different product and we showed that this could work and then we brought it out to the main experience for everybody else. And then that was, I would say the inner workings of minus one to one. Then the scanning part really became when we started to focus on professional opportunities. So when people actually share, how do they get the right views into the experience?

(00:24:19):
We don't compete for volume, we're not in the same category of Meta in terms of the skill there, but we will compete all day long for the right people seeing your content. In fact, I think in many ways that's the most powerful part of LinkedIn. How do we make sure that it's professionally productive and safe conversations? How do we trade off bad engagement all day long? In fact, when we started shifting the AI objective from click through into more downstream conversations, spammers actually took notice as well. So they were jumping over the LinkedIn bandwagon, so we had to spend a lot of time removing bad activity from LinkedIn, but that's been the evolution of this process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That is amazing. There's so much I want to dig into here. Okay, so this two million user carve out that you did, basically everyone was just like, what the hell are you doing to our metrics and goals? You're causing all this trouble for the business. Why is this team hurting our metrics? So that was basically a group that those two million users are the only ones that saw this new updated feed and were they removed from everyone else's metrics so they weren't fluctuated as much or was it just?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:26):
They could be kept in the overall because it wasn't as important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
It was a small percent?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
Okay. Got it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
But for us, they were like the world we were basically able to prove with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):
Got it. Okay. That's so smart. Okay, so basically you just decided we're only going to move your metrics a little bit, worst case if we stick to it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:41):
I felt that I tried for a few months to play on the overall experience with everybody, but it was really hard, almost like impossible because you have an organization that is so tied into how things work that I was just hitting walls after walls after escalations and it was just unproductive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:00):
And this is before you were a chief product officer where you could have just said, "We will take this bet. We know this might hurt metrics short-term"?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:07):
Okay, got it. That makes sense. Okay, the other piece, so just like lessons I'm taking away from trying something like this that's an ambitious bet within a company, is put a PM and a team on it with a goal that feels like a core part of the success of just like somebody's ass is on the line to doing this thing.

Tomer Cohen (00:26:23):
Always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Always, with focus on this one problem. And then there's the way you described there's this goal for this feed, but how did you actually try to turn that into a goal or metric or a KPI, what was that in the end, was there something there?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:35):
Yeah, this is an interesting one, one thing we've done actually because the feed is the first thing you land on. I can't just count how many folks engage with the feed because then I'm counting bypassers kind of thing and bystanders that are actually coming into the experience. So we actually started to look at the more, we go a lot into active, engaged and high value engagement. So we go downstream, we kind of put the onus on looking at more downstream engagement there and we build that as the feed engagement. So really trying to show that we're not just counting some overall whatever it is [inaudible 00:27:09] or sessions at the top level. That's not really helpful because any shifts can help there, but really setting targets for that. There's obviously it's a marketplace, so there's the creation side, there's the consumption side's, there's making sure that's healthy and engaging.

(00:27:23):
There was so much we went into that, but I think the best thing was it's almost like you carve out. I think when you do minus one to one, it's really hard unless the CEO says I don't care about how the company performs for the next two years, we're going to go for it. If you want to keep the site keep growing and the experience keep growing, carving out and almost like sending very specific unique metrics but then could easily be extended out once you show it was in retrospect the right way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
And then to give people a glimpse into the way your brain works to identify this is a big opportunity. So you talk about just like I see there's a lever that we're not investing enough in and I see this big opportunity to grow of LinkedIn. How did you decide I need to go and bet on this thing and lead this team and I think feed is a huge opportunity?

Tomer Cohen (00:28:10):
I start from beliefs a lot. So I start from what do I believe this could be or where I actually came to LinkedIn this way. In fact my biggest change in my career was when I moved here and I shifted to more like what do I care about? What am I excited about? What do I have conviction on? I think it's really hard to be a strong product leader without having strong conviction about something. So I start there and in fact coming to LinkedIn as an example, when I came into lead mobile, LinkedIn was a desktop first company, then mobile team was an offshoot of entrepreneurs. I came from a startup that I ran and it wasn't a big, it wasn't, it was like, okay, I want to do mobile, I guess fine. It's like noise at this point. Same with feed. And same when I shifted into ads, I felt really strong about the ability to flip that into a great way for companies to grow.

(00:29:04):
So for me it starts with a conviction of where things could go, what do I believe in? I believe LinkedIn can be an incredible superpower and daily use case for every professional in the world. I believe knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange is the most amazing way to grow your career and to grow your business. So that needs to be a strong pillar of the experience, what didn't exist before and what is better than the feed experience, the home [inaudible 00:29:32] to actually build it. So I don't get attached to what did not work in the past. That's not, I don't know, maybe it's a mistake sometimes, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
How do you actually make time to think like this? A lot of people are listening. They're just like, "Okay, I want to think about what could this become?" Is this just the way brain works? You're always thinking what could this be? Do you set time aside to think quarterly or yearly, what could this be if we really made this amazing?

Tomer Cohen (00:30:02):
It's a good question. I haven't thought about it. It's like a process I do. I don't sit time aside for this, but I'm very reflective. I try to focus, love the conversations on the dream, what ultimately are we trying to achieve? I think LinkedIn has a great process called vision to values that started from our former CEO, Jeff Winner, which is like if you said this is for company or for a product, which is if you're successful, what change would happen in the world? Which I love. It's just a great phrase. It's just a great empowering phrase. So I actually tend to spend a lot of my time there. I'm also very optimistic in nature. Again, sometimes it's probably, I'm not best for any role perspective. You want somebody a bit more pessimistic about the future, but I tend to lead with beliefs versus evidence. I try to prove my beliefs with evidence, but I don't lead with evidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):
Awesome. Okay. And then maybe just one more tactical question about this shift that I wish I could spend hours on because it's so interesting, the success you had making the feed so engaging. Is there anything tactically that would just like wow that would really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post and share interesting content, like a feature or a part of the strategy that really made the feed social?

Tomer Cohen (00:31:21):
I think the lesson would be, for me that was the biggest learning going into AI first that gave me the why is AI so core and why I got to make it a priority all the way to my role today to make sure the rest of the organization thinks AI first. The understanding is is that in a marketplace, if I'm able to satisfy your need on the other side, then it's magic. So ultimately it came down to AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's run separate from the team. And in a marketplace it's all about value exchange. And if I'm able to do value exchange really well, then people will come back and they do and they engage and actually they come back even more and they spend more time. So for me it was that depth into AI first as the engine that moves the whole organization forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):
Got it. So essentially making sure the content you are seeing is the most engaging you could see based on using AI to make the algorithm really smart?

Tomer Cohen (00:32:21):
On both sides. If you are the creator, if you're the person sharing, remember this was a while back, I think it was about the former Olympics and person shared an article on LinkedIn about how they should not call it Olympics, they should call it the commercial Olympics because it's all about commercials and less Olympics. And then they sent me this amazing screenshot about how NBC execs who were covering the Olympics were rearing the post, this first to them was gold. It was like, "Oh my god, my content is influencing, people are seeing it, people that matter." So that was really key. Making sure that when you share something, you share your expertise. The right people on the other side are relevant to your content and they see it. That could make your day or your week or actually it could make your living in many ways. And then on the receiving side, when I come in, it's the things I'm excited about seeing.

(00:33:17):
It's the things that are relevant, the reason your content resonates so much with other people, I can actually take your podcasts and I can apply them at work. What could be a better way to learn? I'll give you another example, which was very, very recent. I met with a known professor in this field and he shared with me how over the last year and a half he started using LinkedIn because somebody told him, "You have a great content, why don't you just post it?" I was like, "I don't want to post on social media." I'm like, "Oh, LinkedIn is different, share on LinkedIn." And he was like, "I post daily. I have so much content over the years, I post daily."

(00:33:51):
And he was like, he basically told me this is unbelievable in terms of economic opportunity I'm getting. He's like, "I'm getting speaking engagements that are roughly half the salary I make in a year here at the university. Just by people seeing this content and getting to the right people. I was invited to advise prime ministers on their investment strategy for the country and I've been teaching for 20 years, but this platform just completely elevated my ability to reach and influence people." That's the magic and that's the value exchange and that's the kind of matchmaking at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
Amazing. That's an awesome story. This episode is brought to you by Merge, product leaders. Yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration, they're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS, organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product or HRIS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customer's employees. And yes, if you need AI ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.

(00:35:38):
I want to shift a little bit in talking about this AI first mindset that you've touched on a lot. So you talked about how at the beginning of this investment, you've already been focused on AI before it was as hot as it is today, and I've heard from many people that you're really big on getting people to shift to this mindset of being very AI first. Clearly it's worked really well at LinkedIn. I'm curious just what that actually looks like. I know you could be like, "Hey guys, we got to be AI first, AI, AI, AI." But it's different to actually make people really think differently. How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?

Tomer Cohen (00:36:14):
I can spend days on this. This is so important. It's actually so important for me, it's a key focus for me. Actually to your point, long before it became cool to talk about AI in the last two years, and in fact I think I've learned this on myself. So when it comes to the feed, I took the role of the AI product leader, it didn't exist in the company. There was no person that was ever from a product perspective thinking about AI. I think it start with the belief, like we talked about before, I think every technological revolution has dramatically changed the way we build. And AI arguably is the biggest one in our lifetimes. And when I say AI first, it's not about a tech, it's a mindset. It's a start with strategy. It is rare. Maybe now you'll see it, but it was rare two years ago to see anybody in their strategy talk about the role of AI and how they build with AI.

(00:37:02):
Then it goes to the product and then the talent itself you hire, do they actually think this way? The analogy I would give to people is imagine a river rafting boat and you have everybody on the sides holding the pedals and adding accuracy, adding speed, but there's the guide on the back and they're holding those two pedals. Those two pedals navigate pretty much the boat and those pedals are AI and the guide better be you. And in most cases in companies the guide was somebody else, it wasn't the product leader. So then the question is, if AI actually is directing your product or success and it's the biggest factor and you as the product leader is not the one holding those two pedals, what are you doing? And then I realized that it was a bit of a lack of education in that, there was actually most product users used to think of AI as this black box, magic spells that they don't know how it's working so they're delegating.

(00:38:01):
And obviously that's as far from the truth as possible, but there's so many ways to unpack it. When it came to the feed where I push for example, more specifically for the teams, he doesn't stay as an AI first, there's the objective. I would ask him, "What is the objective of the algorithm?" I would challenge you to ask folks more in the folks who are leading products specifically with algorithms inherited built into them, what is the objective of the algorithm and can you write it down for me on a board? They should be able to do so, ultimately it's a mathematical formula and then it's like what features have you added to the algorithm? And this is not user features, this is specifically what parameters to learn on and then what investment do you have in data collections and fine-tuning?

(00:38:49):
Now everybody talks a big game about fine-tuning but again, two years ago, fine-tuning was something that the product folks thought the engineering team was supposed to do. No, it's the whole organization. In fact, you can build a whole strategy just on data collection and fine-tuning and your product will see tremendous success or you can delegate it and it will never happen. So in many ways that was bringing into the fold, in our phase one, which really started around 2016 for me and every team I went to, the AI component was the area I spent most of my time on. I hired people for that. Product leaders, I spent most of my, back to how do I spend my resources, most of my resources there. And it was my top priority all the way from strategy to talent. And ultimately with the last couple of years we've seen this metamorphosis of AI and this incredible new wave and we've done a pretty big change there as well over the last two years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:49):
I love this. So I took some notes on what you're talking about. So the big message that I'm taking away so far is as a product leader, you need to think about things that you thought the engineering leader had to think about or the ML engineer was thinking about things like what is the objective of our algorithm? What are the features that we're building into it? What is the data collection strategy? How are we fine-tuning it? As a PM, you should be asking these questions.

Tomer Cohen (00:40:13):
In fact, you should go all the way to infrastructure. You can have massive lifts in your product outcomes and goals if you probably enhance your infrastructure. How many product people talk about the infrastructure they have? Not many. Influencers, those are things ultimately your goal is to win with your products and build a much more experience to your members and customers. Literally just changing the infrastructure on top of what you build. That could be the biggest lever than you building another button or experience for your members on the top of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):
So say the PMs at LinkedIn, are you encouraging them all to, how is AI integrating into what you're doing? How do you just set this up so that teams do this well within LinkedIn?

Tomer Cohen (00:40:57):
Yeah. So coming into this role in early 2020, we basically established an AI academy. Every PM had to go through training just like we did mobile in 2014, we moved the whole organization to be mobile first, so everybody had to go through this process. I spent a lot of time in my reviews on the AI strategy, the objectives. We make sure there's actually AI practitioners on the product side who are strong, who can teach. So we in waves started to build more of expertise and distinguished leaders across that can actually bring this learning across the board. And then in fall 2022, when we all know what happened, at least a few months after, but we started early, we completely changed our entire almost product operations and portfolio so we can focus on this new wave of AI with LLMs in the front.

(00:41:47):
So LinkedIn has been working with AI very closely since the early days, but mostly as a matchmaker. So it was the matchmaker for our marketplaces. Somebody looks to hire this dream candidate and then you have a candidate looking for the dream job and AI would be the one doing the matchmaking. We talked about the knowledge sharing on the feed. It happens in our commerce platform as well. But AI, I was in the background so I never saw it, it was making those matches. And then with the new level of AI, we actually brought AI from the back of our marketplaces really as the matchmaker to the front. And one of the things we've done there was really asking the teams to completely revisit their entire roadmap.

(00:42:35):
This is fall of 2022, the world will learn about ChatGPT for several in March 2023. So we had a nice beginning there in terms of getting started. And the goal there was let go of what you've built, let go of your roadmap, go back to the drawing board with what are you trying to solve for, back to that idea of clarity on your problem statement and now tell me what's the solution. That's very much AI first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:03):
It reminds me, so one of the folks I pinged about you, Shira Gasarch, she used this quote about you, "Maybe you were made for such a time as this." And it connects to a lot what you're talking about where you've been thinking a lot about. And back then it was called machine learning. It wasn't called AI for a long time and now it's AI. The fact that you've been on this so long is just a perfect synergy for now. It's working its way into everything.

Tomer Cohen (00:43:27):
Here's an example that I think sometimes to bring it to people in a more visceral way if you've been building products, product leaders are used to very much dictate the experience they're building. I want this experience to be exactly like this. I want the member to come from here and this is the options they have and I want them to be able to select this and this will be my default and I want the onboarding to progress this way. And I think this is one of the biggest shifts with this when you become an AI first leader, is that there's a realization that you don't control the experience anymore, you control the ingredients. It's almost like being a chef at the restaurant and you're used to deciding every part of the dish. You're deciding everything from the ambiance to the temperature of the broccoli and then this new technology comes in and say, just give me the ingredients, give me the guidelines of how you cook and now I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it for you.

(00:44:24):
For many folks, this is a very scary feeling, they're not used to letting go of the control. Obviously you build safety guards and responsible AI around it and that's super critical. But at the essence of it, AI is not deterministic. So giving it the rope to learn and do that experience for you ultimately would become much, much better. You have to have that belief going into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Along those lines, I'm curious if there's anything you do to avoid, everyone's like, cool AI into everything and then all these stupid things ship, then no one wants. I saw this hilarious meme of like, oh wait, we built a kind of dumb artificial person. Let's integrate it into everything. Now it's everywhere. Is there anything you've learned about just how not to ship stuff that isn't great?

Tomer Cohen (00:45:11):
I can tell you what we've done here and we've failed a lot, but we learned so much along the way. When we started it in fall 2022, literally started with me calling the leaders coming to the room and we talked about, okay, let go of your roadmaps, like what we've done, great, but I want to let go of the roadmaps and I want to instead go back to what you're trying to solve for and let's meet in a couple of weeks and tell me how you're thinking differently about what you're trying to solve for knowing we have this technology in a role for us. So that was a starting point around just setting out some ground and principles around it. But we didn't start with new objectives to solve. So it wasn't like, "Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?" It was like go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?

(00:46:00):
The second part is we actually allowed teams to run to really inspire creativity. I didn't want to contain them. I wanted to get them really excited about the potential here. And even some things we're building duplicates for a while of similar ideas but done differently because part of it was I was learning. I was very excited to see what people would come up with and see how they can do it. And there was no playbook for building this really, really well. And in many ways we were writing the playbook. Prompt engineering became a playbook internally for us, which every day was amazing. How do you cognitively reverse engineer the brain a little bit? That was incredible. In fact, a lot of things we've learned so much ahead of the market and even shared with OpenAI and shared with Microsoft. But then after that period of just everybody getting excited and building, we basically brought it down and we did top-down got it.

(00:46:53):
So we basically picked back to the objectives we had out of everything that we've seen, those for us look like the best four biggest best we want to want to aim for and we want to converge resourcing across it. So no more everybody's building whatever they want. We also, capacity is also constraint. Cost is a constraint. We want to start bringing them together. So we really much allowed people to, I would say in many words, diverge. But then I would say several weeks after converge, but we had a lot more excitement and understanding about how this thing works and what we can actually do with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):
Love that advice. Basically give people a bunch of time and space to explore and experiment R and D and then as a top-down strategy, pick through this.

Tomer Cohen (00:47:40):
The top-down, we were like, there was literally, usually I do product jams for every multiple topics we have throughout the quarter. I just did every week. I just reviewed the five bets we had on a reputed basis, nothing else. Because it was so important for them to understand that this is what I care about and we had to be focused about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
It feels like that space to explore and go crazy is important because otherwise people at the company are going to be like, "Oh, I wish, there's so many, this thing I want to try with AI, we should try it." And they'll just be pissed because they don't have time to work on it.

Tomer Cohen (00:48:11):
It's a great point. It wasn't my intention, but I love that you're saying it. It's a great point because I think it gives them that. I was actually, for me sometimes almost in a, maybe too much, but I try to focus on learning. I was trying. I knew just going like this, we weren't going to learn a lot, but having people come back and trying different things and slightly going crazy and pushing the boundaries, we would learn so much. So for me it was learning, but I love the motivation around, also allowing them to have the energy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:39):
It relates to another point that a recent podcast episode I had with Brian Chesky where he introduces chaos sometimes when things are feeling too comfortable, when roadmaps, everything's calm, everything's on schedule. He's just like, "How do we do this in one day versus in two weeks? Let's just see what happens."

Tomer Cohen (00:48:56):
Yeah, because I think people get, there is just inertia, people get into their, it's human behavior, people get into their lanes, they start to feel really comfortable within the lanes, and then they don't know that there's a different way to do things and you have to almost externally invoke that or trigger that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):
If we think about just your career arc, I'm zooming out a little bit. You helped create the mobile experience on LinkedIn. You built the feed initially and now you're in front of AI. I could see why you're so successful at LinkedIn. I was talking to folks about your career arc at LinkedIn and you basically went from senior PM to senior PM number two, to group PM to director, to senior director to VP, to CPO in not that many years, it's a pretty meteoric rise. I wanted to spend a little time here and I want to maybe start with the question of just if you could give one specific piece of advice for someone looking to advance in their career based on what you found to be really effective, what would that be?

Tomer Cohen (00:49:53):
I realized everybody's in every stage in their career and they have different ways to think about the role then what they need. Maybe I'll just share about my journey, what worked for me instead of giving more of a general advice. First of all, I feel super fortunate I'm building. That's what I love doing. I love building, I love working with builders. Sometimes I'm like, I get paid for this, this is insane. But I love my craft and I love getting deep into it. So in many ways I think the things I'm excited about is the things I'm doing. When people are starting off, I usually really focus on learning from great people. People you talk to or have amazing mentors and managers. Some of them don't even know there were every mentors. It's not like a mentor officially. I try to pick up things from people all the time, and that's been just a remarkable experience working with great people.

(00:50:50):
And in many ways, a lot of those great people actually allowed me or empowered me to take on some bigger challenges. So I can see forks in the road where if it wasn't for that person saying something very specific, probably would've done something differently. And it just made me think a lot. So I really tried to absorb learning from great people. But by far, for me personally, again, this is very personal versus generic advice, it was when I moved here, I was an engineer for many years before I moved here for graduate school in 2008. And I always loved building, that was there from a young age but when I moved here, I realized my career path was very much dictated by one thing. It was like, what's most in demand? What's most challenging? And how do I do that? It was very childish in many ways.

(00:51:42):
It was not dictated by me, it was in a way dictated by society. So what's the toughest engineering role? What's the best company to go into? What's the best army unit to serve in? And I fell a lot along the way, but I always kept going. And then when I came here, there was a really big challenging for me personally around what do I care about? What matters most to me? And that was, again, it's very personal in many ways. It was very much for me, an impact on learning and actually how do I create impact more broadly? And I shifted 180 in how my thought process used to go. It was less about what was out there and exciting and in demand and challenging and it was more about where did I have strong conviction on, what was I passionate about and where did I feel I could make a dent and learn?

(00:52:35):
And that was my path forward. So after school with a student visa and massive school debt, I decided to start a company which was not a very intelligent decision based on my economic circumstances, but I didn't care. I was like, this is my new path. And then I got into LinkedIn. I didn't apply for a job. I met with who was in my role today, Deep Nishar, at that time and we talked and I said, "This is how I think this is how LinkedIn mobile should be built." And he was like, "Okay, how about you come and build it?" I was like, "Amazing." So I didn't apply to LinkedIn and then at LinkedIn I was always like, this is what I want to do, this is what's exciting for me and this is the dent I think I can make and this is my plan for it.

(00:53:21):
I don't know if this is a recommendation for everybody, but for me it's worked really, really well. It was really pursuing the conviction I had and my excitement and bring that to the fold with people. I do think that in products, in building product, if you're not genuinely excited about what you want to build, you don't have conviction about it, it's going to be very hard for you to make a big impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):
That's also a similar theme from my most recent podcast with Vlad of just, if you don't actually buy into the mission of the place you're working on, you're not going to have a good time.

Tomer Cohen (00:53:54):
Yeah. Say for product people, it's a very fortunate position. I always tell people, if you're in one of the most fortunate positions you can have, because if you just measure thing, for you, just measure based on your career and so on, people are going to evaluate you based on your actual work. It's a very special place. Nobody cares about your title, who cares? It's not. Maybe the company name for some people matters, but for the most part, it's about the impact you created with the products you've built. If I think about somebody's resume, I think if it was a product resume, it would be the products you built and the impact you had with it. I don't care about the companies you worked at, I don't care about the logos, I don't care about the titles. Slightly, again, not to overextend, but somebody, it's almost like an artist, right? It's like whatever, a musician, it's the albums you took out and how well they did. And I think for product people, it's a very fortunate place to be that you get measured based on the impact you had.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
It sounds like a LinkedIn feature idea right there. I feel like if there's any company that could make that happen, it'd be you guys. So some of the takeaways here essentially is try to index towards what are you actually excited about and motivated to work on and driven by versus where it's the most amazing company to work at are the most challenging problem.

Tomer Cohen (00:55:17):
Yeah, I think sometimes great companies have great opportunities for you to have dent at scale, but you need to be the one doing it. If you are thinking about, I don't know, a title or that did not, once I did the change into my excitement around impact, that's been at least my yardstick. When I look at people that I talk to or interview internally, the first thing to my mind to me is like, "What did you build and what did you learn and how well did they do?" That's what I care about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:50):
I imagine there's also people on the other side where all they do is work on things that really exciting to them and they could use a little pushing towards the other direction of what's actually important in the world.

Tomer Cohen (00:55:59):
100%. If you tell me, again, everybody has their different, if you tell me, "Hey, you can work on something super exciting, but it's on the fringes of the company or you can work on something which is a bit more grindy, but it's on the core of the company." The latter, no doubt, for me, impact first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):
And just listening to the story you've told of the things you decided to focus on as a clear example that you saw, hey, there's this huge opportunity in the feed, I'm going to go tackle that or mobile. So I think there's a lot of, it's kind of this Venn diagram is what I'm taking away of just what's important, what am I excited about?

Tomer Cohen (00:56:36):
Yeah, this for me. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:38):
Awesome. Okay, so I note you got to run relatively soon, so we're going to get to our very exciting lightning round. But before we do that, is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks to know or leave them with? I know we covered a bunch of things already.

Tomer Cohen (00:56:52):
Yeah. One thing that actually I've now built it into a podcast, but something I'm really excited about is I don't think there's one way of building. Remember when the Steve Jobs biography came out, everybody read it. Oh, that's the way to build and that was unique to him. And one of the things I love a lot is when I look at great builders, they're all very distinct, they're all different. And I used to do this thing internally, I used to invite product builders of different disciplines and have a fireside chat with them. And I saw people across the company join not just PMs or designers, but folks across and I build that into a podcast.

(00:57:34):
I love your podcast. Mine is very different. It's more around what is their edge a little bit. This is from the co-founder of Pixar, Ed Catmull, to the CPO of Canva or Spotify, Roblox, but all the way to a chef, Dan Barber, who's the number one chef in the US for many years. And it's just everybody has their craft and they do it differently. It's called BuildingOne, I'm excited about it. It's a little bit of a plug right now, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):
Please. Yeah. Where do people find it? Let's blow it up. It's called BuildingOne?

Tomer Cohen (00:58:07):
BuildingOne on Apple or Spotify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):
Perfect.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:11):
It's short and it's really about showing you different disciplines from a chef to an animation director. And really the main learning there is everybody builds differently and you can be very successful, but it's very authentic to how they are personally, and it's how they push their craft to the limit. It's how well they've done their craft.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:29):
I love that. And something I super believe is just the power of focusing on your strengths and the things that make you a little different versus trying to become good at everything.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:37):
100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):
That's so cool. Okay, BuildOne. We'll link to it in the show notes.

Tomer Cohen (00:58:42):
BuildingOne, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:43):
BuildingOne. BuildingOne. Okay. Amazing. And it's on all the podcasting platforms. Okay, great. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Tomer Cohen (00:58:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:51):
All right. First question is, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Tomer Cohen (00:58:57):
So I have this [inaudible 00:58:58] continuously, actually it's these three.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
I love that you have them right there.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:02):
I can just tell you about them but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:03):
They look very [inaudible 00:59:04] back there. Don't [inaudible 00:59:05]

Tomer Cohen (00:59:05):
I'm not going to destroy my study. So I love fundamentals. I love studying from fundamentals. So if you're somebody who starts in your career, my fundamental books is One Mindset. It's about growth mindset. It's about basically the ability to continuously grow over time in one sentence is the whole idea is our skills, our abilities are malleable, we can completely develop them, we can build expertise and craft and mastery and it's really a mindset change. And Carol Dweck wrote the book, was also my wife's manager, and that's how we got into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):
That's awesome.

Tomer Cohen (00:59:38):
So that's like our second religion at home. Second book is Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. I love behavioral economics. When I think about products, I think I always start from people, what is the member expectation? What are they trying to do? And this is the Bible for behavior. So if you're building front end products or even you're thinking about how you rally organization, it's an incredible book. Every page is like a stopper. You have to stop and think. And then lastly, and on the fundamental side is High Output Management by Andy Grove. It's like there's so much basics to doing good manager. It's like I think after you read this book, your managerial skills should start from a B. and then you can over time become an A. But beginning to a B is just a level of putting the effort in and knowing the best practices. So I think those are all fundamentally great books that I really like to give to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
That's awesome. I love that they're right there behind you. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Tomer Cohen (01:00:47):
Yesterday I saw Bluey, you know Bluey?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:49):
I've heard of Bluey. My kid is not old enough for it yet.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:52):
Oh, you're in for a treat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
Okay.

Tomer Cohen (01:00:54):
I love Bluey. So Bluey is this animation series from Australia and what's beautiful about it's, I can watch it with my six-year-old, nine-year-old and 12-year-old, and we're all going to enjoy it. We're all going to laugh at the same point but at the nuance of the jokes. It's like when I think about a product, the way Bluey is built, it's built for the whole family, but it's built as layers. There's layers of dialogue and points that they're trying to get across, and it's all packaged together into one experience. So for me, it's amazing that I could sit next to my six-year-old daughter, we would both laugh at this, it's a sweet animation kind of thing, it's like a family of dogs. And she would laugh at the nuance of the point, at a different nuance. For me it's like that's a genius creation of how you build a product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:50):
Speaking of Ed Catmull, the Pixar does that really well as well.

Tomer Cohen (01:01:50):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):
And I feel like the story of Bluey is really incredible too. It's just like a random little independent group and they just are making tons of money with it.

Tomer Cohen (01:02:02):
It's just amazing. The dialogue there is one, it's slightly edgy but not too edgy. It's exactly right. It's just exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
Okay. Makes me want to watch it. Okay. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's physical or in digital?

Tomer Cohen (01:02:17):
So I like playing guitar. It's amateur, I'm not that good, but I love playing it. And there is a combination I've done recently I really like, there's a Spark Amp I have, which allows me to play with effects easily, but that's not what I use it for. I can tune my guitar based on the specific song I like. See, if I want to do Pink Floyd or Metallica or Nirvana or David Bowie, I can get that tune easily. I don't have to be an expert. I can just download the tune to my guitar, which is so great.

(01:02:49):
And then I couple that with the, it's called the Ultimate Guitar app, and basically it doesn't give me the chords and the tabs, it gives me the other instruments, so I can get the drums going. I can get the, it's a violin going, whatever that is that's going in the band. As somebody who does not play so well and plays for itself and nobody's supposed to listen to how I'm playing because it's really just a way for me to enjoy my time. It's just an amazing, I would never get into any band, so this is the closest I can get to get to a band. So I love that combination.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:22):
I wish we could close this podcast episode with you playing your guitar, but [inaudible 01:03:26].

Tomer Cohen (01:03:26):
I don't know if that will help the ratings of the show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):
No, man, that's amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life, share with folks?

Tomer Cohen (01:03:38):
From growth mindset there's a motto that I really like. It's called becoming is better than being. It's like the moment you think you achieved something is the moment you start to deteriorate down. It's like we're really trying to grow as human beings. We're trying to learn, we're trying to evolve. Product is a good example. I think the moment you think you actually mastered it is the moment that you become obsolete. So I love the idea that becoming is a better goal than continuously trying to reach some kind of level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:06):
Love that. Final question, just to come back to LinkedIn. Is there a fun feature of LinkedIn people don't know about or should check out? Is there anything new that's like, oh, that's something you should try or that's something that might surprise you about LinkedIn these days?

Tomer Cohen (01:04:19):
Maybe I'll give a couple so I don't have to pick the best right off the bat. But one right now, we're heavily invested in video and it's doing so well for those creators. We talked about it like immersive video we can actually come in. We talked about for us, video is obviously a best practice right now in the industry, but on LinkedIn, the right views really matter. So highly encourage creators to think about their video play at LinkedIn. And then I think what we call our coach experience in some cases is so powerful. For job seekers out there, we have people hired on LinkedIn, there's like seven folks hired every minute. Job seeking is a lonely journey.

(01:05:02):
I was actually in a session recently meeting with job seekers and I was talking to them and one started crying midway into the session because they said, "I cannot share my journey with anybody because I feel like I'm alone in this. People don't get how hard it is. I feel very accomplished, but I can't get the job. And I wish there was a buddy, I wish there was something that I could talk to brainstorm with who wouldn't judge me, who would just be trying to help me without paying hundreds of dollars to a coach of some sort. I don't have that money."

(01:05:38):
And in many ways, when we walked him through the job seeking experience, the coach experience, we build this coach aspect where you can go to any job and you can riff on the job with this really new realities LLM that is tailored to you, personalized to you, private to you, everything from your fit to how to best apply, to consulting about different opportunities, to comparing this to others, to feeling supported. So when we talk to people around, we always, I love to measure the impact of our work by emotion, when we talk to job seekers after that, it was basically the sense of I felt supported. In many ways, getting to that ability to remove the loneliness is amazing. It's a little bit like people need to, we're making it more and more visible and more and more ramped to everybody to a certain point. But that's a really powerful way to just humanize the job seeking experience for everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Awesome. And to find that it's just, is it called LinkedIn Coach or?

Tomer Cohen (01:06:40):
It's in the job. So if you go to the job tab on LinkedIn, actually just a few weeks ago, we just put it on the top. So you don't have to go to the specific job and find it, you can just start there and engage with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):
Awesome. Just to give a quick plug to a future podcast that's coming out, there's this book called Never Search Alone, that we're going to have the author on the podcast soon. And it's all about the same idea of having a buddy that helps you search for a job.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:01):
Yeah. When I think about the future of AI in the sense of belief, that relationship is going to be sacred, the relationship between AI and the human is going to be [inaudible 01:07:10]. Do you know what Nomophobia means?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):
Nomaphobia? No.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:14):
Nomophobia.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
Nomophobia. No. Being afraid of something.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:18):
It's the anxiety of being away from your phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):
I have that.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:25):
I think we all. I think we're in for AI-nophobia at that point, where you're going to get to a point where AI is going to feel so intimate, so personal that it would actually feel concerning to you to be away from it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):
Oh man, there reminds me of Friend.com, which just launched in a really fun, I don't know if you saw Friend.com, their launch video.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:44):
No, I did not.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):
Oh, man. Check out Friend.com. It's like a digital friend that just is with you all the time and you're talking to him and it's an AI.

Tomer Cohen (01:07:50):
Oh, we're just getting started. There's going to be, we're in for incredible revolution there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):
I'm excited and scared at the same time. Tomer, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. You're awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks check out stuff that you're working on? You have a course also, you have a podcast, so just give people a sense of where to find that.

Tomer Cohen (01:08:07):
Awesome. So obviously I'm on LinkedIn, reach out anytime. I read everything people send to me. I don't always reply to everything, but I read everything sent to me. And then if you want to go deep on AI first, I have two courses, they're free. I think it's a phenomenal way for you to build or starting to build your expertise, especially if you're in product. It's a great way to go deeper and not just stay on the high level parts of things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
Amazing. We'll link to all those things in the show notes. Tomer, thank you so much for being here.

Tomer Cohen (01:08:40):
Lenny. Thank you. It's our pleasure.

# A founder’s guide to crisis management | Uri Levine (Waze co-founder, serial entrepreneur)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've co-founded 10 different companies. You've been on the board of 20. You've also built two unicorns including Waze. The biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to-

Uri Levine (00:00:09):
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Anything you wanted to share around hiring and firing?

Uri Levine (00:00:23):
Every time that you hire someone new, mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, knowing what I know today, would I hire this person? If the answer is no, fire them immediately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
Let's actually talk about fundraising.

Uri Levine (00:00:37):
Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation is the first slide. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point. Now the second most important slide is the last one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze and nine other companies. He sold two companies for over a billion dollars. He's also been on 20 different startup boards, including a dozen he's still currently on. He's also advised over 50 founders and startups over his career. More recently, he wrote a book that summarizes all of his advice for founders called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, A Handbook for Entrepreneurs. In the foreword to the book, Steve Wozniak said, "This book will change your life and become your Bible if you are an entrepreneur," and I cannot disagree with that. This book is very tactical with amazing stories and walks you through the ideation phase all the way to exiting your company.

(00:01:39):
In my conversation with Uri, we chat about many of my favorite chapters, including why falling in love with the problem is so important, how to find product market fit, a really clever tactic for firing people who aren't a fit for your company, a ton of really genius tactical advice for improving your fundraising pitch and so much more. With that, I bring you Uri Levine, and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Uri, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Uri Levine (00:02:17):
Thank you. Happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:18):
Okay, so here's what I've gathered about your career, and let me know if I've missed anything. You've co-founded 10 different companies, including four you're still operating. You've been on the board of 20 companies. You've advised 50, maybe more, companies. You've also built two unicorns, including Waze, which you sold for over a billion dollars, which back then was an astronomical amount of money. It still is. So does that all sound right? Is there anything big I missed about your career?

Uri Levine (00:02:48):
That sounds about right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
I think what's really interesting to me is that from all of that experience, the biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to fall in love with the problem. It's what your book is called. You have a T-shirt that you're wearing right now that you wear on every podcast that says that exactly. Clearly this lesson has struck a big chord with you. I'm curious if there's a moment where you realize that that's the core and that's something that every founder needs to get right. Is there an aha moment or is it kind of this progressive like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is the secret."

Uri Levine (00:03:19):
I'm not sure that this is a certain moment. I think that that was evolving over time and realizing that, look, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurship journey is about value creation. The simplest way to create value is solve a problem. That's the simplest way. And in my background, I'm an engineer always looking for the simplest way, and solve a problem is the simplest way, and so this is where fall in love with the problem coming from, and people occasionally would confuse the T-shirt with the book, and now the T-shirt is about 10 or even more years old and the book is only two years old, and so I was wearing those T-shirts for a long while before I wrote the book and when I wrote the book that was obvious that this is going to be the name of the book, but they are way more into that, right?

(00:04:06):
So when you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful. But also the story that you are about to tell is way more compelling. Just imagine that we will be here in 2007, just before I started Waze, and I will tell you I'm going to build an AI crowd-source based navigation system and you're going to say, "Oh, yeah, very interesting," but you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care, and when your customer cares, they want you to be successful, and when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.

(00:04:56):
And so in that sense, fall in love with the problem is really a key to increase the likelihood of being successful. So in general, all of my startups start with a problem. Think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a better place if you solve that and then ask yourself, so who has this problem? If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution. If you follow this path and your solution works, it's guaranteed that you're creating value.

(00:05:47):
If you start with a solution, you might be building something that no one cares and that's really frustrating. So fall in love with the problem. This is where you want to start. Now this is really hard because I am getting tons of emails every week from entrepreneurs and they all start with what we are doing and I don't really care what you're doing. What I really care about is why you are doing that, and this is the problem that you solve or the value that you create or the value that you create for me. This is what really matters, right? And so if you start your story with, "Our company is," or, "Our system is," and in the recent year everything is, "Our AI system is," or, "Our AI company is." But generally speaking, if you start your story with that, you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with, "The problem we are solving is," Then you focus on the problem. If your story start with, "The value that we create for you is," then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution.

(00:09:02):
I want to follow a couple threads here because I imagine there's certain problems people fall in love with. "Amazing. I want to solve this very obscure problem for my family or a friend of mine," and then they realize this is never going to be a huge venture scale business, if that's a goal of theirs. You talked about like, make sure enough people have this problem versus just getting a therapist that's going to help you with this problem. What are some signals and heuristics folks can use to help them understand this is a big enough problem that it's really worth their time?

Uri Levine (00:09:30):
So people ask me, "So you send me to speak with users. How many?" And I will tell them a hundred. You don't need a hundred, but the hundred basically say you need to get out of your comfort zone. It's not just your close friends and family that you need to discuss that. You need to discuss that with people that you don't know. And usually what happen is, and the validation is in most cases is really clear, right? If you tell someone, "This is the problem I'm going to address," and they will tell you, "Oh, I know someone that has this problem," it's not a real problem. If they will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no. This is not the problem. The problem is," and they will give you their description of the problem. This is something that you really want to follow. So if you speak with a hundred people, but if you actually speak with 20 people that you don't know, you will get validated whether or not this problem is real or not.

(00:10:23):
And look, it's not the only way to become successful, right? You look at one of the most successful products in the world, the iPhone, right? And you ask yourself, what was exactly the problem when they started? And the answer is that there was no problem when they started. There were smartphones and people were actually very happy with them. And so occasionally we need to invent something completely new, but solving a problem is simply the simplest way to create value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):
Another element of picking a problem to work on, so you say you fall in love with a problem. Is being excited to work on this problem. There's oftentimes problems you find that aren't that exciting to you or you're not excited to work on real estate software, but you find there's a big problem. How important is it that you're personally passionate and excited to work on this thing versus like, "Oh, wow. This is a huge business opportunity. I got to go after it. It doesn't matter if I'm not that passionate about it."

Uri Levine (00:11:20):
Fall in love, right? This is really passionate. Really, really passionate. Look, the journey is really hard and complex and long and so you have to be in love in order to go into this journey because otherwise it's not going to be successful. You really want to be passionate. If you're not passionate about the problem, even though that the problem might be real and big and significant, there is not enough drive, there is not enough internal drive to take you through the hardship of the journey, and so you need to be passionate. You need to fall in love. You personally need to fall in love with the problem. And then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:05):
Is there an example of a pivot that you maybe went through where you realized the problem was not as big as you thought or you realized there's a bigger problem?

Uri Levine (00:12:13):
So actually there are many, right? So Oversee deals with maybe biggest secret in travel industry. What happened to airfare after you booked your flight? Now you have no idea because you never compare prices after you met the reservation. But you know that airfare is going up and down all the time. It's going up and down before you are making the reservation and keep on going up and down after you're making the reservation. So if this is the price that you paid and this is cancellation fees, if the price drops here, you can rebook the same flight at the cheaper price.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:48):
Genius.

Uri Levine (00:12:49):
If you would only keep on comparing prices after that, right? So we started this company that is actually monitoring your own itinerary and we realized that this is going to be huge benefits to travelers and we started that as a B2C company, direct to consumers, and we realized that even though the people really care, they are not willing to take the action that is required, and we ended up with doing that for corporates, and in corporates there are very simple ways for them to engage that automatically, so automatic rebooking and so forth, and we can save corporates about 10% of the travel budget that goes directly to bottom line. So we started that as a B2C and then we realized that this is way harder than we think it is, and we ended up with converting that into B2B, which turns out to be very successful for us. And so occasionally there are companies that you start your journey with one perception and you change that and that will happen multiple times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):
That's an awesome example. I want to, before I move on to, I'm kind of thinking about this in the phases of starting a company. So we're talking right now about coming up with the idea that you want to commit to. A lot of people that want to start companies are not sure how to find a great idea, so the core advice you're sharing is find something, find a problem, and fall in love with solving that problem in whatever way you can. Do you have any other advice for helping somebody find a problem and finding a startup idea? Where do you find startup ideas? What do you find? What does work for you mostly?

Uri Levine (00:14:30):
So for me, it's usually personal frustration that leads me to start to think about it, whether or not we can change it. I hate traffic jams, right? I hate leaving money on the table, right? So there are many things that I ran into and I get frustrated and I tell myself, "No, no, no. There must be a different way to do that." But in general, look, the problem itself needs to start from you, right? Something that really bothers you, something that you care about, and then it's the validations of the problem that you speak with many people, try to realize. Now if you'll tell me, oh, this is a B2B, then speak with many businesses, right? Speak with those that you believe actually do have this problem and I understand their perception.

(00:15:13):
Once you validate that, then there are few things that you need to realize. One is about the journey itself. This is going to be a multi-dimensional journey. It's going to be at least three dimensions and maybe fourth, right? So the three dimensions, one of them is it's going to be a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs. And look, if you'll tell me that all the businesses in the world have ups and downs, I agree, but the frequency of those when you are building a startup? Way higher. I think that I heard the best quote on that from Ben Horowitz, Ben Horowitz from Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, and before that he used to be a CEO of a startup and he was asked whether or not he was sleeping well at night and he said, "Oh, yeah, I slept like a baby. I woke up every two hours and cried." And that's really the reality of that. The frequency of the differences are so dramatic that there is nothing compared to that, a roller coaster journey.

(00:16:17):
It's also a journey of failures. Look, we are trying to build something new that no one did before, and even though that we think that we know exactly what we are doing, we don't. So we try. We try one thing and it doesn't work. We try another thing and it doesn't work. Or if we keep on trying different things until we find one thing that does work. Now, if you realize that this is going to be a journey of failures, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that if you're afraid to fail, then in reality you already failed because you are not going to try. Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed, that because you haven't tried new things before. If you're going to try new things, you will fail. Michael Jordan used to say that, "I've failed over and over and over and over again and this is what made me successful." And so this is the first conclusion.

(00:17:07):
The second conclusion is that you really want to fail fast. Just think about it, right? If you fail fast, you still have plenty of time to try another attempt and build another version of the product. Try another go-to-market approach. Try a different business model so you still have plenty of time to make more and more and more attempts, and the more attempts that you have, you simply increase the likelihood of being successful. Just think that you play basketball, right, and you try to score from half court. If you have one shot and you are not Steph Curry, you are very likely to miss. But if you actually have a lot of shots, one of them you're going to make. That's it. Just think about it. The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect. You don't need to be perfect. You need to be good enough in order to win the market, and the way that you are going to become good enough, by the way, is really simple. You start with not good enough and you iterate and iterate and iterate until you become good enough and then you'll win.

(00:18:10):
The third dimension is that this is going to be long journey. Very long. Way longer than you think it is. And the longest part of it is until you figure out product market fit, and product market fit goes into the different phases of building a company. To a certain extent, I would say, look, the difference between a corporate and a startup is that a corporate knows this is our value proposition, this is the product that we are selling, this is the pricing of this product that we are selling, this is the target audience, this is how we are going to sell them, this is how we going to the market, and all we have to do is keep on executing and hopefully nothing will change over the period of time. When you start as a startup, you don't have a product. You don't know what's the business model. You don't know what people are going to pay you for. You don't know how to grow your business, and you need to figure out all of those, and this is going to be a long journey.

(00:19:11):
Now, the longest part is usually figuring out product market fit and product market fit is really simple. That means that you create value to your customers. If you do not figure out product market fit, you will die. As simple as that. You never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died. That's it. Now, once they do, and for a second I want you to think of, with all the applications that you're using every day, right? From searching Google, using Waze, WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, whatever it is, and ask yourself what is the difference between any of those today and the first time that you have used that? And the answer is that there is no difference. We are searching Google today the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life. We're using Waze today the same way that we used Waze for the first time in their life. So once a company figure out product market fit, they don't change their product anymore because this is the value that they created to the customers and you don't want to change that.

(00:20:14):
What we don't know is how long did it take them to get to this point, right? Beforehand we never heard of them and after that they don't change that anymore. It's a matter of years. For Waze, it was four years. For Microsoft, it was five years. For Netflix, it was 10 years. Now if you'll tell me, "Oh, today is very different. ChatGPT just started a year ago." No, they're seven years old. It took them six years until you heard about them for the first time in your life. So it does take time to create value and this is something that is really significant. Now, at the end of the day, product market fit have one metric. One metric. That's it. Retention. That's really simple. If you create value, they will come back. If they're not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. Now think about your episodes, right, of this podcast, right? Most of your listeners are returning, right? Because you create value for them and they are coming back. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
100%. Every single one, every episode.

Uri Levine (00:21:29):
Occasionally there are new one, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):
And there's new ones coming in all the time.

Uri Levine (00:21:32):
[inaudible 00:21:32]. By the way, this is one thing that some businesses don't realize, whether or not their customers are going to be new customers or returning customers, and in many cases they simply fail to realize that upfront and the result is that they are not building the right go-to-market strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
We covered a lot of ground there. That was amazing. I'm going to follow a number of threads of things you just touched on. You talked about product market fit briefly. What was the moment you felt product market fit with Waze? I don't know if I've ever heard that story.

Uri Levine (00:22:09):
We started in Israel and Israel is a small place and we ended up with being very successful in Israel and then we said, "Wait a minute. Waze crowdsource all the data, right?" Not just the traffic information and speed cams and so forth, but also the map data itself, so we can start from a blank page. And the users while they drive, they create the map and they create traffic information and so forth. And so we figure out that we can start anywhere and we made Waze global at the end of 2009 and we expect that to work the same way that it did in Israel, but it didn't. It was not good enough. It was not good enough in the U.S. It was not good enough in Western Europe. It was not good enough in Latin America, it was not good enough in Asia. It was not good enough anywhere that matters, right?

(00:22:57):
It was actually good enough in about four places. In the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Latvia and Ecuador, and that's about it. Rest of the world not good enough. So what we did is we spoke with the drivers. Look, they wanted us to be successful. We basically said the drivers are going to fight traffic jams together, so common enemy, togetherness, all goodness. Everyone wanted that to work, right? So people downloaded the app and it simply was not good enough. So they churned, right, because if it's not good enough, you're not coming back. We spoke with them. We asked them what didn't work for them. They told us because they wanted it to work, and we built the next version addressing everything that they've told us, and we know that this is it, and it's not. So we doing it all over again. We speak with the drivers. We ask them what didn't work for them, they tell us. Now we build the next version and now we have the conviction that it's going to work and it's not. Journey of failures.

(00:23:58):
Iteration after iteration after iteration after iteration. More than a year of iterations until beginning of 2011 that we actually started to see that working, and then it's in multiple places. In the U.S., one metropolitan after the other, right? Los Angeles first and then San Francisco and then Washington D.C. and Chicago and New York and Atlanta and so forth. In Europe, one country after the other. Italy first and then France and Netherlands and Sweden and Spain and one country after the other. In Latin America, one country after the other. Colombia first and then Chile and then Brazil and then Mexico and then rest of Latin America. In Asia, multiple countries one after the other. Not all of them, by the way. Not all of them. Japan is a very good example where it didn't work and it will never work. Waze crowdsourced the information, right? Which basically says that as soon as we get to the level of good enough, then we are good enough.

(00:25:01):
House numbering plan. In the U.S., it's really simple, right? Every block is a hundreth numbers, right? And so if I have the map, I can actually count the number of blocks and take you to approximate the right location even if I don't have exactly all the house numbers there. Most of the western world, it's a geographical order. So in Israel, this is going to be sequential order, odd number on one side of the street, even number on the other side of the street starting from one until the end of the street and so forth, so it's enough that I will have few house numbers that I can actually take you to the right place.

(00:25:38):
In the UK, house number starts on one side off the street and then on the other side they are coming back, right? And so there is an order. In Japan, it's chronological order. The oldest house in the neighborhood is house number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Oh, wow.

Uri Levine (00:25:56):
And then the house number two can be miles away, but it's the second oldest house in the neighborhood and so you have to have all the house numbers unless... Until then you are not good enough. And crowdsource is, if you need perfect information, crowdsource may not be the right way to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):
Just to close the loop on this question, when you were launching these markets and it wasn't working, were you actually looking at retention at that point, and if so, was there a number you were looking for? Or was it more qualitative like it's just taken off off into the right. Like where were you actually watching back in the early days?

Uri Levine (00:26:32):
That was easier for us because we tried to compare everything to Israel, so we looked at the frequency of use or when our people are coming back. How long does it take them until the next try and until the next try. And in generally speaking, if you look at something that have high frequency of use, then you will be looking at three-month retentions of 30, 40, 50% is actually pretty good indication. But usually what would happen is that you would know when they convert and that's going to be after the third or the fourth time, and if they're not getting to the fourth time, then they are basically saying, "Okay. We gave it a try. We really like this story. We gave it another try, and it's not good enough."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):
That's a cool heuristic. Do you find that that is useful for other startups, consumer-type startups or is that just something you think specific to Waze at that point, this idea of coming back for the third time?

Uri Levine (00:27:29):
It's really depending on the frequency of use, right? If I will tell you that I have a startup that helps you to file your tax returns in three minutes, then okay, that's absolutely amazing, but you are only going to do that, next time is next year. By the way, we did have a startup that was doing that. It's still a little bit up and running, but that was really frustrating because the tax authority shut us down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):
You got to fall in with the problem. You got to power through that. Just change the government. Just kidding. The story you told of Waze and iterating is a really good example of falling in love with the problem. You're really passionate about. I want to solve traffic, I hate traffic. By the way, what it made me think about a little bit is Elon, when he hated traffic, he built the boring company and built tunnels underground, and your solution to hate traffic is I'm going to build Waze in a soft wrap.

Uri Levine (00:28:29):
We start Waze with the vision that we are going to help people to avoid traffic jams. Now the reality is that there are more traffic jams today than there were in 2007. Obviously, number one, I'm not done. And number two, if you ask people what is the value of Waze, then it's not about avoiding traffic. It's about creating certainty and certainty is way higher value than saving time. So you know exactly when you're going to get there and this is a way higher value. And by the way, we learned that in the U.S. market when we spoke with people. They told us, "If I am living in Cupertino and I need to drive up to San Francisco and I can take 101 or 280, I don't really want to change my route unless there is something dramatic, but what I really want to know is how long it's going to take me. So I'm going to stay on the 101. I'm not going to get into service road. I'm not going to take El Camino Real. I'm not going to try something else. I'm going to stay on the 101. Just let me know how long it's going to take." So certainty creates way more value than saving time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
I want to talk through a couple other of the chapters in your book. So chapter four is around the different phases of a startup journey and your core advice is that it's important to focus on one thing at a time in each of these phases, and the first phase, you call it the all over the place phase, I think, or yeah, the all over phase, and the idea is you need to get out of that as soon as you can and then focus. Can you just kind of talk through these different phases and what you think people do wrong along the phases? Maybe they get them wrong or they focus on the wrong things in each phase.

Uri Levine (00:30:17):
So initially you think about your new idea from multiple perspective, right? This is the problem. This is how this solution is going to look like. This is what I'm going to do next year. This is my 10 years vision. This is my business model and so forth. So you think about everything, but you actually need to execute only one thing. Now this one thing is figuring out product market fit. It's not one thing, right? Wait a minute. You also need to build an organization and you want that organization to be something that you really like and so there are a lot of operational stuff, but you need to figure out product market fit. As we said earlier, if you don't figure out product market fit, you will die. If you do, then you get to live and die another day and the other day is whether or not you're going to figure out how to grow your business and whether or not you're going to figure out your business model.

(00:31:11):
Now the good news is that I will tell you that if you create value, you will figure out a business model, at least for the people that you create value for them. They are most likely willing to pay. Now in general, I'm not saying that this is the only business model that is viable, but if you create value, you will figure out a business model. But figuring out a business model is a journey by itself, and guess what? It's going to be a long roller coaster journey of failures. When we started Waze, we thought that we're going to sell map data and traffic information and we ended up with doing advertisement. Very different business model. Because we realized that it's not for us. It's too long sales cycles. We were very mobile internet dynamic company and selling to government is not exactly what we wanted to do, and so we ended up with a different business model, but with a lot of reasoning why this is the right business model for us.

(00:32:14):
And figuring out growth, look, if I would ask a hundred people on the street, how did you hear about Waze? They, 95 of them, if not 99 of them, will tell me, "Someone told me." Word-of-mouth, right? So everyone wants to have word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth you can only have if you have high frequency of use. If you're doing tax returns once a year, even if you really like the experience, then once a year you're going to tell someone else. If you're using Waze every day, then every day you have an opportunity to tell someone else. So word-of-mouth, even though that everyone would like that, it's only going to happen if you have high frequency of use.

(00:33:01):
So those phases requires different focus of the company, right? Initially if you focus on product market fit, then you don't need sales. You have no product to sell. You don't need business development. You don't need even marketing. You need product. You need developers and you need product lead to define the product and lead through the iterations of the product until we get to the level that it's good enough. Once you get there, you shift gears. If the product doesn't change, if we search Google the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life, then the product development is now not going to be focused about value creation. It's going to be focused about either figuring out business model or figuring out scale, and the entire company shift gears and move to a different phase.

(00:33:54):
Now, this is really hard. Just think about it. If up until now the product development group was the only things that matters, all of a sudden we think about marketing now because we are now in the go-to-market phase that this is the most important thing of the company. Occasionally I found companies that have challenging and shifting gears so they didn't figure out where the clutch is and you have to because otherwise you're stuck in the previous phase that you kind of finished that journey. This journey is nearly done and you need to shift gears, and if you don't do that, then you get stuck. If you do that, if you try to do multiple things at the same time, you will fail. Focus is not about what we are doing, it's about what we are not doing. These are the hard decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
I like that. So the four phases, just to briefly summarize, it's kind of like come up with the idea, find product market fit, then it's a question of should you keep focusing on growth or should you figure out the business model before focusing heavily on growth? In your advice, it sounds like if it's high frequency, word-of-mouth driven, focus on growth and then you figure out business model later. If not, figure out how you're going to make money and then figure out growth.

Uri Levine (00:35:14):
Exactly. Because if you have high frequency of use, you will end up with growth coming by itself, right, for word-of-mouth, and therefore you should do that at the beginning. If you don't have high frequency of use, you are sentenced to acquire users or customers all of your lifetime. If this is the case, then you really want to figure out the business model before you start and go and do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):
That's really helpful. I think actually a counter example to your point about how frequency of use is necessary for word-of-mouth growth is Airbnb. Something like 70% of Airbnb growth is word-of-mouth and frequency of use is actually really low. It's like once or twice a year. I wonder if it's because the experience is so unique and special that it still works and enough people travel enough times, slash if it was a higher frequency, it would've grown even faster, I imagine.

Uri Levine (00:36:09):
High frequency of use is the simplest way for word-of-mouth. The other thing is coolness. If it's really cool, then you'll tell more people, and Airbnb was really cool at the beginning of the journey, so now everyone knows about Airbnb, but when they started that was way cheaper and really unique experience than hotels.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):
It's still actually mostly word-of-mouth. I think it was probably higher initially, but it's still almost 70, 80% driven by word-of-mouth. So it's still cool enough. Good for them. You have a couple of quotes that I wanted to share, which are along the lines of things you shared. One is just, you have this kind of, what's the most important stage at a company? They all are, but one at a time. I love that line. The other is the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. The same advice you just shared. Just like focus. So you're in the PM, product market fit phase. Focus on that. Don't think about growth yet. Don't think about business model yet necessarily. I know investors are going to push you to figure these things out and you'll have to have some story of like, "Here's how it might make money. Here's how we think we're going to grow." Right? You need to think about that a little bit, but maybe don't make that the focus.

Uri Levine (00:37:22):
So this is one of the areas that investors don't like to hear the truth, right? The truth is that I don't know how I'm going to bring the users. I will figure that out once I get there, but the reality is that right now I don't know, but they don't want to hear that. What they want to hear is that, "Oh, I know exactly how I'm going to bring them." And what I will say is that I know exactly where I'm going to start my experiments, but most of the investors would like to see a coherent story that makes sense, right? This is our business model. This is how we going to make money. This is what we're going to sell. This is how much they're going to pay. This is why it's a simple business model and these are the comparable to this business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
Yeah. But investors have the final word, unfortunately. They decide if they want to invest or not, and so if your story is not compelling, they're going to be like, "All right. We'll find someone else."

Uri Levine (00:38:13):
You know, it's seasonality, right? There are periods of time that raising capital is easier and then many of the entrepreneurs will be choosers are not beggars, and there are periods of time that is that way around, and most of the entrepreneurs will be beggars and not choosers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B.

(00:39:24):
In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to LinkedIn.com/podLenny to claim your credit. That's LinkedIn.com/podLenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:39:52):
Let's actually talk about fundraising as a topic I wanted to spend a little time on. How much money have you raised for the companies that you've started total, roughly?

Uri Levine (00:40:02):
So Waze raised about $50 million throughout the entire journey. We started by raising 12. That was the first investment round, and then we raised the 30, and then there was the last round that we raised actually not a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
That's a surprising small amount of money to raise for the outcome.

Uri Levine (00:40:28):
In general, I would say Israeli startups are leaner than American startups, so you can raise less money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
Yeah, that's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:37):
At way lower valuation, unfortunately, and end up with pretty successful results.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):
That's amazing.

Uri Levine (00:40:45):
Raising capital, it's a journey by itself and different from the other journeys that you need only once. Raising capital is going to happen multiple times. And if we say that building a startup is a roller coaster journey, then I will say raising capital is a roller coaster journey in the dark.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
It's like Space Mountain.

Uri Levine (00:41:09):
Yeah, sort of. And one of the reason is that this is a different ballgame and you don't know how to play at the beginning. I would say a few things about raising capital for the first time. Number one, I spoke with many investors and one of the conversations that I had that they really, really resonate with me was when I spoke with one of the leading VC in Israel and asked their partner, "How long does it take you to decide if you like the entrepreneur or not?" And he asked me, "Do you want the right answer or the real answer?" Say, "You know, I heard the right answer so many times, give me the real answer." And we were sitting in a small meeting room, so the guy is looking at me and then looking at the door and looking at me again and say, "It's before they sit down." Say, "Oh, no, no, no. Say that again, right?"

(00:42:02):
That's the first impression. Now we all have first impression. How long does it take you to decide if you like a candidate or not? Second, you go on a date. How long does it take you to decide if you like the date? Seconds. And then maybe there are a few more minutes that you allow yourself to either change your mind or let that first impression solidifies. Now if this is the case and you're looking to raise capital, start with the strongest point at the beginning. Whatever it is, and I don't care if this is the size of the problem. This is the faction that you have. This is the team that you have built. I don't care what it is, start with that, because by the time you'll get there, they might be already setting up their mind. Then start with the strongest point at the beginning. And by the way, finish with that as well.

(00:42:53):
So this is the first conclusion. The second conclusion is that I spoke with early stage investors, those that invest the first money in. So company has a story to tell. That's about it, right? No traction, nothing yet is built and so forth, and I asked him, "Why did you decide to invest in this company and this company and this company?" And I spoke with many investors, and what I heard was actually pretty consistent. I like the CEO. I like the story. That's it. I like the CEO. I like the story. Now if this is the case, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that the CEO goes alone to the meeting. I need the headlight on me. I don't need any distractions. I don't need my team members. I don't need anything else in the room, just me. Because if I bring other people, then at the end of the day they might say, "Yeah, I like the team, but the CEO was not specific, right? Was not unique. Was not jumping out of the pages." So CEO goes along and tell the story.

(00:44:02):
The other part is that they need to tell a good story, and good story is not about facts. It's about creating emotional engagement. It's about creating the sense that the listener would like to be part of this story. And for investor, it's two things. Number one is that they want to believe that this is usable, and number two, they want to believe that you can build it and this is the story that you need to tell. Now, I would say always start with the problem, right? Because guess what? Investors are also users. If they don't think that they're going to use it, so it's relevant for them, and they don't think that they're going to use it? They will basically dismiss that. They will basically say the market is not there.

(00:44:52):
So these are two main things. The third thing is it's a different ball game, right? So if you have product and you tell the story to potential customers, the right order of magnitude is that about one third of the listeners will buy. So in a more mature company, their pipeline is going to be three eggs in order to sell at the end of the year one eggs. One third are going to say yes. In investors, it's 1%. Not one third, 1%. So you're going to hear a hundred times no until you hear one yes. And that a hundred times no is something that you need to understand from the beginning because that's really discouraging, right? You go and speak with investors and they tell you... I call that they open up the big book of excuses why not. But in general, they are not going to invest, right?

(00:45:54):
Now you look at it from the other side, a venture capital partner is likely to see between a hundred and 200 companies a year and invest in one or two. 1%. That's it. So if this is the case, then it's going to be the same case for you. One out of a hundred. If you want to increase the likelihood, learn how to tell a good story, start at the strongest point at the beginning, remember that they are users, too, so their emotional engagement is going to come through the usage, the use case, and not through how big the business is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:34):
I love the summary at the end. I love that you summarized your points, because I try to do that. You did my job. I love this phrase you have in your book, "The dance of 100 nos."

Uri Levine (00:46:44):
At the beginning you look at it and you say, "Okay, they say they decided not to invest because of X, Y, Z," right? Whatever it is, right? Google can do that in no time or the market is not big enough or the market is complex or whatever it is, and then you try to argue, and you don't know that it's useless, right? It's like you go on a date and she said no, and you try to argue, right? No, there is nothing to argue anymore, right? That's no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):
Yeah. I look at a lot of startups too. I do a bunch of angel investing, and yeah, if it's not going to be a fit, it's just not going to work, and I could spend all this time trying to explain it to you, but nothing's going to change. And because there's other startups out there is a big part of it, right? You just want to pick the things you can that are the best, not necessarily things that are good ideas. I really like this idea of starting with your strongest point. That's such an important tactical piece of advice. To your point, investors make decisions really quickly, and so starting with something that really catches their attention, it makes so much sense because once you feel like, "Oh, wow, maybe this is a thing," your whole brain is starting to look at it from a, oh, yeah, okay, like you have a positive bend on everything you're hearing versus like, "No, no, no, this is never going to work and everything is already biased."

Uri Levine (00:48:00):
So I would add here another very strong advice. Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation. The most important slide of your presentation is the first slide, not the one that you think about it. The first slide. The one that says Company XYZ intro. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:29):
Wow, that's a good point.

Uri Levine (00:48:31):
The longest period of time in the presentation, this slide is going to be presented on the screen and you didn't say anything there. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):
I love that. Is there an example of someone that did that or did you do that, one of your startups? What do you put there?

Uri Levine (00:48:51):
I do that all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
What's an example of something you put on that slide that's such a good idea?

Uri Levine (00:48:56):
Maybe size of the market. Maybe description of the problem. Whatever it is, right, the strongest point is there. Now the second most important slide is the last one. Not the summary. The one that says thank you. That's the time to repeat that. So most of their presentations will end up with thank you and my email, right, and this is going to be the last slide, right? Which makes sense. You just missed the opportunity. This is going to be the second-longest displayed slide of the presentation. Maybe the first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:39):
Yeah. Everyone's sitting there chatting, asking you questions. That's so smart. Are there any more of these tips sitting in your head to share, because these are awesome.

Uri Levine (00:49:48):
I do a lot of public speaking and usually my last slide says one more story and I decide on the story based on the audience and the dialogue so far and so forth. But I have many of stories, many last stories that I would like to tell. The important part is that no one is going to cut you off the stage if you have just one more story, and so this is where you can recap everything. This is where you can do whatever you want, right? Because no one is going to tell you, "Okay, time is up."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):
Right, and they're not impatient because they're like, "Okay, it's almost over. Let's just let him finish."

Uri Levine (00:50:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:31):
Yeah. I love that. Speaking of stories, what's the wildest fundraising story that you've been through? Is there one that comes to mind of like, "Holy shit. I can't believe that happened," or, "I can't believe that worked out"?

Uri Levine (00:50:43):
One of the earlier startups that I was guiding was about, eventually rolled into gift cards, but in Israel, when you return something to the store, you don't get your money back. What you get is a gift card for that particular store, right, and obviously if you return something, then it's not necessarily that you have something to buy in the store and you ended up with having a gift card that is never being used, and so why not sell this gift card? What happened is that I heard the story of the CEO and I thought that the story is not good enough, and I told him, "Look, you have to tell a better story," and asked, "Can you give me an example?" And I said, "Yeah, just imagine that," and then there was a long story about the microwave stuff working, and I bought a new one and really long, long, long story about with the details, right? How do you make a story make believe? With details. Right? The more details people think that this is real. Right?

(00:51:48):
If there are no details, then this is not real. So I told him this story that was like five minutes explaining, trying to fit the microwave into the closet and it didn't fit in into the cabinet, and it didn't fit in, and I had to return it to the box and so forth and whole story. And then I spoke with an investor in Israel and I told him about this new company that I'm going to invest, and I told him the same story about this microwave, right, and he said, "This is interesting. I would like to meet the CEO." Then he met the CO and CEO told him exactly the same story about the microwave. When I tell that, this is my microwave, right?This is personal. This has happened to me. And so he told me, the investor called me up later, he said, "He told me exactly the same story." So that was really funny.

(00:52:44):
But at the end of the day, one of the things that makes story authentic is details, because otherwise it's not, right? If you're going to tell me, okay, this is the use case of the product and you end up with explaining a use case in three lines, this is not authentic. If you watch your real users, then what happens is that you actually, and you speak with them, then you have the audacity to tell a good story. Really, really critical. If you want to tell user story, these needs to be, real or you have to learn how to tell a story with many details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:29):
But interestingly, it sounds like the story itself doesn't have to have happened to you in real life. It could be a made-up story, but with a lot of details is the lesson there. Interesting.

Uri Levine (00:53:38):
Yep. If you tell it very briefly, then it doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):
Amazing. Any other advice along those lines? I want to talk about two more chapters before we wrap up. Is there anything else around fundraising that you think is important for people to know?

Uri Levine (00:53:54):
So I will tell you which chapters I would like to speak about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):
Let's do it. I wonder what they are. I wonder if they're the same.

Uri Levine (00:54:02):
Understanding users and firing and hiring.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:04):
Okay, firing and hiring. That was on my list. Okay. Let's start there and then understanding users wasn't, but I'm excited to hear what you have to say there.

Uri Levine (00:54:14):
So I send the book proposal to many publisher, and there is one chapter that says firing and hiring, and many of them came back and say, "Oh, it should be hiring and firing." And I said, "No. Firing is hard decision. Hiring is easy decisions." You have to first of all learn how to make the hard decisions. Now, the inspirations for this chapter came from many dialogues that I had with entrepreneurs that their startup failed, and I asked them, "Why, what happened?" And about half told me the team was not right, and I kept on asking, "Okay, what do you mean the team was not right?" And what I heard the most is, "We had this guy not good enough and this guy not good enough." So this is what I heard the most.

(00:54:58):
Another thing that I heard quite often is that we had communication issues, right? Something that I actually called ego management issues. And then asked them the most interesting question, "When did you know that the team is not right?" Now the answer was actually rather scary. All of them told me within the first month. Then you said, "Wait a minute. If you knew within the first month that the team is not right and you didn't do anything, the problem was not that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decision." Making hard decisions is hard. Making easy decisions. This is why no one likes to make the hard decisions, because you need to live with the consequences. In a small place like a startup, the hard decisions will always go to the top. Now, if the CEO does not make that hard decisions, the result is always the same. The top performing people would leave. Now, they would leave because they don't want to be in a place that is unable to make hard decisions and they have a choice.

(00:56:02):
The nature of the beast is different. Startup is a small organization. Just imagine that you are a small organization, like could be a team, whatever it is, right? 10, 20, 30 people, and there is someone that shouldn't be there, and I don't care if that someone shouldn't be there because they are way underperforming or because they are assholes. I don't really care. They shouldn't be there. Everyone knows. Everyone knows and the CEO doesn't do anything. That's the nature of the beast and this is why top performing people would leave. Now, building a startup is really, really hard, right? It's hard if you have the right team, but if you have people that shouldn't be there that are still there and the top performing people are leaving, then it's going to be mission impossible. The conclusion of this chapter is really, really interesting. If everyone knows within a month and every time that you hire someone new, what I really want you to do is mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?"

(00:57:16):
At the end of the day, I'd like to nail that into yes or no, right? Because this is where decisions are being made easily. If you ask yourself that question, if the answer is yes, then go to this person and tell them that you are really excited that they've joined, they are exceeding your expectations, and give them more equity, and you buy their loyalty for life. If the answer is no, fire them immediately. They're already set on a trajectory of not being successful and they're creating damage to you, to the rest of the team and to themselves, right? They deserve to be successful, but it's not going to happen here. They deserve to find someplace else that they can be successful, but it's not going to happen here, and that decision is really, really dramatic.

(00:58:08):
Now, in many cases with hard decisions, we know what is the right decisions. We are looking for confirmation. If you look for confirmation, then go and speak with the top performing people and tell them, ask them the following, right? "Assuming XYZ person is going to leave, how sore are you going to feel?" And you will be surprised that they are going to tell you, "Oh, it's not a big deal." This is your confirmation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:40):
Yeah. We had Elizabeth Stone from Netflix, the CTO of Netflix on, and she talked about this thing they called a keeper test, which is exactly that, where every manager is always asking themselves, "If this person were to leave tomorrow and tell me they're leaving, would I fight to keep them? And if not, I should just, I need to let them go," and that's always top of mind for managers there.

Uri Levine (00:58:59):
You know, one of my companies had a pretty good year and they decided to have an annual bonuses by and large to nearly all of the employees. And then I asked the CEO, "So how did you end up with the list?" And he said, "Okay. We had these people that getting twice as much the others, and then the others, and then there are four people that are not going to get anything." And I asked them, "Are they still here?" They shouldn't be here, right? If they are so much underperforming, then they shouldn't be here. But generally you need the time to ask yourself the tough questions because only then you can answer them, right? If you don't ask the tough questions, then you don't answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):
Yeah. I really love this very tactical piece of advice, which I was definitely going to touch on, of putting a calendar entry into your calendar when you hire someone 30 days in to remind yourself, asking yourself, "Would I hire this person knowing what I know now? And if not, you should probably let them go."

Uri Levine (01:00:06):
By the way, I can tell you that for everything in your life, right? Everything in your life, ask yourself, "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):
Wow.

Uri Levine (01:00:17):
If the answer is yes, then do something different today. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):
That is powerful advice. So what I'm thinking there is if I bought something, maybe return it. What else have you applied that to in your life?

Uri Levine (01:00:31):
Relationship in general. Directions that you're going, right? Do you still like that? I have five children and they're all in their twenties and beginning of thirties and they struggle with their career path, and I basically tell them, "Look, if you are going to work in a place and you don't like it, then what I want you to do is ask yourself why you are not liking it and whether or not there is something that you can change, and I'm going to ask you the same question in 90 days from now, and if this still is the case, then quit."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):
It's interestingly you make that 90 days, which it kind of applies some decisions. You need to wait a little bit more. You need more data. You need more time than necessarily 30 days, but set some kind of timeline.

Uri Levine (01:01:24):
If you don't set a timeline, it'll never happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):
I think the other really interesting implication here is most decisions are a two-way door. Most decisions, you can change your mind. You can quit. You can leave a relationship. I was thinking you were going to say with your five kids 30 days after they're born, "Do I still want this kid 30 days with knowing what I know now?" I'm glad you didn't go there.

Uri Levine (01:01:52):
No, this is different, right? You go into this journey of having children with the understanding that this is long journey. Go into this journey of building a startup with the understanding that this is a long journey, right? The fact that it's going to be hard? Okay, so it's hard. It is hard, by the way. But yeah, the decisions that obviously they need to be relative to their duration, right? So yeah, raising kids is a long journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
And a one-way door, also. Is there anything else you wanted to say around the hiring and firing concept? Clearly firing is the main lesson here, is get really good at firing, firing quickly and decisively.

Uri Levine (01:02:41):
You know, there are tons of advices in the book and eventually I will tell, even in the hiring process, right, most of us are going to interview candidates and then decide that they like or dislike the candidate, but they don't know. Then speak with someone that does know. Speak with the reference.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:02):
Do you have a favorite question you like to ask references? Is there something that you find is really helpful to tell you? Give you honest insight?

Uri Levine (01:03:09):
For reference?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
Yeah.

Uri Levine (01:03:11):
That's really simple. Would you hire him? Or would you hire her, right? So essentially at the end of the day you want to nail it into yes or no.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:26):
Yeah. And hope that they're being honest. That's sometimes a challenge.

Uri Levine (01:03:31):
No, if they will tell me yes, then I would ask them, "Why didn't you?" Someone asked me for a reference on someone that I really enjoyed working with. I really think highly of them, and he asked me if they can schedule a call for half an hour and I said, "Look, I'm traveling. I don't really have time. But if you want an email in one word, take the guy." And then he was trying to outsmart and ask me back, "Can I have that in two words?" And I said, "Yeah, take the guy fast." When you know, you know. That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
I like that. That's what you want to be looking for. Okay. Amazing. So let's do one more chapter. The one I was going to pick, you choose what you're more excited about, is selling a company. Your last chapter exit. The one you were thinking about going to is talking to users. I imagine that's much more applicable to more people, so that's probably the better choice, but your choice.

Uri Levine (01:04:28):
Okay, then let's stick with understanding users. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, wrote the foreword to my book and he called it the Bible for entrepreneurs, and when I sent him the first chapter, he said, "Wow, I wish I had that When I started." I met Steve Wozniak for the first time about 10 years ago. We spoke at the same conference in Guatemala, and look, when I grew up, Steve Wozniak was my technological guru, right so he was the most important person in the technology space in my mind. And then we spoke at the same conference and we had dinner the night before, and the only thing that actually was really important for me is to have a selfie with my idol, right? And so I took up my iPhone and with the iPhone you can take pictures by clicking here on the screen or using the volume button on the side, right?

(01:05:34):
And so I took a selfie with him holding the phone like that and clicking on the volume button and he said, "Finally." And I said, "Finally what?" "Finally someone using it the way that I meant it to be." Now you realize that there is no right or wrong. There are different people that are using different products in different ways, and occasionally if I would have large audience, then I would ask the people, "Okay, how do you use Waze?" Right? "So you go to your destination and you enter destination, and then Waze guides you through the screen with the display of the maneuvers that needs to be made or with the audio guidance of turn right, turn left and so forth. If you are watching the screen, raise your hand." And then I would have about 70% of the people raise their hand." Then I ask people to watch around them and see those people. Then I ask, "If you are listening to the audio prompt, raise your hand." Then I have about 20 or 30 more percent of the people raising their hand. And again, I send people to watch around and see those hands.

(01:06:41):
There is no right or wrong. Different people are using it differently. Now, if you are using Waze in a certain way, up until this moment, you didn't know that there are other people that are using it differently, and to be frank, you don't care. You getting your own value the way that you get it, then you don't really care that there are other people that are getting it differently. But if you are building a product and you don't know that, then you are building the wrong product. You don't know that there are other people that are not like you, and you think that you're building the product for yourself, then you're making a big mistake. And the way to figure it out is, by the way, two things. Number one, watch new users. Simply watch users and see what they're doing. And number two, if they're not doing what you expect them to do, then ask them why, because this why is the one that is going to make your product successful. You understand the why and the next version you're going to address that.

(01:07:42):
Now, this is in particular when it comes to understanding users. Obviously there are a lot of users, but we can group them into several groups of their ability to adapt something new, and something new is not necessarily new technology. We think about it as a new technology, but it's not necessarily about technology. It's about new behavior, right? And then we look at the entire population and every time that we look into large numbers, they will have normal distribution, right? So the bell curve of the distribution, and then we will have about 2% of the populations that they're the innovatives. The innovatives are going to use something new because it's new. That's it. They care about this subject and they going to be the first one to hear about it and they're going to try that out because it's new. The second group is usually what we will get to see as the first users are the early adapters. As soon as they realize that there is value, they're going to give it a try. And if there is value, then they will keep on using it, and if there is no value, then they will quit. Right?

(01:08:55):
The third group is the most important group. This is where market leaders are, right? This is called the early majority. This is about one third of the population, and the one that wins the early majority wins the market. The challenge with this group, with the people in this group, is that they're afraid of change. So their state of mind is, don't rock the boat. Whatever I'm currently doing is good enough for me. So if you have Salesforce.com, which is absolutely amazing, their reaction is going to be, "What's wrong with Excel?" And because they're afraid of change, they are not going to try something new. Now the reason is that at the end of the day, they're afraid that this is going to be too complex for them and they will not get it, and they don't want to be embarrassed and they don't want to feel like idiots. And guess what? People don't like to feel like idiots, and so they are not going to try. And you need to see those people to understand their barriers for starting to use your service.

(01:10:02):
And by the way, the solution is always the same. Simplicity. Leonardo da Vinci said that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. If you want to make it simple, in your journey of building a product, we basically say this is iteration to iteration to iteration. In many of those you add features and you add features and you add features until you all of a sudden you add the features that people are using. What you really want to do next is remove the rest of the features that people are not using because they're adding complexity. Now, most of the product owners, they're either innovators or early adopters. You cannot understand an early majority person. If you belong to one group, you cannot understand a person from that group unless you watch them and [inaudible 01:10:57]. So the most important part of understanding users is actually seeing those users. And they are not wrong. This is how they behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):
So a couple of threads there I'll pull out. One is look for surprising uses of your product because, as you said, you'll realize, "Oh, some people are using this in a way that I didn't expect," and it'll remind you people are not the way you are and don't assume that they're going to want exactly what you're building, so pay attention to things that surprise you. We had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast and he talked through a lot of this stuff, and one of the lessons there to help you bridge that gap from, to the, what is it, the third group? How did you describe it? The late majority?

Uri Levine (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:42):
The early majority.

Uri Levine (01:11:44):
Late majority will never use the product. They will use your product only if they have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):
Yeah. The laggards, I think he calls it. They look for basically references. People telling them, "Hey, you really need to use this." A lot of people, just like basically word-of-mouth is the way you described it.

Uri Levine (01:11:58):
No, not just word-of-mouth. Even occasionally someone to show them how to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):
Yeah. That makes sense. Just like, "Here, check out Waze. Here's how it works." Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Amazing. Is there anything else along those lines as you're talking to customers and understanding what you're looking for that you want to share?

Uri Levine (01:12:17):
Occasionally what happens is that we speak with the wrong customers. So just imagine that we have what I call funnel of use, right? So on top of the funnel, we have people that are download the app, let's say, or have entered their website, and then the next phase is that they registered and the next phase that they're trying to use it for the first time and then the next phase is that they're getting the value and they're coming back, right? In this funnel, what we usually try to do is speak with the users at the bottom of the funnels, those that were successful. But in order to improve, we need to speak with those that fail, those that were unsuccessful, those that did not register, or they did register and did not use, or they did use and did not come back, because they know something that we really need to know. Why? This why is what makes a great product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):
Interesting. I imagine you could also fall into danger there if people that just aren't a fit for your product, there's just no point wasting your time on people that are just not going to be a fit. So is the idea there find people that are really far down the funnel but still bounced and churned?

Uri Levine (01:13:34):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
Awesome. Amazing. Okay. So we've gone through all the chapters I was hoping to go through, plus the ones you were excited about. Final thing before we get to our very exciting lightning round, we have a segment on this podcast called Fail Corner, where I ask a guest to share a time they failed in their career and what they learned from that experience, and I'm curious if there is a story that comes to mind of a time that you failed either in a startup or as you were an employee somewhere and how that was important to you.

Uri Levine (01:14:05):
So number one, I reserve the right for my biggest failure yet to come. And look, I keep on trying new things. I keep on doing things, and so eventually I will fail as much as... Maybe I'm more successful statistically than others, but I will fail, and this is very, very important part to realize. Don't be afraid to fail, right? In your journey, you're going to fail multiple times, and when you fail and get up, you get up stronger. This is maybe something that I will tell all the parents in the world. The biggest advice that I can give you is teach your children to fail. Because when they get up, they get up stronger, and when they know that they will get out of their comfort zone and they will eventually discover what makes them happy. At the end of the day, as parents, there's only one thing that we really like. We want our kids to be happy in their own way. We don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. We want them to explore, and they will only explore if they are not afraid to fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):
Yeah. This is a very timely advice for me because our kid is always falling down and it's always this balance between helping them not fall and letting them figure things out.

Uri Levine (01:15:27):
Let them fall. There is a Japanese saying, fall seven times and get up eight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Uri Levine (01:15:43):
No, I think that was actually, I really enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):
Amazing. Well, we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Uri Levine (01:15:50):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people other than your own book?

Uri Levine (01:15:58):
Mark Randolph of Netflix. That Will Never Work, right? And by the way, it's funny. Mark Randolph wrote endorsement to my book and I reached out to him because I read someplace that he's answering all of his emails, and I reached, I sent him an email and said, "Look, we have at least three things in common. Number one, I do answer all of my emails as well. Number two, I'm using your product, you are using mine. And number three, I heard more time that will never work than you did." And I think that understanding this journey is really, really important, so this is definitely a book that I would recommend. Atomic Habits. Getting habits and improving them, measuring and improving, is really, really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Very cool choices. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Uri Levine (01:17:02):
I don't watch a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Easy, then. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Uri Levine (01:17:11):
So I can bet that most of the people say the ChatGPT, but actually no. I recently downloaded the Chess App and I returned to play chess with the computer or something that I haven't done for so many years, and I really enjoy that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Amazing. It's actually, I don't think ChatGPT has ever been recommended. Recent choices have been a beautiful Persian rug, a Rivian, a very nice Mercedes, and I think recently it was a course on nervous system regulation.

Uri Levine (01:17:48):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:49):
All over the place. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find really useful in work, your own life? It may be the one on your shirt, but is there any other that you come back to often and find useful?

Uri Levine (01:18:03):
Don't be afraid to fail. I think that in many cases we need to accept the fact that we don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):
Important words. Final question, is there a problem you're starting to fall in love with more recently, maybe tinkering with a new startup idea? Or are you done with starting companies?

Uri Levine (01:18:21):
I probably will never be done. I have 10 different startups in multiple areas. One of them, Pontera helps people to retire richer, which is one of the biggest challenges in the world in general, but also in the U.S. If I would ask a hundred people on the street that have 401k plans, "What is your 401k plan invested at?" 95% of them will tell me, "I don't know." I do know, by the way. In the default. Whatever was the default when they joined, right? Now obviously if you didn't do anything and you think it's right, no, it's not right. It's probably simply not enough. So this is a big problem. I have one in the medical space that is trying to create, I would call that the AI of the medical knowledge, so trying to improve doctors, and in particular in clinical decisions. That is going to change the world.

(01:19:27):
But if you would ask me, then I will give you some examples, right? So mobility is still a problem, right? You look at many areas in our lifetime and mobility is still, every year it's, instead of getting better, it's getting lesser. So mobility is still a problem. And medical services, right? U.S. medical services are five to 10 times more expensive than they are in Germany. Now, it's not that they're better. They're simply more expensive. So obviously you ask yourself, "Okay, where is this inefficiency? Where is it?" Right? A lot of places of inefficiency in the medical services if they're so expensive. Education. Okay. Anything that I will tell you that we are still doing the same way that our parents did is probably something that we need to revisit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:22):
I feel like I nerd sniped you with falling in love with problems. Clearly fall in love with a lot of problems. You want to solve them all. You're addicted to startups.

Uri Levine (01:20:29):
The good news is that there are a lot of problems and the bad news that there are lots of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:34):
And you're there to solve it. I love it. Uri, your book is amazing. It's incredibly practical, full of tons of advice that every founder should read, and it goes from idea all the way to exit. So basically, no matter where you're on the journey, the book is going to be useful to you. Tell people where to find it and where they can follow you for more stuff that you share over time, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Uri Levine (01:20:56):
So obviously this is the book. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, basically places that you can find it. You can follow me on LinkedIn. This is pretty much the only network that I'm actually engaged. If you read the book, then you will find my email in the book and then you can email me, as well. And I do answer all of my emails. I want you to read the book. I don't want you to buy the book. I want you to read the book. And the reason is that I have a purpose in life and this is creating value, and I believe that this book is going to be the best return on investment that you ever made. Not the $20 or $30 that it costs, but the time that you're going to spend on reading it, and therefore, I can be valuable for you, and if I can be valuable for you, then I serve my purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):
Amazing. If you weren't on YouTube watching this, the book is called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, if you're trying to Google it and find that on Amazon. And Uri, thank you so much for being here.

# A founder’s guide to crisis management | Uri Levine (Waze co-founder, serial entrepreneur)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's talk about crisis. I think it might be helpful to do a quick taxonomy of the types of crisis founders face.

Uri Levine (00:00:05):
So two, abstractly, two types of crisis. One is I would call that a cash crisis. All of a sudden, your cash program or plan is being jeopardized, losing a customer, disappearing investor. And the other one is lose of product market fit. When product market fit disappear, you actually need to go back to square one. Then you basically say everything that I know so far is irrelevant anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
You also talk along these lines of never give up in a crisis and throughout your journey.

Uri Levine (00:00:35):
Always keep on looking for ways to make it work. Never give up is the most important behavior of successful CEOs of startup. The second one, by the way, is making decisions with conviction. If you don't make them with conviction, then the team is not going to follow. If the team is not going to follow, then you are not going to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
The core part of your advice on crisis, it's always the founders fault if things don't work out.

Uri Levine (00:00:57):
At the end of the day, you cannot rely on someone else, you have only one company, you need to make sure that this company is successful. When you assume responsibility, you're basically saying, "You know what, I control my own destiny."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Any advice for how to avoid falling into a crisis as a founder?

Uri Levine (00:01:14):
Number one answer is no, don't worry, you will face crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):
Today, my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze, along with nine other companies. He's sold two companies for over a billion dollars, he's been on 20 different startup boards, has been an advisor to over 50 different startups. And even more impressively, this is his second time on the podcast.

(00:01:39):
In our first conversation, we walked through the biggest lessons that he's learned over the course of working with all of these different startups that he chronicled in his beloved book, Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. In this conversation, we go deep on one very specific topic, crisis. As Uri shares in his book, building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next. And my goal with this conversation is to give you tools to handle the next crisis and the next crisis and the next crisis that you face as a founder. This topic is so important that Uri decided to update and re-release his book with a whole new chapter dedicated to managing crisis. And this new edition is actually going to launch right around the time this episode launches.

(00:02:17):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Uri Levine.

(00:02:30):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.

(00:02:53):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

(00:03:24):
If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:03:49):
This episode is brought to you by Rippling, a single platform to build and scale your startup on. Rippling handles all the can't get it wrong admin work of payroll and benefits, giving you back hours every week. But it does a lot more than that. Rippling is a game changer for the entire company with tools for HR, IT and spend all built from the ground up and designed to work together seamlessly.

(00:04:13):
Just hired someone, Rippling makes onboarding easy whether your new hire is sitting next to you or halfway across the world. In just a few clicks, Rippling automatically generates an offer letter, ships a laptop with the necessary apps and permissions and even delivers a corporate card. An employee needs to update their benefits contribution, when they do it in Rippling, the change automatically syncs to payroll. CTO forgot her laptop in an Uber, lock it remotely with Rippling.

(00:04:38):
Many startups I've invested in like Sprig, Ellamy and ClassDojo use Rippling because it's a force multiplier for lean teams, helping them eliminate major headaches and operate their business more efficiently. For a limited time, Rippling is giving Lenny's listeners three months off. To redeem, visit rippling.com/lenny. That's rippling.com/lenny.

(00:05:03):
Uri, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Uri Levine (00:05:06):
Thank you. I'm really happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:08):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast, this is your second time here, which is a pretty rare feat. And the reason that you're back is, the first time we chatted in depth about your amazing book. I have it right here, Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. And you decided to re-release the book recently with a new chapter about something that every single founder is going to go through. You actually have this quote I'll read that I think is a good summary of why this is so important. "That building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next." Let me just start with this question of why did you decide to add this chapter, why is it so important to update your book?

Uri Levine (00:05:43):
End of the day, recent years have demonstrated major significant crisises throughout the world, from Covid to interest rate, to inflation, to wars. And then I realized that wait a minute, this is something that I haven't spoke about during my first book and it's time to write a new edition to that or a new chapter that will be added into the new release. And so this is about crisis. And in addition, my publisher told me that, "Oh, you should have a paperback, it's going to sell more and more people are going to read it because it's easier to read." So I do have the new edition already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:25):
There is?

Uri Levine (00:06:26):
It will be published in about a month and it does include a new chapter. And it's a paperback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:34):
I love that you're solving the jobs to be done, make it easier to read, we'll make it paperback. I also, as you described it, it made me realize the reason your book is so great is it's basically a step-by-step guide of all the things you need to know about building a successful company. And what it feels like is you just realize, oh, I forgot this step that every founder goes through, which is crisis.

Uri Levine (00:06:54):
Multiple crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:55):
Multiple crisis, we'll get into that. Also, I love that you can actually update a book. Usually people are like, "Oh, books, done." You move on. I love that you have the opportunity actually to update a book. That's inspiring.

Uri Levine (00:07:08):
I'm already thinking of the next one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:11):
The next book or the next update to the book?

Uri Levine (00:07:15):
Not sure yet, not sure. Look, at the end of the day, there is a reason for me to write the book. I wrote the book in order to make a bigger impact. I'm an entrepreneur and everyone knows that, so I built Waze and Moovit and dozens of other startups, but I'm also a teacher. So I feel equally rewarded when I build something myself or I guide someone to build it. And the book is fulfilling my destiny as a teacher, sharing my know-how with entrepreneurs, with business people, with pretty much everyone to help them to become more successful.

(00:07:50):
So the realization that what I really want is people to take out of the book is something that will increase their likelihood of being successful. And the next book is going to be pretty much the same, with the same philosophy of wait a minute, if I can make a bigger impact, I would like to make a bigger impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:13):
It's a beautiful mission. I think we're going to do that. Let's talk about crisis. Maybe to make this very real and visceral for people to get a sense of, you hear the word crisis, you're like, oh yeah, sure. Can you maybe share a story of a crisis that you experienced that might be illustrative of the types of crisis that founders face across the many companies you've started and advised, what comes to mind?

Uri Levine (00:08:34):
Covid was an excellent example. And one of my startups back then, called Order.chat, and actually it was the first AI chat back in 2020. And that was meant to help people to make reservations to restaurants. As simple as, "Oh, I would like to make a reservations for six people for tomorrow night at XYZ restaurant." And that chat was actually very, very successful in Israel. And the reason is that we actually built an engine that had facing the user with a chat but also facing the restaurant with a chat. So we did not require any integration, we could go online anywhere and actually cover all the restaurants in no time. And that turned out to be pretty successful and then Covid hit. And guess what? All the restaurants were shut down for hosting guests and there were no more reservations for restaurants.

(00:09:41):
Now we were really good at that, but we did not have enough funding to actually pivot into something completely different. And the result is that we had to shut it down. And still people still ask me what happened to that? What happened to that was Covid.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
I feel like Covid happened to a lot of companies. And it feels like that's kind of an impetus to this chapter. I think you even said that, it created so many crisis across so many companies you were involved with, helped you realize a lot of companies and founders are just not prepared.

Uri Levine (00:10:13):
So by and large I would say end of the day, we look at the global crisises and we say, "Oh, this is going to impact an industry." But as an entrepreneur, you don't care about the industry, you care about your own startup, that's it. And if the rest of the world is suffering from the same problem, doesn't help you, not even a single bit. So your problem is your problem, that's it.

(00:10:39):
And then you need to abstract that and basically realize, okay, wait a minute, I will define a crisis as something that you already had that is significant, disappears. So let's say that you already have millions of dollars in revenues and all of a sudden your biggest customer decide not to continue and you lose half of your revenues. All of a sudden you basically say, "Wait a minute, I have to adapt, something significant happened."

(00:11:10):
And that something significant is that your revenues disappear or maybe your funding disappeared or maybe ... So in general, the first type of crisis will be around cash. All of a sudden your cash is not the same as you expected, something happened, maybe funding, maybe revenues, maybe projection, maybe you lost a big customers, a cash crisis. And then you need to adapt.

(00:11:43):
The second one, which is even more significant, is that you lost product market fit. And that might happen, it might happen because of regulations, because of competition, because of something dramatic happened that there is no more value into your product. And we are going back to basic, product market fit is very simple. That means that you create value to your customers, this is what it is. And you never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died, that's it.

(00:12:20):
And by the way, product market fit in general have only one metric, only one metric, retention. Look, it's really simple, if you create value, they will come back, that's it. If they are not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. And so in your startup journey, this is going to be the first phase, and it's going to require a lot of iterations and it's a journey of failures. So we're going to try something and it doesn't work, we're going to try something else. And we keep on trying until we find one thing that does work.

(00:12:54):
But once you figure that out, you're ready to move to the next part of your journey. But what if it's all disappeared? What if all of a sudden someone changed their regulation? Someone you rely on, a very unique data, that you were able to build and all of a sudden someone create a way to access this data for everyone. What if there is a competitor that makes you irrelevant?

(00:13:22):
I'm using iPhone, obviously a lot of people using iPhone and I'm using that for a long while. iPhone is born in 2007. Before that we used to have different phones with keypads. And when iPhone was introduced, Microsoft basically say this will never work. They were in a position of a market leader, they own Windows mobile operating system that was running on pretty much all the phones in the world. All the smartphones in the world, from Nokia to Motorola, to Samsung, to pretty much everything. And they look at it and say this will never work. They haven't realized how impactful it is. So this is a competition coming out to the market with something that is completely different. And not only disrupt the market but actually create crisis for pretty much everyone else.

(00:14:15):
And the result is that today Microsoft is not a player in the mobile operating system and Nokia disappeared or pretty much disappeared and Motorola disappeared and pretty much everyone that was really significant in this industry, they were not adapted fast enough to the change. And the change was that their product market fit disappeared. Now it's not that their product all of a sudden become irrelevant, people simply wanted something else.

(00:14:48):
So when product market fit disappeared, you actually need to go back to square one. And the faster that you realize and you basically say everything that I know so far, everything that I knew so far is irrelevant anymore. Can I restart? Can I go back to square one and restart? Because if you cannot, you will die. You're following your own solution and you believe that this solution is going to be marketed better than what the market wants. And what the market wants is different.

(00:15:25):
It can be also a matter of regulation change. One of my startups called Fibo died because of change in regulation. So Fibo was doing tax returns, something that everyone hates, but we have to do that. And when we started we basically say wait a minute, when I speak with people and ask them how is tax returns being done in your country, what I heard was pretty consistent, it's either complex or expensive or both, that's it. And I said wait a minute, what if I can simplify that? What if we can make it really, really simple?

(00:16:08):
And we define simplification by filing in less than five minutes. Whatever you do, if you can do that in less than five minutes, it's simple enough. And we ended up with building a platform in Israel that people were able to file in less than three minutes. And that was actually pretty amazing. Now the result was that in about ... In Israel filing is not mandatory. So we actually enable people that were not filing up until now to file because it's simple. And we increased the size of the market by 25% over one year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:42):
Of people filing taxes?

Uri Levine (00:16:43):
Yep. Because it was simple. So you go into the platform, you realize that wait a minute, I actually entitled to get a return, so let me file. If I'm not entitled to get a return, then I'm not going to file because it's not mandatory. And the result is that we increased the load of the taxation system. And all of a sudden the Israeli tax authority didn't like us anymore and they basically shut us down. So changing the regulation and we lost product market fit overnight. They basically say, "Oh, we are going to shut you down and that's tomorrow." And that's it.

(00:17:22):
Now we did not have enough run rate to actually ... because the company was about break even, so we did not have enough funding to go and try to find something else. And we tried to fight the regulator, but fighting regulator requires a long period of time and a lot of funding and we did not have that.

(00:17:49):
So regulation might be a reason why you lose product market fit. And you need to go back to square one. And what we decided is that, okay, what I decided on a personal level is that I'm not going deal with the regulation anymore. I don't want to rely on a regulator to allow me or not allow me to do what I want to do.

(00:18:16):
By the way, with Waze, in the early days we thought that the business model is going to be selling data to authorities, to municipalities, to maybe public transportation systems and so forth. And we basically say wait a minute, we have the best traffic information in the world, I can go to a municipality and tell them how long does it take to make a left turn in each and every traffic light in the city every day of the week, every hour of the day. And therefore they can recalibrate the traffic control system and enable better utilization of the entire road system. And it turns out that this is really, really, really slow business development process. They didn't really care. And that was frustrating. Even if you offer that for free they still don't care. And the result is that we changed the business model and we ended up with advertisement. But the reality is that I don't like to work with regulators, that is all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):
Okay. There's so much here I want to dig into. One is this example, this story about losing product market fit, it reminds me of, I had Drew Houston on the podcast, the founder of Dropbox, and he described a moment where when Apple launched Apple Photos or iCloud, I think it was iCloud, he's like, "It's as if there's this mushroom cloud exploding far in the distance that you don't hear for a long time and we didn't necessarily see exactly how much this will have impacted our business." And I think that's what happens a lot of cases. You see something happen and you're like, "No, this is no problem, we're going to win anyway." Like Blackberry I think did the same thing with iPhone.

Uri Levine (00:20:01):
We had the same thing with Waze, because when we started Waze was free and it was the only one that was offering turn-by-turn navigation free. And the reason is that we created our own maps. And then one day in 2010, Google announced their free turn-by-turn navigation. Turns out that they were working for the last two years in building maps of the US. And they enabled that on Google Maps, turn-by-turn navigation with audio guidance to turn right, turn left and so forth.

(00:20:38):
And two companies were actually shocked, the entire industry, but two companies were impacted. The first one is actually TomTom. TomTom was the provider of the maps for Google to do navigation. And they basically say, "No, we have our own maps, we are going to terminate the contract." And TomTom said, "Wait a minute, you are paying us $18 million a year and we have five years contract." And Google say, "Yeah, we will keep on paying you that amount of money that we are committed, but we are not going to use your product anymore."

(00:21:11):
And that one was Waze because basically everyone in the industry told us that we are doomed. Our own investors told us that, "Look, if we can sell the company for $20 or $30 million today, do it because you are not going to be successful."

(00:21:27):
Now obviously we turned the corner and turned out to be very successful. And to that level that eventually Google acquired us. And the reason is that the use case was different. Waze was focusing on the daily commuters. So we wanted people to use our application twice a day, when you go to the office and when you come back home. And Google Maps is something that you are being used not that frequent, you are in general I would say if I ask a hundred people how often they use Waze, they will tell me every day. If I ask them how often they use Google Maps, they will tell me, "When I need it." So a different use case and obviously different product that is built for the specificity of the use case. So Waze is way simpler and the map looks almost abstractive, they're not, but looks like abstractive and way less details. And the result is the ability to create something that is simpler and people are using every day.

(00:22:34):
But when Google announced turn-by-turn navigation, all the investors in the world turn their back on us. And that was 2010. We were looking for new funding. I remember that night, because we were just about to go and meet with all partners meeting at Khosla Ventures. And we had multiple meetings beforehand and that was like, okay, this is the final seal.

(00:23:07):
And the evening before we had dinner with the partners that was promoting us at Khosla Ventures and he told us, "Look, I have a lot of relationship in the industry, and I spoke with my friends at Google and they told me that they are at least two years away from building their own maps." And the next morning they simply announced this turn-by-turn navigation. Going to that meeting was a waste of time already. And we had very, very hard time to raise capital because of that.

(00:23:38):
But eventually we were lucky in the sense that once Google announced their turn-by-turn navigation, turns out that the rest of the industry were took by surprise. And Microsoft decided that wait a minute, we don't have our own maps, so let's invest in Waze. So we ended up getting investment from someone that we did not expect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):
Okay. So first of all, you've shared all these types of crisis, I think it might be helpful to do a quick taxonomy of the types of crisis founders face. You shared regulation changes, competitors coming at you, investors not wanting to invest.

Uri Levine (00:24:14):
So two types of, abstractly, two types of crisis. One is that I would call that a cash crisis. So all of a sudden your cash program or plan is being jeopardized, for losing a customer, disappearing investor, not meeting your expectation, dramatic price change in the market and so forth. And the other one is lose of product market fit. So all of a sudden whatever you have is irrelevant anymore and you actually need to go back to square one.

(00:24:54):
For the first type of crisis, if this is a cash crisis, then what you really need to ask yourself, and in any type crisis, first of all is what is actually being impacted? Is that my run rate, is that my product, is that my revenue stream? If I'm still relevant?

(00:25:19):
With Order.chat, we were irrelevant, that's it. And so the first thing that you need to do is what is really being impacted? And then the second thing is how long it's going to last? Is that a temporary thing? Is that forever? Is that the new future? And then you ask yourself, okay, so how much run rate do I have? And you re-plan accordingly.

(00:25:52):
And I'll give you some examples, and this is really important, because let's say that you're a company that we have $5 million of revenues a year, say 400,000 per month, and your burn rate, your net burn rate is 200,000. So you actually at the end of the year, in order to run for a year, you need about two and a half million dollars to run. If you lose half of the revenues, and you only had two and a half million in the bank, you now have six month to run. So obviously you need to re-adapt.

(00:26:36):
Now, one of the things that you might say to yourself, "I'm going to remain on the same course and I'm going to deal with the crisis in five month from now." Or you can basically say, "No, I'm going to change my expense to adjust to the current revenue stream that I have and still have 12 month of run rate."

(00:26:58):
Whatever you are going to decide, you are going to decide, you need to decide today, right now. And the reason is very simple, if you want to reduce the burn, the expenses in order to extend the run rate, if you wait two more month, then it's going to become nearly impossible to do. If you wait six more month, then obviously this is impossible to do. So the longer that you wait, you actually lose options. The only ability to choose is today. This is one of the most challenging part of a crisis. You actually need to make a decision rapidly, like today.

(00:27:41):
There are few reasons to that. Number one is that if you don't then you might lose options. Number two, and this is about communicating within the organization that decision. Look, if there is a crisis everyone knows, everyone knows, and you don't do anything about it, this is not a good practice. Now you might want to decide, no, we're going to keep on running full steam ahead until we hit the wall because by that we increase the likelihood that we will have enough velocity to bypass the wall. But you need to communicate that with your team because the one that is really suffer is not just you, it's the entire team. They know that there is a crisis and they want to know that someone that holds the steering wheel is making the decisions. And if you don't, then guess what? You are then a sinking ship. And what's going to happen is that the top performing people, they would leave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:46):
Let me do a quick summary of what you've shared to give people a landscape and then let's keep going down this route. So there's basically two types of crisis. And there's small crisis, I imagine someone's pissed off at something. These are how you describe major crisis, like existential crisis for your startup. Is that the way to think about it?

Uri Levine (00:29:04):
Right. Because if an A-player leaves, I hate it, but it's not a crisis.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:10):
Yeah. Okay, cool. So there's two, cash crisis, which is either a bunch of revenue disappears or investors bail or don't want to keep supporting you. Those are the two major buckets. And then there's product market fit crisis, could be a competitor launches, could be the market changes, things like that.

(00:29:28):
And within the cash crisis, so say you realize we don't have as much cash as we planned or need, the three steps you just described, what is really being impacted? Just be really real with what is the impact to our business with this change. How long do we think this cash crisis will last? And how long do we have before we run out of cash essentially?

Uri Levine (00:29:51):
Yep. And then you need to decide, and then you need to decide on your action and your new plan and maybe it's a new strategy. If all of a sudden I would say if this is about product market fit disappeared, then this is a new strategy. And maybe it's about deciding on extending the run rate or keep on trying or whatever. And this is something that is really interesting.

(00:30:17):
And we go back to Covid and I look at two of my startups that were in the travel space, one of them is WeSki, and it's essentially the booking.com of ski vacations. And guess what? Covid started. And there was no more ski trips to Europe. Europe were shut down completely. And all the ski areas were shut down. And you know that I'm an avid skier? For me that was a disaster on a personal level. And eventually by the way, what happened is that I was back in Tel Aviv and I was unable to travel to Europe, and it was only somewhere in 2022 that I was able to travel to the US after vaccination and so forth. And in March, 2022, I actually moved myself to Utah to Salt Lake City and I basically say, "No, I'm going to ski every day that I'm not busy." And I skied until the end of the season.

(00:31:22):
So what happened is that Covid started and we realized that we have major problem. And the problem was actually, the first thing that you face is cancellation because all of a sudden out of very few cancellations per day, you ended up with hundreds of cancellations per day because this is it. And after you dealt with that, then the next question that we ask ourselves, okay, so how bad is it, how long it's going to last?

(00:31:54):
Now that was supposed to be the first year that we were profitable. So we did not have a lot of cash in the bank because we expected to become profitable this year. And we basically told our ourself, okay, this season is over, next season is not going to happen. We don't know, but we need to plan for something that is going to last longer than that. And then we basically say, okay, how can we deal with it?

(00:32:21):
Now, because of WeSki had a lot of strategic investors from the travel industry, in the travel industry, they didn't really care about WeSki, they care about their own product. If you are a hotel chain, then guess what? You have no travelers. If you're an airline, guess what? You have no flyers. So anyone in the travel industry suffered from the same problem. And the last thing on earth that they care about is a startup that they invested at. And we realized that, okay, wait a minute, we don't have enough cash to survive for two seasons without revenues, we need to raise additional capital.

(00:33:00):
Now, no one, no new investor is going to speak with us, because there's no ski, so what are you talking about? And we approached the existing investor, and by the way I'm one of them, and we basically say, "Okay, you know what? We need your help." And everyone told us, "Oh, we are busy. We have other problems to deal with. We have our own problems. I don't see how is that going to become a good investment and so forth." And then we basically decided that, okay, wait a minute, we're going to do a pay to play.

(00:33:37):
The pay to play is actually sort of forcing new investors at the expense of the existing one. So for example, doing a major down round is sort of pay to play, because if you're not participate your position in the company is going to be diluted severely. And this is what we decided to do. And that was way more complex, I describe that in the book, way more complex than that because we also had safe instruments that we need to convert before we can actually do something like that. And that was really complex. But we ended up doing that. And today the company is actually very successful.

(00:34:20):
After Covid, we used the time of Covid to actually improve the product, and as soon as Covid was over then we started to grow rapidly. And the company is profitable, is growing rapidly, is actually providing very, very good service to its customers. To a certain extent I would say we ended up getting out of this crisis successfully.

(00:34:49):
But if you are in the middle of it and you ask yourself, so what are the chances that we will end up being successful? It looks way smaller. Way smaller. So what happened here is that you realize that, okay, this is not forever, so ski is going to come back but we don't know how long and therefore we assume that it's going to be for two seasons until it's coming back, until 2022. And for that we need to adapt. And so we resized the company to be very, very lean and small and we raise just enough capital to survive those two years. And it ended up to be working very well. But in that sense now, if you would ask me how much luck was in there, luck is always good.

(00:35:43):
I think that I heard ... maybe the most significant real estate developers in New York is Silverstein, and he built the World Trade Center and pretty much everything on the Hudson. And he was asked how he becomes such a successful developer and he said, "Tell you the truth, this is 85% luck and 15% skills and know-how and so forth." And then he was asked if he can change one thing, what exactly it's going to be, and he said, "You know what? I'm going to replace the 15% skills with additional 15% luck." So luck is good. For me luck, I will define luck as opportunity meets readiness. Readiness is up to you; opportunity, not always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):
Beautifully said. I also agree with luck being so core to most people's success, most company's success. But I feel like you're not giving people enough credit for the hard work that's also involved in the skills and timing and stuff.

Uri Levine (00:36:47):
On the readiness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:47):
That's the readiness.

Uri Levine (00:36:49):
Of being ready to take advantage of opportunity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
That makes sense. Okay, there's a bunch of stuff I want to dig into here. So one is, and this is something, it's kind of a tangent, but I think it's a core part of your advice on crisis, which is that it's always the founder's fault if things don't work out, even if they're completely out of your control, even if the whole world is changing, it's still your responsibility and your fault if things don't work out.

Uri Levine (00:37:18):
I wouldn't say fault, I would say responsibility.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:21):
Responsibility.

Uri Levine (00:37:25):
It might not end up beautiful, in some cases you will die. But at the end of the day you cannot rely on someone else. The fact that the interest rate is going up and the result is that it's becoming very, very hard to raise capital, the fact that this is industry-wide, so what? You have only one company, you need to make sure that this company is successful. And later on if you fail, then you can rely to then basically say, "This is my excuse, it was not just me." Not just me is not going to help you to become successful. Just me is going to help you to become successful. When you assume responsibility, then you are able to ... you're basically saying, "You know what? I control my own destiny. I'm going to make the decisions and I control my own destiny." When this happens, you increase the likelihood of being successful regardless what happen to the rest of the market, and you don't really care.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:31):
You also talk along these lines, you have this in your chapter, the section of never give up in a crisis and throughout your journey, this is by far the most important behavior of a startup CEO. Can you just talk about that. Because a lot of times it's like maybe just stop, maybe just give up. You shared one example where it's like I don't want to deal with regulation, other companies, I'm just going to stop. Any advice there, just like, okay, maybe it does make sense just to stop and try to give the investor's money back versus, yeah, it's just part of your job not to give up.

Uri Levine (00:38:58):
I heard of cases that you basically say our underlining assumptions didn't work out and our thesis is wrong and therefore we would like to return the investors their money. But entrepreneurs never give up. And this is the most successful behavior of startup CEO, never give up, always keep on looking for ways to make it work. And so it is going to be a journey of failures, and in particular during crisis, but you still need to keep on trying to make it work even though it's way harder. So never give up is the most important behavior of successful CEO of startup.

(00:39:41):
The second one, by the way, is making decisions with conviction. This is true for all CEOs or for all companies, not just startups. Now startups, those decisions are probably more frequent and there are a lot of them. But during crisis, all CEOs in the world need to make hard decisions. And you need to make them with conviction because if you don't make them with conviction, then what will happen is that the team is not going to follow. If the team is not going to follow, then you are not going to be successful.

(00:40:14):
But never give up. You ask entrepreneurs what will happen and they will basically tell you, "No, we keep on fighting." One of my other startups in the travel industry called Oversee, back then they called FairFly. And the CEO told me that a cat might have nine souls. We are a cat in that sense, we have nine souls. And the reason that I know that is that we already died nine times or almost died nine times. And so the reality is that you don't give up, you keep on as long as ...

(00:40:56):
And for a second I would say, look, there are only two reasons that you would like to give up. One is that your mission is wrong. So the problem disappears. And if the problem disappears, your mission is no longer relevant or no longer valid, and you might want to consider to give up.

(00:41:19):
The other one is that if the team is not right and you are unable to change it. So you brought toxic investors into the board and they started to control the company and obviously in many cases they create more damage than help. And you're unable to change that anymore, then this is a good reason to give up.

(00:41:43):
Other than that, never give up. Crisis, not crisis, hardship, no money to pay, no ... anything that might happen, anything that you might want to think that might happen will happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:06):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:08):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:23):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. And not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:42:57):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:16):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:43:30):
This idea of never give up, it's very similar to Dalton Caldwell was on the podcast, he's a partner at YC, and his whole ... he has a famous talk, I guess, at YC, and this was the title of this podcast episode, is just don't die. That's his main advice to a startup, just don't die.

Uri Levine (00:43:45):
Never give up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:45):
Never give up.

Uri Levine (00:43:46):
You might die by the way, you might die, you'll never give up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:50):
Then be reborn. And to be clear, the way a startup dies is they run out of money, is that the simplest way to think about that?

Uri Levine (00:43:57):
That's the only way that they die. By the way, all the companies in the world, they are unable to pay their bills and therefore they die.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:06):
And many of the tactics you share is just ways to not run out of money. Oftentimes it involves down rounds, creating strange cap structures just to keep it alive, losing equity percentage just to keep it going, that's part of the job basically, and that's what you have to deal with.

Uri Levine (00:44:24):
In many cases, we had to engage the employees, "No, we don't have cash." So what we did is that we diluted all shareholders in order to give employees way more equity. So five times more equity than they had before. And we told them, we need you to trust us and believe in the cause and believe in our ability to recover. And if we don't, then everyone loses. But if we do, then everyone wins big time. And so this will be a way to actually reengage employees if you are unable to pay them their regular pay. And that was the case in most of the startups that almost run out of cash.

(00:45:08):
Occasionally you can do, if you will tell me that you're going to run out of cash next month and therefore you need to shut down, I would like to imagine that you have at least six more month of run rate. You don't know that, but this is through leadership. So you basically tell your people, "Stay with me, you believed in the cause, you believed in my leadership, I still believe in the cause and I still believe in you. And maybe we are going to have some hard time, maybe we are going to have some month that unable to pay, but eventually we will get out of that." And in many cases, most people will stay.

(00:45:55):
Now, leadership, you don't build leadership during crisis, you might, but in particular you build leadership through transparency, through recognitions of your team, through actually putting your team as the top priority. At the end of the day, you are going to be successful if your team delivers. And in order for the team to deliver, then they need you to trust them to deliver.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):
This is really powerful advice and I want to spend a little more time here, which is keeping people on board and engaged and motivated through a crisis. So this kind of almost script you just shared is really great. Is there anything else that you found useful or any advice you could share for helping a founder keep the team on board, keep people excited, driven? These words you shared I think is a really good example, is there anything else?

Uri Levine (00:46:53):
So during crisis, people will appreciate more than anything else transparency. And if you hide information from them, then they would leave, they don't trust you anymore. But if there is a crisis, and look, if there is a crisis then everyone knows that there is a crisis, it's not surprising for anyone. And this is where they expect your leadership the most. This is where they expect you to be there for them. And tell them that this is what we're going to do. And if ABC happens, then we will be successful. And if it's not, then we will die. And I want you to believe that we can deliver A, B and C, and I want you to stay here for that part of the journey. And this is really, really dramatic, this is perhaps the most important part. Look, during crisis, the team is the one that is going to take you out of the crisis, and you need them more than ever. And guess what? They need you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):
When you talk about being transparent and open about everything, what's an example of just how far you recommend people go? Because you could just be like, here's all of our data and metrics and numbers, here's what our investors are emailing me. How real do you recommend people get? I know it's hard to just summarize in a couple sentences, but what's a good way to illustrate that?

Uri Levine (00:48:19):
So number one, don't sugarcoat. So you basically you don't need to share all the feedbacks from all the investors. You can tell them, "Look, I met dozens of investors in the last couple of weeks and they're all saying no." Or we had a signed term sheet and the investor disappeared. Okay, that's fine. It is what it is. Look, the fact that it's ugly, if you don't tell that it's ugly, it's still ugly.

(00:48:49):
And so I would share the essence. And if we have metrics, then what I would like to do is believe that everyone is aware of the metrics, of the key metrics of the company. This is something that in general I would say, "Oh, in the lobby of the office, we should have the key metrics displayed for everyone to understand this is what we stand for, this is how well we are executing anyhow." And so when they will see the numbers drop, they know that the numbers drop. And this is something that I will in general I would say, look, key metrics, they should be shared anyhow. And so in particular during crisis, we should keep on sharing them. Definitely not hiding information. So if you have a major customer leave or investor disappear or we are unable to sign a term sheet. And so this is the highlight, this is the major issue. And the details themselves, it's less critical. Now if people ask, then answer. If someone ask, "Okay, so how many investors have you met?" I'd say no, then start counting, 37, be specific.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:11):
That's a great answer. I want to come back to something you said that I think is so important but so hard, which is to act fast. If I was a founder, something changes in the market, it's easy to say, "Okay, you need to cut burn, you need go raise money, down round." It's so hard to do, to lay people off, to do all these challenging things for your company. Can you again just help people understand why it's so important to act fast? You talked about optionality goes away. Just like what actually happens there if you don't?

Uri Levine (00:50:42):
So I'll give you an example. So let's say that you are almost run out of cash and you believe that you're going to raise capital in the next two month. And if not, then you run out of cash. One of the things that you might want to do is extend the run rate. One other thing that you might want to do is actually tell the people that we will be running out of cash in two month. And number one, I want you to help me even if we run out of cash because there are good chances that we eventually will be able to raise capital and recover that. And number two, in order to get your support and belief in the company I am going to offer you more equity. So, the more equity is something that I will do twice, once today, once you realize that this is going to be challenging, and then again if we need to ask people to reduce their salary or do something dramatic around that.

(00:51:59):
And the first one is actually preventive action. So you share the know-how, you share the challenges that we are going to face. And you demonstrate generosity not out of you have to, but you demonstrate that. And then you essentially dramatically increase their loyalty and their commitment. And when you will need them, they will be there. So this is one example.

(00:52:35):
The other example is about calculating end of cash. And this is really, really important. So let's say that you have run rate of X month, six month. If you reduce burn by 50% today, then you simply increase your run rate to a year. If you don't do it today and you wait three more month, then you only can do that for the ... so the first three month you burn the same way that you did up until now, and now you reduce that to half, so you have six more month, total of nine month. If you decided today that you need 12 month, and you don't act today, you will never have 12 month.

(00:53:32):
Now, is that the only way to do that? No, it's not the only way, but it's one of the ways that by the way most companies will do. So they will reduce burn rate today in order to extend the run rate. Is that going to be more helpful? Don't know. Really depending on the case.

(00:53:53):
If you had asked me if you reduce the burn rate, increase the run rate, so now you have 12 month to raise new capital, is that going to have higher likelihood of remaining with the current plan and growth and raise capital within six month? I don't know that. But this is exactly the decision that you need to make.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:17):
That's a really great way of putting it. Just the math means the leverage you have now to extend runway is so much higher the sooner you make the decision. And the key, just going back to your algorithm of deciding if we need to act in this way quickly, is first think about what's being impacted, then how long is this impact going to last, and then how long do I have before you run out of money. And those questions is your advice for deciding, do we let people go now, do we raise money now.

Uri Levine (00:54:51):
There is always, by the way, there is always alternative for let people go. In general, I would say letting people go is probably better than reducing salary for everyone. But let's say that you need cost reduction of 30%. One of the options is let 30% of the people go. Another option is actually reduce salary by 30% for everyone. And it's going to have the same impact. Not exactly, the same impact on the balance sheet and on the P&L, but not necessarily on the organization. If the organization feels that they are committed to each other, they will prefer the second way. If this is more of individuals, then obviously they will prefer the first way.

(00:55:45):
Is there a different way? What about if management gives up on their salary? That might make the same impact. And definitely demonstration of leadership. And by the way, increasing the commitment of the rest of the organization.

(00:56:06):
So in that sense, I would say there are multiple ways of reducing the cost. But in general, this is always about impacting people. If you look at the startup and you look at the budget, 70% of the budget is people, maybe 75% of the budget is people. Everything else is nickels and dimes. If you're going to tell me, "Oh no, we are going to start the supply of coffee to the office and this is how we are going to reduce cost." No, this is how you create dissatisfaction with the team and you would reduce costs because some people would leave because of that, not because of lack of coffee, but because of inability to determine and to make hard decisions. So end of the day, if you need to reduce costs that means people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:58):
That was really good advice and really good set of options to consider versus laying people off. So most of what we've been talking about right now has been the cash crisis route. We've spent a little time on the product market fit crisis route. But I want to spend a little more time there. So for the cash crisis route, you have these kind of three questions and then it's like, cool, this will tell you how quickly to act and how severely to make cuts. In the product market fit route, is it essentially if you've lost product market fit, it's to pivot, is that basically the question? And then it's a question of where to pivot and what to do?

Uri Levine (00:57:32):
So the first question is, am I still relevant? And probably the answer is no. And then the next question that you basically say, "Okay, do I want to pivot?" And for that I will say, "If I would start today, is this is what I'm going to do?" And if the answer is yes, then do it.

(00:57:54):
Now in many cases you say, "Oh, wait a minute, I already have the organization and I already have money in the bank and this is what I'm going to do instead." I wouldn't necessarily do that. The way that I would look at it is different. Because the other alternative is basically say, "Wait a minute, all of my underlining assumptions have gone, they are wrong." I lost product market fit. The value proposition that I had is wrong or is no longer valid or no longer relevant. And therefore I need to start from scratch. Do I really have the assets to become successful on the new path?

(00:58:44):
And the assets could be technology that you already developed, could be the team that you already built, could be the know-how that you have in that specific market that gives you a significant advantage. And if any of those is really, really significant, then it's possible that you want to pivot. Pivot basically say major fuck up, all of our underlining assumptions have gone.

(00:59:13):
And because everything else, if it's not, then that's part of the journey of failure. If you'll tell me, "Oh, we tried this product or we tried this feature and didn't work," then this journey of fail. This is going to be your journey.

(00:59:27):
But once you figure out product market fit, if it disappears, then pivot is one option, shutting down is another option. And for shutting down, there are two things that you need to ask yourself. Do I have the energy to keep on going? Maybe you basically say, "I spent the last seven years trying to do that and now it's gone and you know what? I need some time off."

(00:59:53):
And the other one is that do I really have the assets to become dramatically successful? Pontera is one of my startups that I started back in 2012. And back then we called that FeeX. And we were dealing with financial fees in Israel and we were actually pretty successful. And then we decided, okay, wait a minute, Israel is a small market, let's move to the US. And we moved to the US. And one day the CEO came to me and said, "Look, we need to focus, I cannot do both, so we need to pivot." And we stopped the Israeli operation completely in order to focus all of our effort on the US operation. And then we realized that the nature of the beast is different and therefore we need to re-look for product market fit. And eventually we found that with the regulations of the Obama administration, and that was our product back in 2016 or 17.

(01:00:59):
And then the administration have changed and now it's going to change again. And they changed the regulation. And overnight we figured out that ... And we were actually on being a successful path. And we had to reinvent ourself. Now, what we basically said is, "Look, we have the energy to keep on going, we have something, a thesis that we believe might be relevant for us. We have the technology that can serve the thesis and we have enough cash to try it out." And we went back to the board and we offered them two options. Number one, we give you your money back. And number two, this is what we're going to try.

(01:01:43):
And the interesting part is that investors don't want their money back. They did not invest in order to have their money back, they invest in order to make a significant impact. And obviously they don't want to go back to their investors and tell them, guess what? And so we had all the support to keep trying something else. And since 2018, we are actually being pretty successful on this path. And all of a sudden, company is 12 years old, and we pivoted twice. And now we are end of the day helping Americans to retire richer. Helping financial advisors to support you on your 401k plans, on retirement saving plans. And the result is pretty significant. So this company is on a path of being successful, but we almost died twice.

(01:02:44):
And look, all the CEOs in the world, if you would ask them, have you nearly died already? And they will tell you yes. And then the next question would be how many times? And they will tell you multiple times. And if they're not, that means that they're simply too early on their journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
That's such an important point. It came up, I just had Toby from Shopify on the podcast, and he said exactly the same thing. That just like the number of times Shopify almost died, people have no idea. It's important to know, that's very common.

Uri Levine (01:03:17):
Yeah. And I'm a good friend with Harley Finkelstein, the president of Shopify, and he told ... we exchanged horror stories about nearly dying. And we are still here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:30):
Just never give up. To double down on this pivot point real quick. So the things you should look at to help you decide if a pivot is a good idea, you shared, you have some tech that might be helpful in this new direction, you have a team that's really well suited to this new idea or you have some knowledge. Is there anything else, just like what's that list of things you should look at to see, to come up with ideas/decide this is a good idea for us to pursue?

Uri Levine (01:03:57):
So going back to basic, but now you are already running, so you probably have already validated the problem or the value proposition. About pivoting, so when you start you think that, okay, I have this brilliant idea. And what I really encourage people is first of all, go and validate the problem, speak with people, understand their perception of the problem. And only then start to think about the solution. Now, this is still not the case in most startups. And this is fall in love with the problem, not the solution. And for a few reasons, and maybe number one reason is, look, entrepreneurship journey is about creating value. Simplest way to create value, seel a product, that's it, simplest way. And I like simple.

(01:04:50):
But then in addition, when you focus on the problem, then the problem is going to serve as the north star of your journey. And when you have a north star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and increase the likelihood of being successful. But by and large, your story is going to be way more compelling. If we will be here in 2007, and I will tell you that I'm going to build an AI crowdsourced based navigation system, you're going to say, "Oh yeah, very interesting," But you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care. When your customer care, they want you to be successful. And when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.

(01:05:31):
And so this is going back into pivoting the same way, first of all, validate what's your value proposition, what's the problem you're going to solve. Now, in most cases you already validated that because you in the market for some years and you had dialogues with customers and you already realized that. And maybe you already told yourself, you know what? In my next startup this is what I'm going to do. And so it's possible that you already validated. And if you haven't, then this is exactly the time to revalidate the value proposition. So this is the first thing that you need to do.

(01:06:06):
And then the second thing that you want to do is ask yourself, do I really have a significant advantage here? Do I really have the team, the technology, the know-how to make a leap from here and really lead the market?

(01:06:22):
And then the other part of it is, okay, do I have the energy and the passion to go and do it all over again? Because this is going back to square one, trying to figure out product market fit and then figuring out business model and then figuring out growth and so forth. So the entire journey from scratch. And if you answer yes to all of those, so you have the very significant value proposition and you think that you have something that is going to accelerate you dramatically because of the know-how, the technology, the team, then the next thing that you're going to do is validate it with the team.

(01:07:05):
In your underlining assumptions the team is going to continue. Maybe, maybe not. This is exactly the time that you would like to validate that. And the way that you're going to validate that is you basically say to them, "Guess what? We are fucked. Our underlining assumptions are no longer valid. And this is our new opportunity and we can go this path or we can die." And let's see what people, if they believe in the new path, then this is a good idea.

(01:07:36):
In many cases, by the way, it's possible that the new path will come from them. They're the one that are closer to the customers, they're the one that are closer to the technology. They're the one that are probably know better than you if this new path is actually valid or not. And if this is the case, then you go and do it.

(01:07:56):
The last one that you want to ... Look, even if you don't have the money for it, let's say that you don't have plenty of cash in the bank, go back to the investors and go back to raise capital because now you actually have a very significant advantage. You already have a technology, you already have a team, you already have the know-how, you are already second time entrepreneur because pivot is like restarting from scratch or you are already multiple times entrepreneur, so you are way more attractive today than when you were a few years back. And so go back to existing investors and new investors and raise more capital for this new journey.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):
I like this algorithm. I was writing it down as you're talking. So basically when you're deciding to pivot, looking for opportunities to pivot, step one is find a problem, validate there's a problem that exists. Step two is figure out if you have the tech, team or know-how that gives you an advantage to win at solving this problem. Then ask yourself, do you have the passion and energy to be spending your life and the many number of years attacking this problem? Then validate your team, wants to also go after this problem. And then check with your investors and try to get money to fund you going after this problem.

Uri Levine (01:09:16):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
Awesome.

Uri Levine (01:09:17):
And I like this order now. Some people will tell you, "Oh, my order is different." And I'm not saying if this is the right thing or the wrong thing, but I think that ... One of the reason that I say this is the order is, look, when you validate the problem and the value proposition, even if you don't have the passion, if it's been validated, your passion will be built up. Because then you speak with potential customers and you tell them, "This is what I'm thinking of doing and this is how it's going to help you." They will say, "Yes, I need that. Can you do it tomorrow?" Then all of a sudden you get excited about it.

(01:10:05):
And usually when I speak about consumers then I tell people, look, when you go and speak about the problem, if the answer that you are going to get is, "Oh, I know someone that had this problem," don't follow this path. If they will tell you, "No, no, no, no, no, this is not the problem, the problem is," and they will give you their version of the problem, this is where you want to follow that. To a certain point, if you speak with enough people, you would have the sense that you are being sent on a mission. And this is where your passion is going to go through the roof. And so don't start with the passion, let the passion be built.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):
I totally feel that. I have friends who started this company Zip, which is a procurement, a really good procurement platform. And I don't know if they were growing up wanting to be building a business that helps procurement experiences be better. And they pivoted six times before they picked this idea. But through that, I think found how big of a deal this was and how much happier people can be in their day to day with a better product and got excited about it. And now that's what they're building.

Uri Levine (01:11:14):
The best thing happen when you try to validate a problem is that you speak with someone and they will tell you in a very strong emotional word, "I hate that," or something like that. Yeah, this is exactly what you're looking for, you're looking for something that people will engage emotionally and with strong emotions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:34):
Someone once described it as you want to look for their pupils to dilate when you tell them, when you talk about this problem.

Uri Levine (01:11:39):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:40):
There was a quote I wrote down as you were talking earlier that I think is really great. It's kind of a framework for ... the way you used it is to help you pick which direction to go. But I think it's a useful framework in general for companies and founders is ask yourself, if I were to start today, what would I have done and what would I do if I were to start this company again today? I think that's such a powerful thing to always think about even when everything's going great.

Uri Levine (01:12:03):
I agree. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. And this is pretty much everything in your life. So ask yourself, knowing what I know today, would I do something different? Now, if the answer is yes, then do something different today. Don't wait until next life or next company or next relationship or next something. If you basically know today that you should be doing something different, then change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:33):
I think that's extra important because somebody will do that probably and compete with you and put you out of business, and it's better that you do that first.

Uri Levine (01:12:42):
But this is true for everything in your life. Look, if you are working in a place and you are not happy and you suffer there, then I would say ... The guidance that I give to my children is very simple. If you're not happy at your working place, then ask yourself, is there something that I can do to change that? Then try to change that for the next three month. If you're unable to change that, then leave. You don't deserve to be unhappy. And you need to control your own destiny. For me, quitting your job, do you know what it means? You fire your own job boss, that's what it means. You fire your boss by quitting, that's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):
That's empowering, I like that. Okay, just, okay, two more questions. One is I want to close the loop on the Waze story. So you talked about how Google launched, a competitor basically, free turn-by-turn directions, that was the business you were building and you essentially had to change direction. What did you actually do, how did you decide and realize this?

Uri Levine (01:13:57):
We didn't change. Back in 2010, we were simply not good enough, we were still in the product market fit iterations and iterations and iterations, and we were not good enough. And we kept on building and we kept on iterating and iterating and iterating. But we almost ran out of cash. And then we had this lucky day that Microsoft decided to invest, and so did Qualcomm. The funny part is that I had this dialogue with Qualcomm Ventures and they told me that they're not sure why is that important for them. And I read someplace that they did not invest at Twitter at $55 million. And this is exactly what I told them, "May I remind you that you did not invest in Twitter at $55 million valuation. This is where Waze is today." And obviously different story, but that was the fear of missing out, the FOMO was [inaudible 01:14:58]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Yeah, I was going to say, good FOMO.

Uri Levine (01:15:00):
But the result was that we had enough cash to keep on trying and keep on iterating and iterating and iterating. And eventually we ended up to be very successful. So that was not about pivoting or changing directions or doing anything dramatic. We basically say, okay, we will need to reduce costs dramatically. We decided that we are not ... By the way, what we did is we reduced the salary of the management only. And to a certain extent I would say people didn't even know. We decided in the management meeting that this is what we're going to do. And if push come to shovel, then we will do the next step and the next step and the next step. But we were eventually able to raise capital. So in that sense, the nearly die was a matter of state of mind, but we did not run out of cash, we raised capital just before that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:01):
The story is actually really illustrative of a point I was thinking as you were talking, which is that product market fit crisis often also leads to a cash crisis from investors not wanting to invest.

Uri Levine (01:16:12):
In many cases, yes, in many cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:14):
You get a double whammy.

Uri Levine (01:16:18):
But to a certain extent I would say no. Product market fit basically means that you go back to square one. The other alternative that you have, and by the way it's also valid, is if you are unable to convince your existing investors to reinvest in the company in order to build the new part of the journey, the new journey, then you know what? Shut down the company and restart a new company that is doing exactly that. And that's a bigger threat for investors because they are not part of the new journey. Now, they might want to say, "Oh, the company owns the IP." The know-how is the people, owned by the people, not the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
How do you avoid the crisis? A lot this advice is here, you have a crisis, here's how to deal with it. Any advice for how to avoid falling into a crisis as a founder?

Uri Levine (01:17:17):
Number one answer is no. Don't worry, you will face crisis. And if you worry, you're still going to face crisis. Number two is that, look, it's way easier to deal with a crisis if you have plenty of cash in the bank. So if you can raise capital and maintain higher level of cash in the bank, it will help you to go through the next crisis, but it's not going to avoid it. So always be funded is a good advice. But in general, look, you do not prepare for the next crisis because you don't know what kind of crisis it's going to be next. And you can assume that there will be the next crisis. Trust me, there will be the next crisis. And then the most important part is that you analyze that fast and then you act fast. But you cannot prepare for it because you don't know where it's going to come from. And this is really, really important. The best preparation is that if you have plenty of cash. In general I would say if you have plenty of cash, then this is going to help you for many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:36):
When you say plenty of cash, do you have any advice, kind of common advice of have 18 months of runway, is there anything there you'd recommend for founders?

Uri Levine (01:18:44):
And this is really depending on the CEOs and their risk attitude. Some of my CEOs prefer to have two to three years of run rate. They basically say, "This is my comfort zone. I know that I can restart if I need to. I know that I can suffer major crisis. I know that I can go into new direction if I want to. I know that I can expand and try something completely different if I want to." And this is not necessarily as a result of a crisis. So maybe you basically say here is an opportunity and I have the cash to do that.

(01:19:22):
My general rule will be around 18 month. Are you okay with 12 month? Yeah, if you risk taker, bigger risk taker then you can survive with 12 month. But the challenge is that, look, if you have shorter period of time, then you don't have enough time to execute, you need to focus on fundraising all the time. And you want to focus on creating value and not just bringing cash into the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:53):
Yeah. Obviously the downside of raising more runway is you're giving away more of your company, but it's always this trade off, how much to sell, how money to get. Being a founder, what a tough gig. And I'm going to come back to this quote you had that I shared at the beginning of the podcast, which is building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next.

Uri Levine (01:20:13):
Yeah. It goes back into how ... the other three dimensions of a startup, it's a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs, and it's a journey of failures because we are trying to build something new that no one did before so we tried multiple things. For that, Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed that because you haven't tried new things before. And it's a long journey, it's a very long journey. In particular, the longest part is until you figure out product market fit. And now I add the fourth dimension of that, that this is a journey from one crisis to the next one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):
How many companies have you started, 10 last time I saw?

Uri Levine (01:20:54):
Yeah, about, a little bit more than that, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:57):
A little bit more than that.

Uri Levine (01:21:02):
Not all of them are going to be successful, but most of them are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:07):
In some form. And you just keep doing it. You're a glutton for crisis is what I'm hearing here.

Uri Levine (01:21:15):
I'm not here for the crisis, I'm there for the value creation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):
Uri, is there anything else that you wanted to share that you think might be helpful to get into before we wrap up?

Uri Levine (01:21:31):
I really like this podcast, I really like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
Me too.

Uri Levine (01:21:36):
And hopefully, in my mind, this is my mindset of a teacher, my destiny is about value creation, and if this podcast or this book, this one, can help people to become more successful, then I fulfill my destiny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:58):
Uri, I'm so delighted to be helping you fulfill your destiny. Two final questions. Where can folks find the book? When is it for sale? And then just how can listeners be useful to you?

Uri Levine (01:22:08):
The book is going to be published in about a month from now. And it is already available for pre-orders on Amazon, but later on it will be on bookstores throughout the US and Canada and so forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
What's the date it'll be published because we're recording this ... Maybe it's coming out around the time we publish this. So what's the date?

Uri Levine (01:22:26):
I think it's February 15th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:29):
Okay, great. I think this is coming out right around there, so perfect timing.

Uri Levine (01:22:32):
So perfect timing. And you can follow me on LinkedIn or you can go to my website, urilevine.com. And I want you to read the book. End of the day, you asked me at the beginning what do I want to accomplish? Do I want people to buy the book or read the book? And I told you, "Look, everything that I'm trying to do in my life is about doing good and doing well." So buying the book is the doing well part of it and reading the book is the doing good part of it. And I want you to read the book.

# Building a magical AI code editor used by over 1m developers in 4 months: Inside Windsurf

## Transcript

Varun Mohan (00:00:00):
A lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks away. We should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of existing product look dumb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:00:16):
I want the company to almost be like this dehydrated entity. Every hire is like a little bit of water, and we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Any other there skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:00:29):
The engineers are now able to produce more technology. The ROI of building technology has actually gone up. This actually means you hire more. The best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. You could be a force multiplier to your organization in ways in which they never even anticipated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
Today my guest is Varun Mohan. Varun is the co-founder and CEO of Windsurf, which has quickly become one of people's favorite AI coding tools, and is basically the main competitor to Cursor with over 1 million users four months in. In our conversation, Varun shares what makes Windsurf unique, why they decided to invest heavily in enterprise sales very early in their history, why agency is going to be the most important skill for engineers and product builders to build, also the story of how they started out as a GPU infrastructure company and realized there was a much bigger opportunity up the stack and the two pivots that got them to where they're today.

(00:01:20):
He also gives a live demo, advice for being successful at Windsurf, and so much more. There's so much to learn about where things are heading for engineers and product builders in general in this conversation. And I'm really excited to bring it to you.

(00:04:00):
Varun, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Varun Mohan (00:04:03):
Buddy, thanks for having me. A long time listener.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:05):
Oh, I really appreciate that. I'm so excited to have you here. I feel like just you guys have become this overnight success, which is definitely not an overnight success, but I feel like I've been hearing about Windsurf more and more as people's favorite AI tool. And I just don't think people know the story behind Windsurf, behind Codeium, the company that you built. So I thought it'd be good to maybe just start there and have you just briefly share the history of Codeium and how Windsurf emerged out of Codeium.

Varun Mohan (00:04:31):
Yeah. So the company was actually started close to four years ago. As you know, AI coding was not a thing four years ago. ChatGPT was not out four years ago. At the time, we actually started out building GPU virtualization and compiler software. Before this, I worked in autonomous vehicles. My co-founder, who I had known since middle school, worked on AR/VR at Meta. And for us, we believe deep learning would touch many, many industries. It wouldn't just touch autonomous vehicles. It would touch financial services, defense, healthcare. And we believe these applications were hard to build, these deep learning applications. So we made it possible for you to effectively run these complex applications on computers without GPUs, and we would handle all the complexity of being able to actually run the workload on the GPUs for you. And we were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:05:20):
And in the middle of 2022 rolled around and we had a couple million in revenue and we were managing upwards of 10,000 sort of GPUs. We had eight people. At the time, we were free cash flow positive. But I think what we felt was once these generative models started to get very good, we sort of felt a lot of what we built was not as valuable. And this was a very, very hard moment for us at the company. We were only eight people at the time, but we felt, "Hey, would people be training these very bespoke sentiment classifier models anymore that were very, very custom models? Or would they just ask GPT-N, is this a positive or a negative sentiment?" Probably it's going to be the latter, right? And in a world in which everyone was going to run generative AI models, why would an infrastructure company be a differentiator? Because everyone is going to run the same kind of infrastructure down the line.

(00:06:06):
So instead what we decided to do was we believe generative AI was almost going to be like the next internet. And in that case, what we should go out and do is build the next great apps like Google, like Amazon. And we vertically integrated and actually took our infrastructure, our inference infrastructure to go out and build Codeium at the time. And at that time, we were early adopters of GitHub Copilot and we thought the coding space was going to get tremendously disrupted in the next coming years. So we actually took our infrastructure, we ran our own models in massive scale. We even trained our own models.

(00:06:35):
In the very beginning it was very, very simple. It was purely an autocomplete model, which basically means that as the user was typing, we'd complete the next one or two or three or four lines of code. But we provided the product entirely for free in all the IDEs that developers coded. That meant to VSCode, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Vim, Emacs. And the reason why we were able to build it for free was because of our infrastructure background. We were able to optimize these workloads a ton.

(00:07:04):
I guess very quickly after that, some large businesses also wanted to work with us. And we built out this enterprise motion to work with these large companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. And for them the bigger thing wasn't just, "Hey, could we autocomplete code or could we chat with the code base?" It was, "Could you offer us a secure offering that was also personalized to all the private data inside the company?" So we took our infrastructure and made it so that we invested a ton in making sure that we deeply understood these large companies code bases. And that's what we were working on until six months ago.

(00:07:33):
It's not that we've stopped working on that, but basically what we realized six months ago was we were getting limited by the IDEs that we were already working in. So VSCode, which is a very popular IDE, had a ceiling for the AI capabilities, we could showcase our users. And because of that, we decided to go out and fork VSCode and build our own IDE with some of these new agentic capabilities. And over time in the last couple of years, the model capabilities have also been growing exponentially year over year. And that's sort of where we are right now. I skipped a lot of pieces there, but that's what we're landed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:05):
There's so many interesting threads there. One is just, there's always this question of just where value will accrue in AI. And it's so interesting, you guys started almost at the bottom layer of infrastructure GPUs and then you went to what people call a GPT wrapper, not actually. So I guess any just lessons there, just thoughts on just where you think value will end up in this world of AI and the stack of AI tools?

Varun Mohan (00:08:28):
Maybe I can start by just saying one thing about startups that I think are really true, it's very unlikely the first thing that you believe you should go work on is going to be the right thing, which is a very hard thing to kind of wrangle with being a startup founder, right? You need to kind of be irrationally optimistic that what you're going to do is going to be differentially important. Because otherwise, why would you go out and do what you're doing? And if it's obvious, then a bigger company would've already done it, right?

(00:08:56):
But then you also need to be really, really realistic because most ideas that are, I guess, non-conventional are usually bad ideas, right? So it's this weird tightrope you need to kind of balance on top of where you're pushing for a future that you believe is true, but all the while you're getting new information. You need to kill the beliefs that you had. And if I were to start with the infrastructure piece, we first went in with the assumption that model architectures were going to be really, really heterogeneous.

(00:09:27):
Working from an autonomous vehicle background, there were many different types of model architectures out there. There were convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, sort of lighter neural nets with frustrum point networks. And there were maybe tens of architectures we were dealing with. And at that point we were like, the complexity of this is so high that it's very clear if someone offloaded the complexity, there would be a lot of value.

(00:09:50):
Fast-forward to the middle of 2023, everything looks like it's going to be a transformer. So now our hypotheses are just wrong. So at this point then, most of the value is probably not going to accrue at purely the, at least this is our belief, at the infrastructure layer. It's going to accrue somewhere else. Where is the layer that you can actually differentiate on? And we believe the application layer is a very, very deep layer to go out and differentiate on, right? What are the number of ways we can build better user experiences and better workflows for developers? We think there's effectively no ceiling on that, on how much better we can make the lives of developers basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
You touched on the second thread that I thought was really interesting here, is just how you guys pivoted from ideas that were working. You were making money, people loved it. You said you had millions of dollars of ARR revenue. And then you're just like, "No, we're going to completely change the business."

(00:10:36):
So the question there is, just like, what have you learned about knowing what to follow? And one thing I heard there that was really interesting is just once your assumptions change about that you built your idea on, it's time to think this idea and maybe try something else.

Varun Mohan (00:10:48):
I think the way we sort of think about this is even when we're working right now, we just accept that we're going to get a lot of things wrong. We're just going to get a lot of things wrong. Obviously that's a very big moment because that was a bet the company moment in the sense that we basically said, told our investors, "Hey, we're making money on this." We had already raised 28 million of capital and we were just like, "Hey, we're just going to pivot entirely from this." And we did that overnight. This wasn't this thing where we just said, "Hey, maybe a quarter, one or two quarters." Because one of the things we knew that's very important for startups is focus.

(00:11:20):
If you're trying to do another thing that you think is big and you're focused on something that you don't believe is valuable, you're guaranteed going to fail at the thing you think is going to be big. So that's a very obvious thing there. But I think once you go in with the assumption that a lot of your hypotheses are going to be wrong, but you will do the most concentrated work possible to go out and validate these hypotheses and you won't be in love with your ideas.

(00:11:41):
I think ideas, it's awesome when you have a great idea, but you should never be too in love with your ideas. And you have an organization that is very truth-seeking. I think a lot of people at the company have had their ideas tested over and over again. Even just building Windsurf. That is not a complete company pivot, but that's a big decision that we made at the company. You kind of need to make some bets. And sometimes you're wrong and sometimes you're right. But if you have an organization that comes out and you feel like morale is not going to be low if you made the wrong decision, that's the best, right? That means you have optionality for the rest of time.

(00:12:14):
And Lenny, one thing that I try to tell the company about this is, this year the total amount of engineering output we'll have is much larger than the engineering output we've had since the beginning of the company's creation 'till now. So that almost means every year is a new lease on life for us, right? It's almost a new way for us to test out an entirely new set of hypotheses. And maybe we were wrong about our original hypotheses in the first place. What makes us more smart than everyone else to be right more times than that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):
That's so empowering. It makes me think about... Uri Levine was on the podcast, co-founder of Waze, and he has this phrase that he wears on his shirt. His book is called this Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution. And that feels like that's exactly what you're describing.

(00:12:59):
Okay, so let's talk about Windsurf. What's the simplest way for people to understand what is Windsurf?

Varun Mohan (00:13:04):
Yeah. So Windsurf is an IDE, right? It's an application to go out and build software and build applications. The crazy thing is a lot of people who use the product don't even probably know what an IDE is, which is crazy. And we'll get into that in a second.

(00:13:22):
But why did we go out and build Windsurf and what is Windsurf maybe? Why couldn't we have just done this on top of conventional IDEs like Visual Studio Code? So maybe just to get into this a little bit, as we saw that AI was getting more and more powerful, the way people go out and build technology, we thought the interface for that was going to change remarkably. It was not going to be a conventional pure text editor where the user is writing a handful of lines of code or most of the code and the IDE provides maybe some basic feedback on what the user is doing right or wrong. And the basic feedback could be, "Hey, there's a bug in your software or compiler error in your software." It could do much more, right? It could actually go out and modify large chunks of code.

(00:14:04):
One of the key pieces that we recognized was, with this new paradigm with AI, AI was probably going to write well over 90% of the software, in which case the role of a developer and what they're doing in the IDE is maybe reviewing code. Maybe it's actually a little bit different than what it is in the past. And we'll see this very soon with Windsurf. Maybe when you're using the product, actually a good chunk of the user's time is that you're reviewing what the AI is outputting. So we needed to build custom-review flows into the IDE to actually make it so that it was easier to actually go out and do that, right? Because the developer is not spending all their time writing code.

(00:14:38):
And this is the fundamental premise on why we built the product. We thought we were going to get limited a ton if we had very, very basic UI out there. And I'll give you even a simple example here. We have this auto-complete product that completes a handful of lines of code. Now we've actually launched this offering called Windsurf Tab that basically shows you refactors as well. And these refactors are almost inline refactors. And we were able to build a custom UI for that in Windsurf.

(00:15:03):
But in VSCode, because of the access to the APIs, we needed to dynamically generate images right alongside the user's cursor because we just didn't have access to the capabilities to showcase and edit properly. And what we realized is immediately by porting over to Windsurf, our acceptance rate tripled. Same ML models, it just tripled. So what that, I guess, gave us confidence in is yeah, you could argue technology is very important. And I think technology is very important. But if our users are getting very little value from the technology we're sort of building, you need to really clarify, "Maybe we do need to build a new surface and interface." And that's what Windsurf is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:39):
So the big bet you took there just to make this super clear, is you were initially working within existing IDEs that everyone was familiar with. And then it was like, "This isn't going to get us where we need to go. We're going to try to convince people to switch to something completely new because it's going to be so much better. It's our own IDE."

(00:15:56):
I think maybe people may not recognize just how risky that is, convincing engineers to use something completely new. That's a huge deal.

Varun Mohan (00:16:02):
Yeah, no, of course. And one of the key pieces, maybe Lenny, that would be important to share is a lot of our developers do use Visual Studio Code. But there are lots of people that write in languages like Java, sort of C++ and so on and so forth, and they might use the JetBrains family of IDEs that like IntelliJ. And for us, we are actually still committed to building on those platforms, right? We just felt though that one of the dominant IDEs, which was Visual Studio Code, was limiting the sort of user interface that we could give to our actual customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):
What is the current state of traction for Windsurf? You hear all these crazy numbers about all the competitors in your space. What can you share there for folks just to know?

Varun Mohan (00:16:43):
Yeah, so maybe a handful. We launched the product a bit over four months ago. And in that period of time, over a million developers have tried the product. And obviously we have many hundreds of thousands of monthly active users right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):
I love how these days like, "oh, a million. Oh, no big deal." It's just the numbers are absurd these days. We're just getting used to just 100 million ARR here, million users in four months there. It's just like, "Oh, of course. How could you not have that?" But that's absurd. It's just like an insane time right now.

(00:17:12):
You touched on something that I wanted to get to later, but I may as well bring it up now, the question of just how engineering will change in the future. You throw out the stat that 90% of code is going to be written by AI in the future. Dario from Anthropic recently said the same thing. You guys have a really interesting glimpse into just how things will look in the future.

(00:17:31):
So I guess the question is just, how do you think coding specifically will look in the next few years, how different will it be from today?

Varun Mohan (00:17:39):
I think when we think about what is an engineer actually doing, it probably falls into three buckets, right? What should I solve for? How should I solve it? And then solving it. I guess everyone who's working in this space is probably increasingly convinced that solving it, which is just the pure, "I know how I'm going to do it" and just going and doing it. AI is going to handle vast majority, if not all of it. In fact, it probably actually, with some of the work that we've done in terms of deeply understanding code bases, how should I solve it is also going to get closer and closer to getting done. If you deeply understand the environment inside an organization, if you deeply understand the code base, how you should solve it, given best practices when the company also gets solved.

(00:18:19):
So I think what engineering kind of goes to is actually what you wanted engineers to do in the first place, which is, what are the most important business problems that we do need to solve? What are the most important capabilities that we need our application, our product to have? And actually going and prioritizing those and actually going and making the right technical decisions to go out and doing it. And I think that's where engineering is probably heading towards.

(00:18:40):
Now, does that mean that no one needs a CS degree? I think that's maybe a little bit overplayed a little bit just because maybe here's my argument for that. A lot of developers nowadays that build full stack applications, at least until a handful of years ago, they probably went to college and took an operating system course. And in theory, they're not really playing around with the operating system, like the kernel scheduler very frequently. But do those principles help them in understanding why their applications are slow? Do they help them in understanding why some design decisions are better than the other? Yeah, that makes them a much better engineer than another engineer. And I think that idea and the understanding of what's going on at the bottom will make a good engineer even better. But also at the same time, it empowers a bunch of people that never understood all of those things, how to actually build as well, which is another remarkable sort of thing that fell out through this whole process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I don't know if you have kids, but just say you had kids or you had niece or nephew going into college, let's say, would you suggest they do do computer science or would you suggest you're not going to have a good time if that's the career you choose right now?

Varun Mohan (00:19:47):
Yeah. Maybe I think back a little bit. So I went to MIT. A lot of us at the company went to MIT together on the engineering team. I think when I think about what we learned the most for engineering or computer science, it was not exactly like how do you write code. That is almost a given that you can write code after going to college. It's more like the principles of how you think about a problem and how you break it down and how you solve it in an interesting way.

(00:20:15):
So an example of a class that I really enjoyed was our distributed systems class. And there, you're kind of reading through literature and understanding how some design decisions were kind of made. And I think it's more like a problem solving kind of course and a major. It's a major of how you solve problems given some constraints of how computers today function, right? Like, here's the speed at which memory sort of operates. Here's the speed at which... Here's how much computation you can do in one cycle or one second. And based on that, you can make some trade-offs and solve a problem.

(00:20:45):
So I don't know if I would say that you shouldn't go get a computer science degree. I think computer science is almost synonymous with problem solving. In that case, I think it's pretty valuable. Is everything you learn in your computer science degree useful? I'd say a lot of things that I learned in my computer science degree are not useful. I'll give you an example. I took a parallel computing class in Julia. I don't think Julia is a very popular programming language anymore. Am I very sad that I took the class? No. The principles of parallel computing are still very useful, I would say, today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
So what I'm hearing is, skills that you still want to build, whether it's computer science or maybe some version of computer science, is kind of building the mental model of how computers and systems work.

Varun Mohan (00:21:12):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):
Parallel processing, memory, hard drives, internet, things like that. And then there's just problem solving skills, being able to solve interesting problems. Is there any other skills you think people should be investing more in with the rise of AI building more and more of our products?

Varun Mohan (00:21:37):
I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit undervalued is this kind of agency piece. And I think about this a lot, which is, you have a lot of people that could go through college and go through school and they're basically told exactly what to do on a P-set. They're given these very, very, I would say, well-defined paths that they need to take. I think maybe in society and just school, we don't prioritize how do you make sure you get people with real agency that want to build something, right? Their goal is not just to maybe graduate from college and then get a job at a big tech company where they're told exactly what to do or where to put the pixel for this one website. I think that's maybe a skill set that is undervalued just right now, probably in the last maybe 10 years or so. And I think that's going to be really, really important.

(00:22:27):
For a startup, obviously these are skills that we just look for. We look for people that are really high agency because we just recognize that by default, if we don't innovate and do crazy things, we're going to die. The company is just going to die. So we just look for this, right? But I would say for most software engineering jobs, that's probably not the case. Just think about big company X and what they're hiring for on the average software engineering interview. It probably doesn't look like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:52):
I love how you phrased that. If we don't do crazy things and innovate, we're going to die. That would be a great title for this podcast episode. And I think, I know, it's 100% true. There's just a lot of crazy things happening and a lot of innovation happening. And if you can't keep up, you'll die.

(00:23:07):
So let's talk about hiring. You have a really interesting approach to hiring. There's a few questions I have here. One is just how do you... I know you try to stay really lean. That's a common theme across all the AI startups these days. How do you know when it's time to hire someone?

Varun Mohan (00:23:22):
I love the idea of being a lean company, but I don't idolize it in the way that, "Hey, it is a dream to be a 10% or 20% company that's making 50, 100, 200 million in revenue." That's not, I think, what we idolize inside the company.

(00:23:36):
I think what we idolize is, be the smallest company we can be to satisfy our ambitions. That's what the goal is. And maybe, Lenny, the way I would sort of put that out there is, if I told you, "Hey, I'm going to build an autonomous vehicle," and I said our team is 10 people, you should rightfully say, "Hey Varun, you're not serious. And you'd be right. I'm not serious at that point. So I think the answer is, what is the minimum number of people to go out and build the crazy ambition project that you have?

(00:24:04):
And I think the project we are trying to go out and do, which is completely transform the way software gets built, we've mentioned this [inaudible 00:24:11] the company, our goal is to reduce the time it takes to build apps and technology by 99%, right? It is a tremendously sort of ambitious goal. And it's not possible for us to be a 10, 20, 30, 40 person engineering team in the long term and actually satisfy that goal. We think there's a very, very high ceiling. So that's maybe the first key piece there. It's like, if we can crack actually being a fairly sizable company but still operate as if we're a startup, that's the dream. That's the dream.

(00:24:40):
In terms of hiring philosophy, the way we sort of think about things is, we only hire for a role if we're actually underwater for that function. So let's say we're going out and building inference technology. Unless we're underwater there, we will not go out and hire someone to go out and work for that. And the reason for that is, I actually think this is a feature. When you hire for a role and you already have enough people there, you get a lot of weird politics that ultimately ends up happening. And it's not because people are bad people. I think most people are really well-intentioned. But what happens when you have people that join a company and in reality you didn't really need them? They will go out and manufacture some other thing that they should go work on. They will go out and figure out something else to work on. And realistically, it's not that important, but they will go out and try to convince the rest of the organization that it is important.

(00:25:30):
I just think as a startup, we don't have the bandwidth to go out and deal with that, right? For me, I would like to see everyone just almost be raising their hands up being like, "I'm dying. We need one more person." And that's when we go out and hire someone. And one of the analogies I like to give is, I want the company to almost be this dehydrated entity and every hire is like a little bit of water. And we only go back and hire someone when we're back to being dehydrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):
I love this metaphor so much. And it sounds painful. It sounds painful that you need to be underwater and raising your hand, "I'm about to die and dehydrated." But I also know that it's a really exciting way to work. It sounds hard, but if you're in it, it's just like... I guess talk about just that side of it because I think it could sound like, "This is terrible. I don't want to work this way."

Varun Mohan (00:26:19):
You know what I actually think, Lenny? It's really good for a handful of reasons, which is that a lot of the... We respect and trust the people that work at the company. So this forces ruthless prioritization. You have a team that's going out and doing something. They will never ask to work on something that's not important. In fact, if there are two things that they're working on, they're just going to just tell me, "Hey, there are two things on my plate. I just don't have the ability to do two. I can only do one." And they will pick the one that's most important.

(00:26:45):
And this actually goes back to one thing that I think is true about startups and just companies in general. You don't win by doing 10 things well. You win by doing one thing really well and maybe you fail nine things. This is the thing that I've told the company, "This is very different than school," right? In school you optimize for your total GPA. But for companies, I just need to get an A+ on the one class that matters. And then I can get an F in all the other classes. And an F in all the other classes doesn't mean just doing illegal things. That basically means you just deprioritize things that don't matter. That actually forces this organizational prioritization that is just really, really good.

(00:27:22):
And Douglas and I, Douglas being my co-founder, we can tell the company, "These are the two things that are the most important." But if we go out and tell these are the two things that are the most important to the company and then we put the company has 20% more people than necessary, what's going to ultimately happen? It's almost a forcing function for ruthless prioritization to have fewer people or people that are just underwater internally at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:46):
Everyone listening that works at a big company knows exactly what you mean when you described when there's just too many people, they will all find work to do and they will all be pitching ideas. They all want to show impact, they want to do well in their performance reviews. That's just the nature of too many people at a company. And so I think this all really resonates.

(00:28:04):
To even getting even deeper on just what it looks like when someone's underwater to tell you it's time to hire, is it just someone coming to you, "Varun, I need someone on this team. This is just not possible"? What does that look like even more practically?

Varun Mohan (00:28:16):
Yeah, I think it's basically along those lines. It's that, "Hey, there's some pressure to get something done in a short period of time." By the way, one of the things that we do believe though for software, if you want to do great things, it's not possible to just say, "Hey, I want to get it done in one month" if it is like... Because you have to think about it from this perspective. If a software project could get built in two to three weeks, what does that really mean about the true complexity and differentiation of what you built? It's probably not very high, unless you believe you are way smarter than everyone else. But I think that's hubris, right? I think we actually have a very exceptional engineering team. But also at the same time, I don't think our engineering team is so exceptional that we can do things in three weeks that the rest of the world can't do in six to nine months. That's kind of stupid to believe that.

(00:28:57):
So I think basically it comes down to that person coming out and being like, "Hey, look, I don't have enough time to do X." Us having a conversation to be like, "Okay, what can you do then?" And if the answer is, "I can only do less than that," then maybe we make a decision actually, "Oh wow, that's great. Maybe we actually should deprioritize Y." Because this is actually also another thing that's very hard even for people like me and my co-founder. It's that we also want to do a lot of things. There's an urge to do a lot of things. But if we are forced to make a decision constantly on like, "We cannot do X," it's very clarifying. It's very clarifying because our engineering interview process is also extremely low acceptance rate. So it's not very easy for us to very quickly spin up people and have them join the company really, really quickly either.

(00:29:43):
So I think it's clarifying for everyone. It's clarifying for the person that wants more people. We can just tell them, "Hey look, we don't believe you should be doing this other thing." And it's also clarifying for us because we can also get on the same page with them. And sometimes we just kind of agree, "Hey..." Our teams are very flexible that, "Hey, actually we do need to get something done." And one of the things that we've kind of tried to make sure is true on our engineering team is, people's value to the company does not have anything to do with the size of their team. There are projects inside the company, there are directly responsible individuals for these projects inside the company. And if we feel like one project is very important, then people can move from one project to the next.

(00:30:21):
There's no notion of someone owning people at the company. That is a very bad and gnarly idea. In fact, the person that is the most valuable at the company is the person that can do the most crazy sort of project out there with as few people as possible. And that's what you should be rewarding internally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
How many people do you have at coding at this point?

Varun Mohan (00:30:37):
So we have close to 160 people and the engineering team is over 50 people right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
Awesome. Oh, what's the other bigger functions? So [inaudible 00:30:46]-

Varun Mohan (00:30:46):
We have go-to-market. We have a... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):
Oh, right. Okay. I want to talk about that, the sales learning that you guys had. Okay. But let's close out this hiring conversation. So we talked about what you look for... To tell you it's the time to hire, what do you look for in the people that you interview and hire?

Varun Mohan (00:31:01):
One of the key pieces that we look for, we have a very high technical bar. So assuming that they actually meet the technical bar, I think we sort of look for people that are really, really passionate about the mission of what we're actually trying to solve and people that are willing to work very hard. I think one of the things that we don't try to do is convince people, "Hey look, we are a very chill company and it's great to work here." I think, no, this is a very exciting space. It's very competitive. You should expect us to lose if the people at the company are not kind of... They're not working very hard. And I think one of the biggest dog whistles I hear is, when I ask people how hard are you willing to work, some people actually ultimately say, "Hey, I work very smart." And I basically ask them a question, "If we have many smart people at our company that also work hard, what's the differentiator going to be? Are you just going to pull them down?"

(00:31:48):
Because I think one of the things that's true about companies is it's like this massive group project. And I think the thing about a person that is not pulling their weight that's bad. It's not the productivity, right? At some point when the company becomes many hundreds of engineers, I'm not going to be thinking about the one engineer that's not pulling their weight. It's the team of people they work with that are almost basically saying, "Is this the bar internally at the company? Is this the expectation?" And I guess, Lenny, if I told you you have a team of five people and the four other people you're working with just don't care, how much are you going to feel like you should care?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:21):
Not too much.

Varun Mohan (00:32:22):
Exactly. So for us, I think that's what we more care about. We have a culture where it's very collaborative. It's not an individual sport, but people feel like they can rely on other people to get complex sort of tasks done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:35):
So the question you asked there just basically is, how hard are you willing to work? How hard do you want to work? And I know some people, there's this whole group of folks that are just like work-life balance, "How dare you ask me to work crazy hours?" And I love just the filter upfront of, "If you work here, you will work really hard. You'll work a lot of hours. It's a crazy space to be in. And we will win by working smart and also really hard."

Varun Mohan (00:33:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):
You said at some point earlier that your engineering pass rate, as you said, it was like 0.6% of candidates, something like that.

Varun Mohan (00:33:10):
Yeah, it's probably post or take home. It's probably that actually. So the take home itself filters probably another 10, 15X on top of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
Here's a question that I've been hearing more and more, is just, how do you do interviews these days with tools like Windsurf out there that solve all your problems?

Varun Mohan (00:33:25):
We are okay with people using the tools because I think one of the worst things is like, if someone comes here and doesn't like using these tools, we believe there are massive productivity improvements. We do bring people into the company on site so we can actually see how they think through problems on a whiteboard and all these other pieces. So we do want to see how they think on their feet and hopefully they're not just taking what we're saying, putting it in a voice translator and sticking it into ChatGPT and getting the answer out.

(00:33:51):
So there is a way to do this. My viewpoint on this is the tools are really, really important, but I do think we still look for some problem solving ability. If the only way you can solve a hard problem is put it into ChatGPT, I think that's a concern to us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:34:22):
Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab.

(00:34:54):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time.

(00:35:24):
Okay. Let's talk about this go-to-market sales experience that you guys had. So you started obviously like most people, started building without sales team. And then you realized, from what I hear, that that was a huge miss and a big opportunity to talk about there because that's really unique, I think, that you guys have a large sales team and go-to-market team.

Varun Mohan (00:35:40):
Yeah, we actually made this decision pretty early in the company's history, I would say. We hired our VP of sales over a year ago actually. And the go-to-market team is now over 80 people inside the company. So it's a pretty sizable function inside the company.

(00:35:55):
Yeah. Maybe a little bit of a backstory here. So when we started the company, actually we had a handful of angels that actually were operators, go-to-market operators. So an example of one was Carlos Delatorre who used to be the CRO of MongoDB. And I think for us, we never viewed enterprise sales and sales as a very negative thing. I think this is a interesting thing that technical founders sometimes don't really like. They think sales is a very negative part of the process. Everything should be product-led growth. I think it's not that black and white. I think enterprise sales is really valuable. But maybe when we were a GPU virtualization company and we were an infrastructure company, the reason why we never hired a salesperson is, I didn't know how to scale the function. I was the one who was selling the product.

(00:36:37):
So ultimately speaking, if it was hard for me to sell the product incrementally, I didn't know how we could make that into a process that we could then go and scale. I didn't know how we could take the revenue of the business from a couple million to hundreds of millions and let alone even tenths. So if I didn't know how to do that, how could I go out and hire someone and make them scale it out?

(00:36:58):
On the other hand, for Codeium, very quickly, a lot of large enterprises reached out to us. And from that alone in the middle of 2023, we started, I guess, me and a handful of other folks at the company started selling the product and we were doing tens of pilots concurrently with large enterprises and we were very quickly able to understand that there was a large enterprise motion that needed to be built in this space. So by the end of 2023, we actually hired our VP of sales. And very quickly after that, scaled our sales team. Yeah, I mean look, if you want to sell to the Fortune 500, it is very hard to do that purely by swiping a credit card.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):
Let's talk about Cursor. I don't want to spend too much time with competitors, but that's what everyone's always thinking about when they think of you guys. You guys are kind of the leading players, I think, in the space also. There's Copilot, but that's different.

(00:37:46):
So what's the simplest way to understand how you guys are different from Cursor and also just how you think you win in the space long-term?

Varun Mohan (00:37:53):
So I think maybe a handful of things that I could share. So on the product side, I think we've invested a lot in making sure code-based understanding for very large code bases is really high quality. And that's just because of where we started. We worked with some of the worlds are just companies like Dell, JPMorgan Chase. Companies like Dell have singular code bases that are over 100 million lines of code. So being able to understand that really, really quickly to make large scale changes is something that we've spent a lot of time doing. And that requires us actually building our own models that can consume large chunks of their code base in parallel across thousands of GPUs and almost rank them to be able to find out what the most important snippets of code are for any question that are asked about the code base. So we've gone out and built large distributed systems based on our infrastructure background to go ahead and do that. That's maybe one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):
Let me actually follow that thread because I think people may underestimate just how big of a deal that is. So when we talk about, we had the founders of Bolt and Lovable on the podcast, so those products, they build something from scratch, they built, they write the code for you. So that versus just loading, say, Windsurf on your million line code base, say, at Airbnb or Uber. Like, understanding what the hell you have and how it works and where to go change things without breaking it is insanely hard. And so what I'm hearing is that's kind of a big differentiator as you guys started there actually. And then Windsurf is now building up that advantage.

Varun Mohan (00:39:15):
That's right. Yeah. So that's a big thing that we spent a lot of time on, which is just understanding what the code base is doing. And actually one of the other things is, what are all the user interactions with respect to the code base? And happy to show that also in a bit here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
Awesome.

Varun Mohan (00:39:31):
The second key piece probably is we're not only tied to Windsurf actually. This is probably a weird statement given even we are talking about Windsurf, which is that actually we're pretty focused on supporting IDEs like JetBrains. JetBrains or IntelliJ has over 70 to 80% of all Java developers coding in JetBrains based IDEs, right? The reason why we don't feel as big a need to almost build a competing product to JetBrains is JetBrains is actually a very sort of extensible product in a way that VSCode is not. VSCode is not very extensible.

(00:40:05):
So I think for us, our goal here is not only just to satisfy a subset of users that can actually switch onto our IDE, but we want to give this agentic sort of experience to every sort of developer out there. And if that means there are Java developers that write in JetBrains, that's fine. We work with a lot of large enterprises that have 10 plus thousand developers where over 50% of the developers are on JetBrains. It's a very large product. And by the way, that company itself is a privately held company that makes many hundreds of millions of dollars a year. So it's a very, very large company. So for us, that's another key piece. We actually want to meet developers sort of where they are. And if they use a different platform, we'll work on that too.

(00:40:42):
The third key piece, and this probably sounds another key piece for enterprises, is we work in a lot of very secure environments. We have FedRAMP compliance, which means we can sell to very large government entities. We have a hybrid mode of actually using the product, which means that all the code that lives that is indexed, it actually lives on the tenant of the user, right? Code is one of the most important pieces of IP for the company. So I think just if you were to look at it from a big company perspective, there are many reasons why over the years of just building an enterprise product, we've handled a lot of complexities that large companies want to see. But that's part of it is because of the history of how we got here in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:21):
Okay, Varun, enough teasing. Let's do a live demo of Windsurf so folks can see what it's like. And then I'm just going to ask you a bunch of questions as we're going through it. So I'll let you pull up a little shared screen where you have Windsurf pulled up.

Varun Mohan (00:41:33):
Great. So some context, this is a very basic React project. There's nothing in it right now. So if you were to open any sort of file, it's the default React app project. I have this basic image here. You can pass Windsurf images of what you'd like the project to look like, of what I would like an Airbnb for dog's website to kind of look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:55):
Beautiful. Beautiful mock-up by the way. I love that this is like all you need.

Varun Mohan (00:41:59):
This is all you need. This is all you need. So basically what we're going to do is we're going to say, "Hey..." One of the cool parts about Windsurf is it can actually work in an existing project already. So I can basically say, "Hey, change this React app to show an Airbnb for dog's website based on this image and preview it."

(00:42:25):
So now it'll just go out and start executing code, reading through the repository. Obviously, it doesn't know what the current code base actually looks like. And it'll go out and analyze the code base to actually find out the set of changes necessary. So we'll go out and wait and see what it's going to do. But while we're doing that, let's continue the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
Awesome. Okay, so first of all, so you open up Windsurf. You had a boilerplate React project ready to go. And Windsurf had never really seen this code before. You ask it to do stuff on your code base, which is just like, "Change this to Airbnb for dogs using this design." Amazing.

Varun Mohan (00:43:03):
That's right. That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Yeah. Okay, cool. So we'll let it run and we'll talk. Let me ask you this question that I've been asking everyone that comes on that is building a product that helps engineers build products and product managers build products and designers.

(00:43:15):
Say you could sit next to every single new user that opens up Windsurf and whisper a couple tips in their ear to help them be successful with the product. What would be a couple tips you'd share?

Varun Mohan (00:43:25):
Tip number one is just be a little bit patient and both patient and explicit. When you ask the application to go out and make some changes, it could actually go out and make many irrelevant changes. One of the things that I think prevents this the most is just be really, really explicit or as explicit as possible. And one of the things I ask people to do is in the beginning, start by making smaller changes. If there's a very large directory, don't go out and make it refactor the entire directory because then if it's wrong, it's going to basically it destroy 20 files.

(00:44:00):
And I think from there, one of the key pieces I think that comes from the users that use the product is they sort of learn what the hills and valleys of the product are. The analogy I like to give are kind of similar to autocomplete. When you use a product like autocomplete, you would think a product that is suggesting things but only getting accepted 30% of the time would be really, really annoying. But the reason why it's not very annoying is actually because you've actually learned that, hey, 70% of the time, I don't need to accept this. And the times that I do, I know to get value from it. And you also know beforehand if a sort of command that you write is very complex, you just expect, "Hey, the autocomplete is not going to work for it." So I think it's almost like a, understand what the hills and valleys of the product are.

(00:44:45):
The crazy thing is, every three months that kind of gets changed and reevaluated. It almost becomes the case that it becomes materially better than it was in the past. So I think maybe patience and being explicit are maybe the two important key pieces I would tell users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):
And I think something that was kind of between the lines there is get a gut feeling of what the model is capable of, like how specific to be versus how abstract it can be. And there's kind of this gut feeling you start to build over time.

Varun Mohan (00:45:12):
That's right. Yeah. And with that, it feels like we have an actual preview. Guess what? We have a nice-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
Cute dogs.

Varun Mohan (00:45:21):
A nice dog app. And one of the cool parts is that we've also done beyond just modifying code is actually being able to point to different pieces. And I guess I could just kind of say... I could point to different elements and say, "Hey, make the background..." This is not great design, but I could basically say, if I took this element, "Make this background red and just take a particular element and just change it and make it red." And it should go out and be able to go out and do this.

(00:45:52):
The preview aspect of the product of being able to showcase the app while it's getting built helps in that, now actually you can live entirely in app world. You don't even maybe even need to look at the code. Granted this looks hideous, but in some ways if I wanted to, I could go out and do that, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:09):
This is what happens when there's no more designers. Like, [inaudible 00:46:11].

Varun Mohan (00:46:11):
Yeah. When there's no more designers. Sure. Maybe the answer is like, when you ask me what should people be doing, they should study great taste. Having great taste. Because I think taste is also a very, very hard, right?

(00:46:22):
But maybe the other key piece, Lenny, that I wanted to showcase here is obviously you could keep going here. I could take different components and kind of change them. We have a lot of plans here that are beyond just point and click changing components. But one of the cool pieces is the AI. There's an AI review flow as well, which is kind of like what I was saying. The goal of AI has now changed a lot in that it is now modifying large chunks of code for you. And the job of a developer now is to actually review a lot of the code that the AI has generated. And granted right now during this podcast, I'm not going to review all the code that's getting generated.

(00:46:57):
But let's say I want to go out and modify some of this code. And this is where if you're an actual developer that actually wants to go modify, maybe I don't like my variable name being called title. I want it to be called Title String instead, like this. And if I wanted to go out and make that change and change to go out and say Title String and that's what I'm going to do, I'm just going to tell the AI to continue.

(00:47:18):
The cool part about this is Windsurf not only knows about what the agent has done. It also knows everything that the user has done. Our goal here is to have this almost flow-like state where everything the user has done, the AI also knows. And it is able to predict the intent. And as you can see, it said, "I noticed that the interface property title was changed to Title String." And then it now has gone out and modified all the locations within the app from title to Title String. And now it no longer says that.

(00:47:45):
So this is where even if I'm writing software and I want to go and make point changes, the AI can go out and quickly make these changes on the user's path. Imagine doing a refactor or a migration and you just change one part of the code. You can just tell the AI to continue the rest. And because it deeply understands the code base, it should go out and find all the corresponding places to go out and make the change. And obviously now when I reload my app, there's no bug in the app. It still loads properly. I could obviously tell it to do even cooler things like make the app retro. I don't know what that means, but I guess I could do that. And it should go out and make the change correspondingly for me.

(00:48:23):
But yeah, that's maybe the high level parts there where the AI is not only able to operate entirely in app space but also on the code space of the users going out and modifying code and to bridge the gap between the two. So it should add leverage not only non-developers that are just purely building apps, but also developers that are just hands-on keyboard too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):
Amazing. By the way, if you're not on YouTube, you can't see, but you can just select any element of the page and then reference that in your ask of, "Here's what I want changed." I didn't know that was a feature. And that is extremely cool.

(00:48:57):
So interestingly, so having just looked at Lovable and Bolt and Replit and apps like that, it's basically doing all the things those apps do. Oh, wow. There's the retro version. That's good. I like that it built on your red and made it really nice actually.

Varun Mohan (00:49:11):
Actually the red looks way better now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):
Yeah, a little green button. This is great. Okay.

Varun Mohan (00:49:14):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
So I don't think people realize this, but apps like Windsurf, that it could actually do a lot of agentic work for you where you just tell it, "Here. I want you to do this" versus it's auto completing code for you.

(00:49:25):
The big difference is you need to start it with some code base so you have this kind of boilerplate React project. Is there a reason you guys aren't taking that step and just doing that automatically for you? Is it because you're targeting engineers and they don't need that or is there other reasons?

Varun Mohan (00:49:39):
Lenny, the interesting thing is the base app that you saw for this was also generated by Windsurf. The reason why we sort of didn't generate it is installing all the dependencies takes like three or four minutes. And for the demo, I didn't want to wait. But totally, actually most of the users of the product, probably zero-to-one build these apps.

(00:49:57):
And if I can say one interesting thing is, when we launched Windsurf, actually we tasked everyone at our company to go out and build an app with Windsurf. That included our go-to market team and our sales team. There was a crazy stat that I think people would find surprising, but we've saved over half a million dollars of SaaS products we were going to buy because our go-to-market team has now built apps instead of buying them. Our head of partnerships, instead of buying a partner portal product, has actually built its own partner portal. He had never built software in the past. We've actually come up with ways inside the company to deploy these apps easily in a secure way. And we're actually now building very, very custom software for our company to operate more efficiently, which is, I would not have expected this probably six months ago.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:44):
That is incredibly interesting. You don't need to name company names, but I guess what's a space you're least bullish on that you think is going to have the most problem here with people building their own version of these sorts of products?

Varun Mohan (00:50:56):
I think maybe my viewpoint are these very, very verticalized niche products I think are going to get... They're going to get competed down a ton. And I think sales products are an example of one of these things. And maybe this is a... I don't want to be very negative, but it's very hard inside a company like ours to task our best engineers to build a best in class sales product. There's not enough interest to do that. Or to build a best in class legal software product or finance software product. It's very, very hard for us to. And actually that's a very big moat for these companies that built these products that they were able to come out, have an opinionated stance on how to do this, hire good enough engineers to go out and build the software. Our company is unwilling to do that. So previously, we would go out and buy the technology because there would be no alternative.

(00:51:48):
But now one of the crazy things is that the domain specialists now have access to build the tools that they ultimately wanted, which is actually crazy. If you think about why were these software companies able to exist these vertical software companies, the reason is because they had many features. The kitchen sink of features worked for a lot of companies, but each individual company only wanted 10% of the features. But the problem is, each individual company was not capable of maintaining a piece of software or building the custom piece of software for 10% of the features, but that has now changed entirely. Now they can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:22):
Yeah. There's always been a story of like, "Why would I spend any time building my own software if I could just..." But now it's like five minutes of time.

Varun Mohan (00:52:29):
Five minutes and maybe even more custom to your system. How many times have you bought a software and you're almost like, "Why is there no integration to X? And I actually use X." How annoying is that? That actually makes the software less useful to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):
So I think what's cool is when you go back, if someone zooms back to the beginning of when you started the demo, it's basically a PM talking to an engineer, "Hey, build me a Airbnb for dogs. Here's a stupid mock that I made with some boxes." That's almost like a bad PM talking to an engineer and it just actually works. That's what's insane about this. And so that's why this example you're sharing of go-to-market folks, building their own things, it's like they don't need to know anything about product building. It's just describe it in some ridiculous way and draw a couple boxes of what you want it to look like and it makes something for you.

Varun Mohan (00:53:20):
Which shows that agency is what matters. If you have a product manager that has an idea, there's no reason for why that idea cannot be more well fleshed out. How many times do you have a product manager that just continualize ideas, but it just feels like they are extremely unsure on how to execute on it? They just want to say things for sake of saying things? But for the people that have ideas and a lot of, I guess, agency, they can go out and prove out what they want without any sort of external resources.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):
I think even more acutely for product folks listening to this, it's the salesperson coming to you being like, "Hey, I want this thing. It's going to help me with my sales team." And you're like, "I don't have a million things to build. I don't have time for this." And so that problem goes away, which I think will make a lot of product leaders really happy.

(00:54:04):
The model that this is sitting on, is it Sonnet?

Varun Mohan (00:54:08):
Yeah. So just to break down how it ultimately works, we have a model that does planning. And I would say right now Sonnet is a really, really good planning model. I think OpenAI's GPT-4o is also good. But the crazy thing is what we try to do is we try to make the Anthropic based model or Sonnet model try to do as much of the high level planning as possible. And then what we try to do internally is run all the models necessary to do high quality retrieval for the agent. As you could see, the agent needed to understand what the rest of the code base ultimately did. We actually make sure we run models to actually chunk up the entire code base and understand the code base so that obviously it would not be a good idea if we had a 100 million line code base to send that entire code base to Anthropic.

(00:54:49):
First of all, you couldn't do that. That's over 1.5 billion tokens of code. So obviously that would be three or four orders of my actually larger than the largest context lens right now.

(00:54:58):
But you also wouldn't want to do that from a cost and latency standpoint too. So that's one. And the second piece that you saw was the model is able to very quickly make edits to the software as well. We have custom models that we built that are post trained on top of popular open source models that can make these edits really, really quickly to the code base. And the reason why you would want to do that is it's A, faster, and B, also that model can actually have more of the code base in context too. So it can be better at applying changes than even Anthropics model too.

(00:55:28):
So I think the way we like to think about it is, our only goal is how do we build the best product possible? How do we build the best product possible and how do we make the ceiling as high as possible? And we will go out and build models and train models wherever necessary. But if we're not going to be good at a task and we think the open source is better or Anthropic's better, we'll go and just use the open source or Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):
And so the models you guys are building, those are built on open source models that people are releasing?

Varun Mohan (00:55:51):
Yeah. Interestingly, the one that does retrieval is actually completely pre-trained in-house that actually does that. But yeah, for a lot of different pieces, it's based on open source. Interestingly for the one that does the edits and auto-complete, that is also in-house. As you're typing, we actually do some auto-complete related stuff. I'm happy to show that, but I think a lot of users are familiar with that capability. So I think the way we like to look at it is like, what could we be best at and we will go out and trade. But if we're not going to be best at it, we should not just, for the sake of ego, go out and trade something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):
This may be getting too technical, but just, is there anything interesting around what you train on?

Varun Mohan (00:56:27):
Yeah, so one of the interesting things that we have from our users, and this is where we try to think like, "Why would we be any better?" is that, actually every hour, we get probably tens of millions of pieces of feedback from our users. We get a lot of feedback on what they like and what they don't like. For something like autocomplete, we get a lot of preference data, a lot of preference data. And the preference data is weird. It doesn't look like data that you find on the internet. It's like data as the user is typing. Imagine you're typing some code in a code base, the code's going to be incomplete as you're typing it, right? It's not going to be in a full-fledged form. It's not like it is on GitHub. But we have a lot of data that looks like this.

(00:57:06):
So we are uniquely well-positioned to actually build a good model that can complete code even when it's in an incomplete state when the models that are out there, the frontier models have consumed very little code that looks like this. So for that case we're like, "Hey, we can go out and do a much better job potentially." And we'll go out and train models on all the preference data we have.

(00:57:25):
The same is kind of true on retrieval, right? There's a way to find out, are we retrieving the right data? Did the user accept the code change after that? Was the retrieval actually a good retrieval a signal that we can get? So basically the way we like to look at it is, if something is just purely code planning, there's not a great reason why we would be the best at that. I can't come up with a coherent argument for that. But for something that looks more along the lines of, "Hey, here's an intermediate code base that is very gnarly and here are some changes that need to get made" and we know the evolution of the code or we've seen the evolution of code across millions of users, we feel like we can do a great job of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):
I think what's interesting about this is another differentiator/moat for companies that end up winning in this space, is you just have more and more of that data than other companies if you're ahead.

Varun Mohan (00:58:14):
Yeah. This is sort of why maybe at a high level we like the zero-to-one app building product space. I think it's really... It's a good product space. But ultimately I think it needs to boil down to you understanding the code, because otherwise, you're living at too high a plane where it's not clear why you would be able to be the best at that compared to everyone else. It's not really clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:35):
As a company, you mean?

Varun Mohan (00:58:36):
As a company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:36):
Versus as a user.

Varun Mohan (00:58:37):
It feels like it might get competitive in a way that it's not clear where you would continue to differentiate over and over with time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
I see. Because if they're just sitting on top of Sonnet and just doing what every other Sonnet wrapper is doing, there's not a lot of differentiation or moat.

Varun Mohan (00:58:54):
It depends on how you do it. But maybe if I was to say this, if the inputs you're consuming are just web elements, extremely high level web elements, then the interface might be high level enough that it's hard to maybe get better than maybe what the frontier models are doing just across the board. You are just better off just plugging in Sonnet for everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
Got it. Awesome. One thing I wanted to come back to that I wrote down that I think is really important for people to understand, you talked about how with Windsurf it's not necessarily... There's a boilerplate code base that you want to start with because it's actually... Because it's not an abstracted zero-to-one app builder. It's an actual IDE you're coding in. And you talked about how has to install dependencies, which is kind this painful thing. And the reason it has to do that is because running locally on your machine versus in the cloud, like, say, Lovable and Replit and all these guys, although I think Bolt runs in your browser in this really cool way.

(00:59:47):
So that's an important distinction. This is like you're running this locally in your machine and has all the libraries you need to actually run it.

Varun Mohan (00:59:54):
No, I think that's important. I think we believe a lot of people sort of build software in what are called code spaces and things in a remote machine. I just think it's that a lot of developers like building locally for what you said. Like if you're doing things that are more than just full stack applications, you might have dependencies on your machine that are just system dependencies that are just gnarly to install. Let's imagine you're building a GPU-based application and the Nvidia drivers, they're necessary. You just want to give people the flexibility to build where they can build. And I think the IDE and building locally has been a thing that people have done for decades, so probably it's not going to go away in the next couple of years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):
I love that your sales folks now are running local host servers.

Varun Mohan (01:00:34):
Well, with the browser previews, it's easier, right? You kind of just open it up on the side.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Okay. I have a few more questions just about how you think and operate at Codeium. So you guys are kind of at the forefront of how product teams are going to operate. You're seeing the future every day. And so I'm curious if there's ways you guys have structured your teams, engineers, product design that might be different from how other companies are doing it or have tried stuff that has worked really well or tried stuff that's a huge disaster?

Varun Mohan (01:01:02):
One interesting decision that we kind of have for core engineering is that we don't have pure product managers for the core engineering side of the company. And by the way, that's purely because we build for developers and our product is built by developers. So I think the intuition from our own developers is hopefully valuable. If not, we might be hiring the wrong type of people. So I think our developers are, in some sense, flexing to be more product conventional product managers.

(01:01:32):
Now on the other hand, if we were building something that looked more like Uber or the persona was very different and we didn't ourselves understand it, I think the organization wouldn't look the way it looks.

(01:01:42):
For the enterprise side of the company, because we do work with a lot of large enterprises where the requirements are not something that our engineers would automatically understand, I don't think our engineers wake up and they're like, "We need FedRAMP." This is probably something that a lot of customers come to us with and tell us. We have people that flex in this product strategy role that understand what the customer wants and understands the technical capabilities that we have to best build a product that would help them at scale.

(01:02:12):
So I think we have an interesting organization in this regard, but mostly I would say because we are a developer-based product, I would say that's true.

(01:02:21):
And then also kind of like what you said for the engineering team itself, the team structure is, it's fairly flat. We try to go with two pizza teams, teams that are fairly small just because I think the problem is when a team gets too big, the person leading the team is no longer able to get in the weeds of the technology itself. And I think in a space that's moving this quickly, I think it's dangerous to have leaders that don't understand the technology deeply and are not building. It's very, very dangerous because there's too much armchair quarterbacking. And so I think that's maybe one other decision we made.

(01:02:56):
And then teams are very, very flexible. So if we decide something is a new priority, we're very quick to change the way a team looks. And it's very centrally planned in this regard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:08):
The two pizza team concept, I saw a tweet long ago where someone from India, was like, there's always talk about two pizza teams, but pizzas in India are much smaller. And so the teams end up being smaller and they're like, "Why can't we build as much of these teams in the US?"

Varun Mohan (01:03:22):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:23):
Okay. So how many PMs do you have? So you said you have 150 employees, something like that?

Varun Mohan (01:03:28):
Yeah. So in terms of the product strategy function, we have three people in that role right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):
I see. So it's like product... They're in their titles is product strategy, not necessarily product management?

Varun Mohan (01:03:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
Interesting. And then 50 engineers, you said 80-ish sales folks?

Varun Mohan (01:03:45):
Yes, that's right. And then obviously we have functions like recruiting parts of G&A, like finance. We have marketing at the company. So some other functions internally as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):
It's interesting. And this is something that you hear all the time with companies like Dario for example, from Anthropic talking about how 90% of code is going to be written by AI. But all at the same time, all you guys are hiring engineers like crazy.

Varun Mohan (01:04:08):
Yeah. Is that contradictory?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):
It's that contradictory, will there be an inflection point of like, "All right. Now we don't need them anymore."

Varun Mohan (01:04:15):
I think it really comes down to, do you get incremental value by adding more engineers internally? I'm going to take... First of all, maybe just to set the record straight, if AI is writing over 90% of the code, that doesn't mean engineers are 10X as productive. Engineers spend more time than just writing code. The review code, test code, debug code, design code, deploy code, right? Navigate code. There's probably a lot of different things that engineers do. There's this one famous law in parallel computing, it's called Amdahl's Law. I don't know if you've heard about it. But it basically says if you have a graph of tasks and you have this critical path and you take any one task and parallelize it a ton, which is make it almost take zero amount of time, there's still a limit of the amount of how much faster it made the whole process go.

(01:04:56):
So maybe put simply, let's say you have 100 units of time and only 30 units of time is being spent writing software and I took the 30 and made it three, I only took the 100 and made it 73. It's only a 27% improvement in the grand scheme of things.

(01:05:09):
So I think look, we are definitely seeing over 30, maybe close to 40% productivity improvements. But I think for the vision that we're solving for, even if I were to say the company in the long tail had 200 engineers, it'd probably be too low still at that point. So the question is, how much more productivity do you get per person? Actually, maybe just to even say one of those thing for some of these large companies, let's say you took the CIO of a company like JPMorgan Chase, right? Her budget on software every year is $17 billion and there's over 50,000 engineers inside the company and you told her, "Hey, each of these engineers are now able to produce more technology." That's effectively what you've done, right? The right calculus that JPMorgan Chase or any of these companies will make is the ROI of building technology has actually gone up. So the opportunity cost of not investing more into technology has gone up, which means that you should just invest even more. And maybe in the short term you have even more engineers, right?

(01:06:08):
Now, that's not true across the board. There are some companies that are happy with the amount of technology they're building and there's a ceiling on the amount of technology they want to build. But for companies that actually have a very high technology ceiling, this doesn't mean you stop. This actually means you hire more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:22):
This is a great bull case for engineers. I feel like the canary in the coal mine for the engineering profession is when companies like yours slow down on hiring engineers.

Varun Mohan (01:06:30):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:31):
That's not happening.

Varun Mohan (01:06:32):
[inaudible 01:06:32]. It seems like Anthropic is also hiring a lot to get it done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:35):
Yeah. Everyone is. So I think that's really promising. I think if you're in college still, makes sense to get into engineering at this point.

(01:06:40):
Okay. Let me ask you this question as kind of a final question maybe. What's maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned about building AI products, building Windsurf and just being in a space?

Varun Mohan (01:06:54):
I think one of the weird things is online, everyone is very excited about the short-term wins that we are making, right? Like what we're putting out maybe weekly. We do these waves every couple of weeks. But actually a lot of the bets we're making inside the company are for things that are not three, four weeks, maybe three, six months, nine months away. That's what we're working on internally. Because I think this is kind of, Lenny, what I was mentioning to you before. One of the goals that I tell everyone at our company is we should be cannibalizing the existing state of our product every six to 12 months. Every six to 12 months, it should make our existing product look silly. It should almost make the form factor of our existing product look dumb.

(01:07:31):
So there's this weird tension where you want to have a product in market and you want to incrementally iterate and listen to users and keep making it better and better. But I would say we were the first identical IDE product out there. That's what we landed with. And I think the value of that is going to depreciate very quickly unless we continue to re-prove ourselves. And we will need to re-prove ourselves in ways in which our users are not even asking. So there's this tension here, where incremental feels very safe, right? Add this one more button. Users say, "Hey, I would like to be able to have this drop down to do X." But that is not the reason why we're going to win. That's almost table sticks. Yeah, we'll decide to do some of these. We might not decide to do a lot of these things. But it's these longer term efforts inside the company that almost disrupt the existing product that are ultimately the reason why we're going to succeed.

(01:08:21):
It's this weird tension that you need to have in your head of, you can't also not listen to your users at all because they're the reason you exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
This reminds me of a recent podcast guest. We had Gara from captions on the podcast and he told us that he has two roadmaps. They have two roadmaps at the company. They have the real roadmap, like the typical roadmap based on feature requests and user feedback and data and things like that. And then they have the secret roadmap, which is completely not informed by users or data/ it's just them making bets on where they think the world is going.

Varun Mohan (01:08:52):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
And I love that he calls it the secret roadmap just to make it very mysterious and-

Varun Mohan (01:08:56):
That's smarts. That's very smart.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:57):
Okay. I have one more question. I apologize. What's one thing that you wish he had known before starting Codeium?

Varun Mohan (01:09:04):
Honestly, I wish I had... Maybe humility is the wrong term, but this idea of just being okay with being wrong faster. I always think about things on when we make decisions. Me and my co-founder, we always talk about it. We're almost like, "Hey, I wish we had made the decision to do this a couple months earlier." We always talk about this. And the weird thing is outside looking and everyone's like, "Wow, actually the decision was made at the right time." But in my head I'm always banging my head being like, "What if we had made it a couple months earlier?" I think part of that is I waxed poetically about like, "Oh, you need to be irrationally optimistic and uncompromisingly realistic." But it's very hard to do this in practice because you drink your own Kool-Aid too. Because if you're not drinking your own, you won't get up out of bed. The answer is already solved. It's not actually any of these startups. The answer is Microsoft is going to be the winner in any software category. Isn't that the answer? Just because of distribution, resources and capital, they're going to commoditize every space.

(01:10:06):
So I think in some ways this amount of just understanding that, hey, re-evaluate your hypotheses and get into an uncomfortable space way more frequently is something I need to remind myself even to this day. And probably something that I didn't know coming in and starting the company. We started the company at peak zero time. At that time, probably everything seemed like it was going to moon. And there was probably a lot of irrational confidence, I would say, that we shouldn't have had.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Varun, we covered so much ground. What an incredible conversation. I learned so much just sitting here listening and asking you questions. Is there anything else that you wanted to share I leave listeners with, any last piece of nuggets or wisdom before I let you go?

Varun Mohan (01:10:51):
To be honest, I could give predictions about the space. Probably most of them are going to be wrong. I think the best thing to do is just get your hands dirty with all of these products. And I think one of the most obvious things that's going to happen is, in the next year, there will be a tremendous amount of alpha for anyone that is able to take maximum advantage of these tools. Just imagine how many of your coworkers just don't even know the existence of these tools, don't know what they can do and how much less productive they will be. And I would just say get your hands as dirty as possible, as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:24):
And when you say get your hands dirty, basically it's like download Windsurf, start coding. Ask it to build things for you.

Varun Mohan (01:11:29):
Yeah, build apps. Build apps. Start using it for maybe even making mocks, modifying your existing code base. There's probably ways in which you could be a force multiplier to your organization and ways in which they never even anticipated, right? Imagine if you were a product manager that could actually very quickly make edits to the code base and just start pushing changes yourself. You probably get a tremendous amount of respect from your own engineering peers. You could probably get way more done because of that. I feel like there's no sort of ceiling at that point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
I think this is such an underestimated point you're making here. There's apps that can build things from scratch and then there's apps like this that can edit your existing code base if you're a PM at... What's the largest company you work with, people-wise?

Varun Mohan (01:12:15):
Publicly, let's just say JPMorgan Chase.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:16):
Okay.

Varun Mohan (01:12:19):
They have over 50,000 developers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
Okay. So you could be a PM at JPMorgan Chase and be like, "I have a problem I need to solve. I want to move this metric. I want to change the step in the signup flow." You just open up Windsurf and tell it to do the thing you want. And then can you push straight to GitHub and do a-

Varun Mohan (01:12:37):
Yeah. Actually, you could do that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
... merge [inaudible 01:12:39]-

Varun Mohan (01:12:39):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Okay. PR?

Varun Mohan (01:12:40):
Yeah, it could make a PR for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):
Oh, my God. This is insane. Folks, future is out of control. Okay. Man, that was such an important point at the end there because I think people may not realize this. They see all these other apps, they're like, "Oh, [inaudible 01:12:51], prototypes," but this is legitimately something a PM can actually do work with.

Varun Mohan (01:12:55):
Yeah. When you think about the people, at least that, I don't know, Lenny, who you respect the most, they're the people that somehow, despite their title, their level of agency and just output just all the way down to the weeds to the highest level strategy is just perfection, right? They know when to go all the way down. And I think sometimes you see people that talk about roles and they irrationally feel like, "Oh, because I'm this role, I'm not allowed to touch this." Well now everything's open season, right? And I think this is an opportunity to almost go all the way down to the weeds and all the way up to the top and just be effective on every level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):
Unbelievable. All right. Well with that, we'll leave folks. Varun, thank you so much for being here.

Varun Mohan (01:13:35):
Awesome. Thanks a lot, Lenny.

## Transcript

Varun Parmar (00:00:00):
Every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you are either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Varun Parmar. Varun is chief product Officer at Miro, and prior to Miro, he was senior vice president and chief product officer at Box. As I share with Varun at the start of our chat, I've always been really curious about the product culture at Miro, partly because everyone I've ever met from Miro has been super interesting and super smart, and partly because they've been able to grow as a business and a product in an incredibly competitive market.

(00:01:07):
In our conversation, we get really deep into the product values and principles at Miro, their product development process, how Varun approaches competitive threats, how a bimonthly company-wide product demo ritual led to saving months of engineering work on a feature, plus insights into how Miro got started, how they grow today, and what their product team has learned about working with a large sales org. Varun is amazing, I learned a lot, and I hope you find it as interesting as I did. With that, I bring you Varun Parmar after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:39):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. While you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board.

(00:02:29):
With one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company and if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design and product for a fraction of the cost of agencies.

Varun Parmar (00:04:10):
Thank you, Lenny. So excited to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:13):
I'm really excited to have you here. I've been looking forward to having a chance to dig into Miro's product culture and the way Miro works for a while. We've actually had a few guests, ex-Miro... Mironeers, is that what you call yourselves?

Varun Parmar (00:04:25):
Yes, Mironeers.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Okay. Mironeers. So we had Elena Verna on the podcast, who's amazing, and Barbara who I think worked in marketing and everyone I've always met from Miro has been just really smart and really interesting and it just feels like you guys have a really interesting product culture that I haven't felt like has been shared a lot, and so I have a bunch of stuff I want to dig into there. One question I have at the bat, you guys have a really interesting history and specifically the way your company's structured, which is that you're collocated in Amsterdam and San Francisco. First of all, is that correct?

Varun Parmar (00:05:00):
The company is a global company, so we've got 12 different hubs. We have multiple offices in US, four different offices, and then multiple hubs in Europe as well, and presence in AsiaPac as well. I think by now we have a global footprint, yeah.

Lenny (00:05:17):
Got it. A question I wanted to ask off the bat is just how has that cross-cultural approach to product teams impacted the way that you guys built product and the way the company operates?

Varun Parmar (00:05:30):
The one thing that's really interesting, Lenny, around the way Miro is set up is that our product organization is actually based in Europe and our go-to-market organization is worldwide. Our product management team, our designers, our engineers are located across three different hubs in Europe. What that sort of leads to is a couple of practices that we have as part of our culture. The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers and figuring out what customer pain points and problems we can solve, but given our distributed nature in terms of having a global footprint and a lot of our go to market teams, folks in sales and marketing and customer success are in different continents or geographies, we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally. When we are interacting with folks, let's say in San Francisco, and those folks are out there meeting some of our large customers and stuff, how do we, in the product organization, understand their perspective, and bring that perspective into how we design, prioritize and build products? I think that's one thing that's unique.

(00:06:43):
I would say the other thing that's less to do with the location, but I think is sort of the core cultural value or philosophy that Andre, who's the founder and CEO has instilled in all of us, is practicing teamwork, how do we actually come together as a team, and bring down the silos that might exist across functions? I'll talk a little bit around how we are structured in the product organization so that it's a cross-functional perspective we bring to everything that we're doing because we believe the best work happens when we bring different diverse perspectives to the problem and then co-create the outcome that the customer is looking for.

Lenny (00:07:20):
I want to pull on these threads actually real quick. You talked about this value of empathy and the importance of having empathy across... because you guys are located in different locations and have different cultures, and also this idea of teamwork. What's something that you've done that helps you do that, either build empathy and maintain empathy across teams or make sure that people work in teams and not like, "Hey, there's this other team over there doing something else"?

Varun Parmar (00:07:45):
One of the most powerful things that I've seen work is the questions that you ask, the questions that you ask when you're going through product review or you are going to sit down and talk to someone and trying to understand why did they prioritize something over the other and was it something that was done through interactions they've had with folks internally or externally? I think it's the set of questions to ask in terms of how did they get to where they are today and was it informed by understanding of the insights that collectively the organization has? Was it informed by their understanding of where the market is evolving, where the competition is going.

(00:08:31):
Was it informed through the series of insights they have, either through inbound feedback that's coming through our different channels where customers are giving feedback or some outbound interactions that they've had? I think just trying to double click and getting to the details in terms of what insight led them to recommend certain things or make a left turn or a right turn is where I think is the most powerful way to make sure that those things are informed through practicing empathy internally and externally.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. There's this kind of cultural value of just assuming good intention and asking questions to understand where someone came from. I don't know if you'll have something off the top of your head, but is there a story or an example of that comes to mind where that was done well or not done well, I don't know, in something you recently were building?

Varun Parmar (00:09:16):
Maybe there are certain things, for example, anytime we're trying to build a new experience, one of the approach we want to take is very quickly validate that our original hypothesis, is that sound or not. We are big fans of the Design Sprint framework, what Jake Knapp has done I think is really amazing. In a short five-day window, you can get a small set of people to quickly mock up a concept, convert it into some sort of a prototype and then go out there and get some sort of a validation. Oftentimes when we are working on some of these new things, we have our product teams that are focused on zero to one initiatives, run this five-day initiative, and at the end of it we say, "Oh, this is great. Who did you get insight from?" There's a capability that we recently released, it's called Miro Talktrack, which essentially allows you to asynchronously do asynchronous collaboration by recording audio video on top of a Miro board.

(00:10:16):
We had two fundamental choices we could make. One, we could go down the path of what everyone's doing where you could do a screen recording and then spit out a series of videos, like pixels being captured. Or what we did was we actually went down a different path and the path that we went down was we basically synchronized the movement of the board. Let's say Lenny's presenting a board, some template he's created in terms of best practices for PMs, but he wants to have some sort of a talk track on top of it, an audio video feed. What we are doing is we're actually capturing the movement of the board that Lenny's going through along with the video talk track that's on top. The reason why we did that was because we had an insight that came through some of our interviews.

(00:10:56):
What our users want to do is they want to use Miro for collaboration. While communication is an important aspect of how teams come together, where we believe our sweet spot is that we want people to use Miro for collaboration. By making sure that they could actually use a video recording and while the video recording is playing, they could add in a sticky note, they could add in a comment, they could actually give a reaction. We were able to develop this insight by practicing empathy as part of the Design Sprint framework when we went and started to show our original concept and we walled and built on top of that.

Lenny (00:11:31):
That is a really cool story. That came out of this Sprint framework, these five-day sprint approach.

Varun Parmar (00:11:36):
Yes, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:37):
That is cool. I got to have that guy on this podcast. Jake Knapp, you said, right?

Varun Parmar (00:11:41):
Yes, yes, yes. I can text him right now and I can make the introductions, yes.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's pull him right into this podcast live, tell us how the Sprint process works. That is awesome. This connects a little bit to another question I wanted to ask around the top is, you guys are in a really competitive space and it feels like Miro was very early in online collaborative whiteboarding space and then I think during COVID it just became huge, with the remote work exploding. Like, "Holy shit, everyone needs this immediately." Over the years, many companies have come into the space that you are all in and it feels like Miro continues to do extremely well. I remember when Figma launched FigJam, there was a lot of just like, "Miro's dead. Figma's getting into the space, they're juggernaut, game over." Clearly that's not been the case and it just feels like, I don't know what it is internally that you all do that continues to allow you to compete and continue to innovate in the space. I'm curious just like is there something to how Miro approaches competition and also just, I don't know, the way they approach these sorts of challenges that is unique or interesting that you can share?

Varun Parmar (00:12:45):
If you look at the mission for Miro, we empower teams to create the next big thing and our focus is to enable teams that are innovating, and generally innovation happens at the intersection of a bunch of cross-functional folks coming together. Like we discussed, folks in product management or design or engineering or analytics or product marketing or research. What we find, Lenny, is that there are a lot of tools out there and those tools are generally sort of focused on a particular persona and maybe they're trying to solve the needs of a designer and a designer has a workflow that they're trying to do and they're using a specific tool and they sit at the adjacency of extending that core use case. The fundamental value that Miro provides is that we enable teams. I think what's unique about our product, and we can talk about the capabilities and roadmaps and use cases that we are investing in and we already have as part of the product, is that we take a team-centric lens.

(00:13:50):
So we're not saying, "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for designers," or "Hey, we're building a tool that just works for engineers." Because we fundamentally believe that innovation happens when cross-functional teams come together. When you look at the problem through that lens, you realize that you have to actually architect your solution. You have to think about the use cases and you have to go and prioritize certain experiences that are different and our customers see value in that, right? I think that's probably one sort of big macro aspect of how we think about our capabilities and products and why our customers think of us differently. I'd say that's say one point.

(00:14:27):
I think the second thing is Miro is actually used obviously by teams that are creating these innovative products and we actually have broad applicability across industries and verticals. While some tools might be hyper-focused on digital experiences and Miro's has great offerings there in terms of core capabilities, what we find is that Miro is used equally by companies in manufacturing, by companies in healthcare, by companies in architecture and engineering and construction functions, by companies that are in aerospace, governmental agencies and medical agencies and so on and so forth. I think the platform is actually much more agnostic in terms of its capabilities and what we offer that actually makes it more accessible and appealing to organizations that want to go beyond just digital experiences.

(00:15:26):
Then I would say finally there are capabilities that are available very, very uniquely to Miro that are valued by our users. That again is a big reason people come to Miro. For example, if Lenny's trying to conduct a big workshop with a bunch of product folks and he wants to facilitate that workshop and wants to have certain folks focus on one part of the board and while others focus on the other part, then there are some advanced capabilities that enable certain use cases like workshops. Or if you want to use Miro for some team rituals or from some agile practices, there are core set of capabilities that you could use the product for that are missing in some of the other capabilities. I would say a combination of all of those three things continue to drive differentiation. I would say on top of that, we are a big fan of our community and we believe that community love is what drives us. That's the fuel that keeps us going every single day.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Just to summarize and I was taking notes as you're chatting, just thinking about what allows you all to continue to do well in the market, considering all the competition constantly coming at you. One, as you mentioned, just there's kind of like a innate multi-functional architecture which is hard for someone to copy if they weren't built from that without the start. Two, it sounds like you are focusing on a wide spectrum of personas and it's not just tech employees basically. Also, just there's specific features that end up being really important that maybe people have a hard time building and then this last piece of the community. Awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:17:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:17:09):
Let's dig into the product team a little bit and understand how you all build product and structure product team. How many PMs are there at Miro? Then just broadly, how many employees, just to give people a set of, little bit of context?

Varun Parmar (00:17:20):
Give or take about 1,800 employees at Miro globally across all of the 12 hubs, and specifically in terms of the number of product managers, there are over 450 PMs in the team.

Lenny (00:17:34):
Then how's the product team structured? Is it like outcome oriented? Is it product area oriented? Is it user persona oriented? Is it something else? How do you think about the structure of the product team?

Varun Parmar (00:17:46):
Yeah, so I would say it's maybe a hybrid structure that we have, but the foundation of the team setup is around persona. We have what we refer to as streams, some companies refer to as domains, but essentially it's a set of individuals that are focused on solving the problems for a key persona. Just to give you an example, we have a stream that's focused on enterprise, and in enterprise we are looking at the IT admin persona, we're looking at the security persona or the compliance persona. There are a set of folks who are creating a roadmap and innovating for that audience. There's another stream which is called platform where we are going after the developer install base, folks that want to use Miro as a platform and build apps that they can actually make available either on the marketplace for everyone to use or they could be developers that are inside of a large organization and they're trying to integrate Miro with their specific use cases and workflows and business systems. That's another sort of stream that's focused on that, and there are a couple of other streams like that.

(00:18:53):
Then finally there are some just horizontal sort of streams, if you will. We have a big focus given that we are a PLG-led company around growth and self-serve business. We've got a stream that's actually focused on our core internal infrastructure. We've got a stream that's actually focused on data science that's doing all of the magic that we started to release in terms of Miro AI, et cetera, et cetera. I would say it's a combination of those. At the heart of it is we are focused on personas and we are sort of aligning people around solving problems and creating value for that persona.

Lenny (00:19:24):
That is really interesting. One of the downsides of a persona-based approach I imagine is that features keep getting added that solve that user's pain points. What have you learned about keeping the product consistent and having a holistic perspective on the experience? How do you address Those challenges?

Varun Parmar (00:19:43):
Architecturally, there are two sort of things that we have done that allow us to not pigeonhole ourselves into that specific way of working. I completely agree with you, you could lead to that. The first one is actually when we think about the product org, we call our org, it's called AMPED, A-M-P-E-D. This is actually going back to our earlier point, Lenny, we had around what's unique about the product culture, what's unique about Miro, and we talked about teams coming together, removing barriers or silos cross-functionally. AMPED stands for analytics, marketing, product, engineering and design. And everything that we do in the product org, when we say the product org, we actually don't meet product managers. We actually don't mean product managers, designers and engineers. What we mean by product org in Miro is this AMPED function. By having this cross-functional representation where product marketing team is deeply, deeply embedded inside of each of these streams, what we do is that we have different perspectives that come in where they say, "Oh, wait a second, did you think about the end user experience?"

(00:20:49):
If you think about the end user experience, you know have someone on the team that says, "Wait a second, did you actually think about the enterprise requirements or what's needed in the largest corporation?" I think the unique setup of bringing these cross-functional folks allows us to sort of course correct. The second thing is the ways of working that we have. We have these product reviews that happen. We generally classify anything that we are doing in terms of its complexity around a small, medium or high complexity, and anything that's being worked on is actually being shared with the entire organization. If it's something that's small to medium, it's actually shared with the entire product org. In fact, if you are non-product, you can actually subscribe to that Slack channel as well. Everybody sees what the product org is working on, everybody sees what the core hypothesis is, "What is the solution for that, what is the proposed design for it, how are we thinking about the capabilities?"

(00:21:49):
Then anything that's big actually goes through a formal process like a product review where there's a meeting and a bunch of us are in there and it's up to us, including the product leaders, to basically make sure that we are connecting the dots in terms of having a much more holistic perspective. I would say lastly, as Miro has sort of scaled the spectrum of companies all the way from a team that might have two or three people and might be taking out their credit card and using Miro for their own team all the way to a large corporation that might have 50,000, 80,000 employees, all of them are using Miro. We've come to realize that at some point the deep enterprise requirements need to be encapsulated in a set of requirements or best practices and we need to make sure that those get democratized across all of the feature teams.

(00:22:36):
When I'm thinking about building a new feature, I have a checklist in front of me where I can say, "Here are the 10 things that I need to think of that I need to incorporate early on in my thinking in the architecture, in the definition of the process, so that it doesn't come downstream." I would say that's an area where we're still working on and more recently we put more focus and energy and there's a product manager who's now leading that particular charter.

Lenny (00:22:57):
I love all these details. This AMPED structure, I love that. There's analytics, you said product marketing, analyst marketing and then product engineering design. It's rare that you see marketing as a part of teams, as a leadership, kind of part of the leadership group. Do you have a sense of what impact adding that had on the team or where that came from? Or is that just historically been something Miro has prioritized, marketing and product marketing?

Varun Parmar (00:23:25):
This was done before I got here and I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't. I think this was the result of an observation, which is quite similar to what you're saying, which is while we might be developing a lot of the features and PMs or thinking bottoms-up in terms of what we are building, we might find that what we have built might not be able to capture the imagination of what we originally thought it would. A big part of that is how are you going to think about positioning, how are you going to think about competitive differentiation? How are you going to package it up so that the sellers that are out there are able to position it in a way that the customer, in this case the buyer, might be an IT professional, might a line business leader, can basically see the full vision of where we are going? I think by having product marketing as part of AMPED, we now bring that unique perspective that may be missing in certain teams.

(00:24:24):
PMs are more acting as product owners or more focused on core problem and solution but not thinking about positioning, because that's so important, especially when you're thinking about a market that we are increasingly in that there is competition there. That's one of the first things we started off with and that's top of mind for you as well, is that everything that we are doing has to be looked through that lens. One of the core philosophies that I have, Lenny, is that the success of a company is a direct relation of what the competition allows you to do. I feel like not many people talk about that, but in many cases in my professional career, and I've been at it for close to 24, 25 years, is that every single instance when I looked at a company accelerated their growth or there was a deceleration of growth, it was a direct relation to what the competition allowed you to do. Obviously, you have to do everything that you should be doing, but competition is the biggest variable that allows you to figure that out.

Lenny (00:25:24):
I want to hear more about your core product philosophies, but let me dig into the one you just shared. What you find is that the way you grow or stop growing is often a direct result of your competition. Is there an example of that that comes to mind? I'm guessing maybe Box versus Dropbox is an experience you had there, or if not, what's an example of that that you've experienced, to make it a little more concrete even?

Varun Parmar (00:25:50):
For those of us who've been in the collaboration space, and I've been doing collaboration and productivity apps for over 20 years, over two decades, at some point, you have companies like Microsoft that get really attracted to a space and you can see the trajectory of a business that's growing at a certain clip and then all of a sudden there's a competitive product that enters that has the might of distribution and the might of pricing, and that's just a direct example. I think I've seen that multiple times, first at Adobe where I was part of the document cloud business, clearly saw that at Box as well.

(00:26:27):
I think you can, in general, sort of look at every single category and you can say that there was a category leader and they were growing at a certain clip or a certain pace and all of a sudden there were a bunch of entrants that get in and what happens to your growth rate? It's all dependent on how strong is the competitor in terms of providing a good enough solution? That's one. The second is how strong is the competition in terms of their distribution outreach? Then the third thing is how strong is the competition in terms of the pricing and packaging?

Lenny (00:26:55):
I really like this discussion, especially because often the advice is, "Don't worry about the competition, just focus on the customer, it's going to be fine." Which what you're saying is that's not right, and I agree. What do you do with that in mind? How does that impact the way you build product or strategy? Is there some you could share that maybe tactically someone could leverage to how they're approaching their product strategy?

Varun Parmar (00:27:18):
It depends on who the competition is and what is their unfair advantage here. We talked about one specific competitor and I have a lot of respect for them, by the way, and I learn a lot from them every single day in terms of how they make bets and how they enter markets and stuff. At some point I'm going to write a book on them, I feel.

Lenny (00:27:35):
Ooh. We'll have to come back to talk about that.

Varun Parmar (00:27:38):
That's right, yeah. I think it sort of comes down to how do you think about your unique place relative to all of these players, and in your customer's mind are they able to clearly understand what is the unique value that you deliver relative to everything else? Part of that is the unique capabilities you provide. Part of that is how you're packaging those unique capabilities to them, and making sure that they in their mind can see how you coexist in this overall sort of tech ecosystem that they might be investing in, to enable their employees or to enable them to operate. So I think it's sort of looking at that from that lens, yeah.

Lenny (00:28:26):
Got it. So what I'm hearing is be very clear about your differentiator and continue to invest there and then make sure your positioning is clear around why you're... just identifying, "Here's why we're different and we're not just a better or worse version of this thing" or "Here's why we're different" and making sure that's really clear.

Varun Parmar (00:28:43):
Exactly. I think the other thing I would say, there's another core philosophy I have, which is products either get better over a period of time or they get worse. Products never remain the same. I think you can take that philosophy to a bunch of things in life, but I'm going to take the lens of products, which is my core philosophy is every single day, every single time somebody is pushing your code to production and you're releasing a feature or an enhancement, you are making the product better or you're making the product worse, but the products never remain same. The lens for this, Lenny, is actually from a customer's perspective, from the end user perspective. The thing is that if you are a player where there's no one else in the market, that's one thing, so that's great. Kudos to you for actually identifying a blue ocean strategy and sort of executing to that. But most markets, most products, actually have either direct or indirect competitors that are available.

(00:29:40):
From the customer's mind, you're doing something, the competitor is doing something, so in their mind they're looking at these products and they're looking at these companies and they're saying, "Which is better versus not?" So with every release that your competitor is making and every release that you're making, you're either making chess points, moves against them, positive points, or you're going negative. I think that framework, if you have in mind, it actually drives an insane amount of clarity in terms of what you're doing and what the impact is going to be. Because every single move that you're making, the customer has that sort of in their mind, if not explicitly, implicitly that they're actually comparing these things. I think it brings a level of focus in terms of where you need to invest and why you need to invest and why this is going to make those decisions.

(00:30:28):
I think it allows at least for product leaders to make some high quality decisions around the bets that they're making and how they're going to play out in terms of eventual once the dust settles and the market at large is going to say, "I'm going to standardize on something and now I feel I need to go get it for everyone." Or "This is the tool that I want to use for this particular use case." That all of these decisions that you are making ladder up to that final sort of play that you have to do in terms of the market consolidation that eventually happens.

Lenny (00:30:59):
This is so interesting. Essentially what you're saying is that you find that being very close to and understanding the competition really well is really essential, versus this kind of the other end of the spectrum almost from just like, "Don't worry about the competition, don't pay attention." I like this point, metaphor of just like, "Are we moving ahead or further behind?" Is that where you operationalize that to track that? Then also just how do you not over-obsess with, "Let's just catch up, get more features," that kind of thing? How do you find that balance?

Varun Parmar (00:31:28):
I'll be honest, I don't think we've figured it out. We haven't cracked the nut in terms of how to operationalize this, but I know you are way smarter than me on some of these things, so maybe we can-

Lenny (00:31:39):
Unlikely.

Varun Parmar (00:31:39):
... partner on this and come up with something.

Lenny (00:31:43):
All right, that'll be something we work on. Any other product philosophies that you want to share? That was awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:31:52):
This is all sort of related to it. It's like a string of pearls. I think there's maybe one more pearl we can actually thread into the needle right here.

Lenny (00:31:59):
Let's do it.

Varun Parmar (00:32:00):
Which is we talked about how do you ladder this up and stuff, and then the question is, okay, how do you know that everything that you're doing, is that in the right direction or not? Should you move slow and be much more mindful about the things that you're doing or should you move fast and make certain bets and then decide certain things and stuff? I think there are two views that are out there. My personal perspective on this is that what you want to do is that you want to be the first one to hit the brick wall. This is particularly true when you are in a market that is competitive. The reason for that is that if you consider yourself as an innovation-centric company and you believe that you are building experiences that fundamentally don't exist anywhere else and you're sort of paving the way for the rest of the folks to basically get inspired with how you are building these experiences, speed is the single biggest determinant, in my experience, in terms of who ends up being more successful versus not.

(00:33:14):
I don't know, maybe this is a little bit controversial where people say, Go slow to actually go fast." I think I have a lot of respect for that and there's certain areas you should do that, but when you are trying to figure out new experiences and stuff and you don't know if it's going to resonate or not, speed is something that you should accelerate for the organization. I think Frank Slootman talks about this a lot in his book and how can you accelerate? I think for me from a product perspective, the fundamental concept is can you be the first one to hit the brick wall where you have the learning faster than anyone else in the market so that you can decide, "Oh my god, the path that I was going was not the right path. I need to do 10 degrees west or I need to do 30 degrees east." I think as long as you're one or two or three steps ahead of everyone else in terms of uncovering or discovering those insights, then I think you can continue to be ahead of the pack in terms of building your product in business.

Lenny (00:34:21):
You're talking about urgency. I've never met a founder or a product leader who doesn't want their team to move faster. They're always encouraging their team, "How do we move faster?" I'm curious if there's something you've learned tactically about helping your team move more quickly. You mentioned Frank Slootman's book. Amp It Up is what it's called, by the way, in case folks want to check it out and he's big on just like creating a sense of urgency, constant urgency, and we'll link to that and share notes. But yeah, what have you found helps create urgency and generally helps your teams move faster other than just like, "Move faster, everyone"?

Varun Parmar (00:34:52):
My fundamental belief here, Lenny, is that every product manager... I can talk to product managers because there is reason certain ones, someone wants to be a product manager, because in my view it's one of the most thankless jobs, like you get to do a lot of [inaudible 00:35:10] and it's like, "Why you have to do this?" But it attracts a certain personality and that personality is driven by challenge and that personality wants to prove that they can solve this challenge and do something amazing. I think fundamentally the product persona actually wants to move fast. I think the reason why in some cases we are not able to move fast is because of roadblocks that we run into and those roadblocks can manifest themselves into technical challenges, they can manifest them in cells of organizational challenges, they could be priority challenges and so on and so forth.

(00:35:52):
My fundamental approach to solving that is to ensure that the product leads who are working on these capabilities can instantly raise their hand and call out that there are challenges that they are running into. Then the job of the leadership team, the product management team, is to essentially go and quickly resolve those issues. I think if you are able to resolve those issues, then what it does is it actually starts a virtuous cycle where you can actually start to see those wins. Once you see those wins, you actually create that courage to do more things. Maybe because you've seen how that specific roadblock was solved and you have a pattern matching that you've developed now, you can solve a lot of those things on your own and it's the next level of challenge that you now going to raise your hand.

(00:36:41):
What that does is it starts to build this organizational competency in terms of how you can figure out what to build. We all find these people in our organizations where there's someone somehow is able to do certain things in one-tenth the time that it would take a normal person. It's not that they are 10 times faster, it's just that in my observation that they've figured out which part of the core base they should build in versus not, who should be part of their team and who should not be, how they need to define that from a scope perspective, what does success look like, and it's the architecture of bringing all of these things together that actually brings that magic formula line in terms of "Hey, we are able to deliver faster."

Lenny (00:37:19):
I really like this topic. What I'm hearing is one of the biggest roots of slowdown in a company and product development is blockers not being unblocked, and I always feel the same thing. I feel like a PM's number one job is to unblock their team because their job is basically make the most out of their team that they're marshaling towards some outcome. The way you do that is just figure out what's slowing them down. You just talked about this idea of a PM raises their hand to leadership, "Hey, we're blocked by this thing." Is there a process you've come up with there that helps you do that, it's connected to-

Varun Parmar (00:37:51):
Yeah, I would say we are trying to sort of systematically ingrain this in the culture of the organization. We have a motto in the product org, it's very simple, single sentence, deliver customer value faster with high quality. That's it. Everything that we do, and when I say everything, everything, Lenny, from performance and reward system and measurements, everything is based on this one single statement and it has three attributes. The first one is deliver customer value, and we believe customer value is only delivered when customers use it. Anytime as a PM at Miro, when you ship something, we are looking at, "Well, what was the metric you were going to move and how much did it move?" We have some original targets that we can go back to. That's the first aspect of what we're doing, deliver customer value.

(00:38:35):
The second one is move faster, and there are certain cycle times that we are measuring across the organization. From the time you came up with the idea to the time that you actually pitched a solution to the time you actually shipped it, to the time we actually moved the metric, it's information that has been collected and is being made available to the organization. You can say, "Hey, if it was a small, medium or large, what's the average? What's the medium, what's the variance?" And you can say, "Hey, looking at this data, what can be improved?" That's on the faster aspect of it. Then the last one is around high quality, which is we want to build best in class collaboration experiences, so we are always getting inspired by what we find in applications and experiences that we see around us and we are saying, "Hey, when it comes to designing, sharing flows, we believe that these are the three apps that have best in class sharing flows when it comes to designing some synchronous capabilities like this. These are the best in class apps that we should look at."

(00:39:31):
We are always trying to make sure that we are benchmarking ourselves against that and we have our design team. On a regular basis, like when we ship stuff on a monthly basis, our design leadership team does a triage of everything that got shipped into high quality or not high quality. It's just like a binary function, and we're doing that and we're saying, "Hey, the reason why we believe it's not high quality is because A, B, C, D, E and we're making it available to other designers so they can actually start to build that telemetry in terms of some things are more subjective." But you can start to see some patent matching and say like, "Hey, this is what great looks like."

Lenny (00:40:06):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress, and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large established companies such as Vercel, Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using linear as magical.

(00:41:15):
Okay, so every month or so the design team looks at everything that's shipped and puts things into a bucket. Either this is... It's like a binary thing, high quality or not high quality.

Varun Parmar (00:41:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:41:24):
Wow, that is so cool. Then, one, what do they do with that? Do they send it out to the product team? Then two, is this just like FYI or is it like, "We need to fix all these low quality things going back"? Or is it more just like, "For the future, please be aware these are not high quality"?

Varun Parmar (00:41:39):
Yeah, so it's actually both. Generally what happens is that the design leadership team is doing this and there's one particular design leader who's the designated person to make sure that this is happening on a regular basis. Right now the way we're using it is that we are actually using it to calibrate and align around the design leadership around what we mean by high quality. Because it's one of those things, it's like if you've never seen colors and I ask you, "Lenny, describe pink and compare that to red," and if you haven't seen colors, how do you describe colors? You can't. But if I show you and I say, "Lenny, these are three examples of what pink is and these are three examples of red is," then you're like, "Oh, I get pink and I get red." There are certain things that you just like when you write it's very, very hard to describe it, but if you show specific examples, it's very clear, "Oh, I get it. I get how pink is different than red." But if I try to describe it, it's going to be very hard.

(00:42:35):
So we got into these endless conversations at some point about a year ago where we were saying, "We need high quality, we need high quality." And people are like, "Let's just go and define this thing." We had a bunch of our leaders go and write documents, really long documents in terms of what are the attributes and how do we define those attributes and how do we measure those attributes and how do we enable people to do that? It felt like it's a good thing because we are trying to codify it, but it also felt like it was a very heavy way of solving that problem. Then we just came up with this approach, which is like, "What's great versus not great" and just start classifying it. As you know, it's like modern AI systems are classification systems and we [inaudible 00:43:12]-

Lenny (00:43:12):
Yeah, I was going to say, sounds like reinforcement learning approach here.

Varun Parmar (00:43:14):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:43:14):
Defining cost.

Varun Parmar (00:43:15):
That's right. That's right. I think it's worked decently well. I would say with most things we need to operationalize it and we need to make sure that now we are democratizing it and everybody has access to it and so on and so forth. But I think it's been a good start and now we are sharing this more openly with others in the org.

Lenny (00:43:37):
When I said that, I imagined you... From the outside, you have a very unique culture and approach your product. That's a great example of that. I've never heard of a process like this. What I'm hearing is essentially you're trying to build the muscle within the organization of what is quality. It's like this continued heuristic of, "Okay, I get it." So PMs on the team start to understand in their head what that means.

Varun Parmar (00:43:56):
Right.

Lenny (00:43:57):
Super cool. You also talked about, in the middle part of that sentence, of moving faster and that you track and measure that somehow. Can you talk more about that? Because that's something every product team is always trying to understand. "How do we know if we're going faster, if we're going as fast as we could?" How do you actually do that? How do you measure these things?

Varun Parmar (00:44:13):
The core philosophy there is velocity is more like the game of golf where you're just playing against yourself. It's not like if Lenny and Varun are out at the golf course, it doesn't matter. I'm not competing against you, I'm just competing against myself because that's the only... I'm going to just hit the ball, so it's like how much better can we get? I think our core philosophies around that and what we're trying to do is that on all the product teams, the feature teams that we have, we're just collecting all the information and we are making it available to everyone so that they can actually see what the cycle times are. What we are interested in is from the time that you have an insight, from the time you believe "I can do something unique for my user, for my persona," how long does it take for you to actually deliver that value?

(00:45:04):
We have a product process that we follow, which starts with a P-strat, which is a strategy, and then we go into P0, which is definition of the problem, then we go into P1, which is definition of the solution, and then we go into P2, which is once the solution is shipped, are we hitting the metrics that we originally had defined upfront before we decided to work on this. You have all of these stage gates and then we basically classify everything that we are doing in small, medium, large. You can go in and you can say, "Hey, I thought this was a small thing," and small thing is something you can get it done in less than a month, and so on and so forth. There are 50 other product teams that are shipping these features, and what's the average, what's the variance, what's the median?

(00:45:48):
"Oh, wait a second, actually it seems like I took way more time in the problem definition stage. Let me actually try to go talk to this other product team that actually did it much faster," or "Oh, I actually did it really, really fast, and the reason why I did it fast was because of this. Let me go share this out with the broader team." Usually the product ops function, we call it product excellence internal, sort of product excellence function, is recording some of these things. I would say getting reliable data, and then because we have some things that are going through meetings and there are some things that are going through Slack, we could do better on some of those dimensions, but all of this data is available and we provided it openly and folks can benchmark themselves against that.

Lenny (00:46:34):
So cool. Okay, so you have this P-strat, you called it, document which is kind an initial concept and then it's interesting you use the P0, P1, which is often for bugs, but it's cool that you use it for defining your products. So P-strat is just an idea pitch. P0 is a spec, basically, like a one-pager for the product, and then P1 and P2 are basically getting to "Here's the actual product we're building." And you basically track time per step and map it to, "Here's how large this project should be." Over time you track per person, it sounds like, just like are you matching the benchmarks of how long a small project should take across each step?

Varun Parmar (00:47:13):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:47:14):
Wow, that is extremely cool. Whatever templates you can share, these things that we can include in the show notes would be awesome.

Varun Parmar (00:47:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:22):
Because people are always looking for just like, "Ah, I want do some of this stuff." If they can just plug and play, the more, the merrier.

Varun Parmar (00:47:28):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:29):
Shifting a little bit, it sounds like you guys are doing Scrum in some form. Can you just talk about just broadly the product development process? How long you or your sprints, how long do you plan for in the future, in detail specifically just like high level, how does the product development process work?

Varun Parmar (00:47:43):
There are certain things that I learned at Box and that inspired some things that we do at Miro, and there are certain things that we've evolved. One of the things that we've instituted is our roadmap process, so that's sort of the first thing around how the different teams are looking at the things that they're going to work on. We have a rolling six month roadmap, it seems large, but we've got, like I mentioned, a number of enterprise customers. If I've learned one thing that large enterprises is asking for a roadmap review. That tends to be my favorite meeting of sitting down with the enterprise leaders and walking through what we are working on. What we've done is we've tried to architect something which actually allows our customers to get what they're looking for, but at the same time does not remove the agility that is so important for us to deliver value faster.

(00:48:41):
What we do is we have a rolling six month roadmap that gets updated every three months and the first three months of that roadmap, we have a 80% position level, which means that 80% of the things that we claim to be on the roadmap will get done. That's the target. For the next three months, because it's six months, so the first three months is 80%, the next three months is 50%, so we have a much lower level of resolution in the next three months after that. What that allows the product teams to do is actually have flexibility, which is based on what the customers are asking for and based on what the competitive moves are, based on some technology breakthroughs that happen around large language models, they can pivot and they can pivot and move towards that and they won't get penalized either by the customer or internally in terms of doing that. That's what we do and that's all at on the backdrop of an annual strategy that we publish.

(00:49:34):
Every year we publish a strategy white paper that it gets published internally available to every single Mironeer across all functions that clearly articulates the key bets that we want to make. Why do we want to make those bets? What is the expected outcome and how does that ladder up into the overall business outcomes that we are trying to drive from an OKR perspective as well as the overall business strategy that we have. So people take that product strategy, white paper or artifact, and then against that they're building their roadmaps which get updated every three months. Then inside of the teams, we enable teams to be quite autonomous in terms of some of the rituals that they're doing. We want them to obviously embrace best practices. We've got a team of agile coaches that share best practices or are available to help if there's certain specific needs that teams have.

(00:50:31):
Then I think on top of that, there are certain key, I would say, rituals that we do that maybe are unique. For example, we have something called as Miro Connect, which happens every other Friday. Every other Friday, for example, in our Amsterdam office, you can go in there and at 4:00 in the afternoon, 4:00 to 7:00 or 8:00, and sometimes it goes really late, you've got a bunch of product teams sitting around tables and it feels like, "Oh, it's like a pitch or something." And people are coming in, they're having a good time, you've got a drink in your hand, there's maybe some light music playing in the background and you're going from table to table and you have teams that are actually showing all the amazing work that... If done right, it happens once in a while, but if done right, it's magical in terms of the outcomes that you can get.

(00:51:20):
I'll tell you, there was a team that actually was presenting at our Berlin hub and they were saying, "We're working on this feature, and there's an engineer who walks over to that desk and says, 'What are you working on?'" The team describes it, "Oh, we are trying to do something like this." And this engineer had actually worked on that particular problem in their prior life, literally they had implemented this. So he says, "So how are you going to implement this?" And the team, the engineer that's sitting there, says, "This is the approach I'm going to take and it's going to take me three months." He's like, "Oh, would you mind if I go and help you with this?" They're like, "Sure, more the merrier. Go ahead." So this person puts down their beer and says, "Okay, I'm having a good time. Let me just head back to my home." And in the next three or four hours goes and codes the entire thing, makes a poll request.

(00:52:10):
Next day in the morning one of the engineers from this core team that was exhibiting at Miro Connect looks at the poll request, reviews the code and says, "Yes, something that would have taken three months for this core team because they didn't have the expertise literally got done in three hours because there was another engineer that ran into them and said, "I know how this is done. I can actually help you here," and went ahead and did the right thing. We are trying to create these magic moments. It happens once in a while, but we have one success story and I like to tell that in every opportunity that I get. But that's another sort of unique thing that we've done in terms of book-ending things around how we operate here.

Lenny (00:52:50):
That story is like a dream for any PM. Just imagine saving months of work with one conversation. I imagine people were like, "How do we replicate this often?" I love that. With these meetings, just to understand, if their team is in Berlin, let's say, there's a screen there in front of a table and they're talking through a screen, like a video conference?

Varun Parmar (00:53:12):
Yeah. I mean, right now what we've figured out is that it is really hard to do these events over audio-video conferencing and stuff. So generally what happens is that you have an audio-video bridge that's playing, but mostly it's people walking up to the respective teams and then having a live conversation. That's usually how these things are operated. Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Got it. Okay, so you have six month rolling roadmaps. You have a yearly vision strategy for the company, two week sprints. Is there also a quarterly OKR sort of process or is it-

Varun Parmar (00:53:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:48):
... those or not? There is, okay.

Varun Parmar (00:53:48):
There is, yeah.

Lenny (00:53:49):
Can you just talk a little bit about how that works?

Varun Parmar (00:53:51):
Yes, yes, yes. At Miro, we practice OKRs and it starts off at the company level, and then those company level OKRs are taken by the AMPED organization. Like we describe, it's the AMPED organization, and then we break it up and I would say we have refined it over the period of time, the two years that I've been at Miro. Early on we were doing OKRs on a quarterly basis, and I would say more recently we've actually evolved to six month KRs. What we found was that six month was the right cadence in terms of giving enough time for teams to basically push forward in executing these KRS and minimizing the "overhead" of doing replan every single quarter. We found that it was much more effective and efficient for the entire organization to do it on a six-month basis. However, we are doing traction on a monthly basis. So every four weeks, as AMPED, we are looking at our KRS for the AMPED organization on a monthly basis doing traction. However, the planning, the targets, are done on a six-month basis.

Lenny (00:55:06):
I love how OKRs could just be anything, could be every six months, could have objectives, could have key results. It's just such a term that just applies to anything that people do with goals, basically.

Varun Parmar (00:55:17):
That's true.

Lenny (00:55:18):
And it works. It's great.

Varun Parmar (00:55:19):
That is so true.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Again, if there's any templates that your team could share of the way you do that stuff, that would be amazing, and we'll include that in the show notes.

Varun Parmar (00:55:27):
Yeah, absolutely. Because I think, as you would expect, we run Miro on Miro, so there's a lot of things that we could share as templates in terms of how we are running things on Miro, not just as OKRs, but in terms of product reviews. We have ways of how we are doing asynchronous reviews combined with synchronous reviews and there's this blended experiences that we have, and so we can definitely share out with the community how we do some of these things.

Lenny (00:55:55):
Awesome. That's a great segue to another question I was going to ask is just what other tools, what's in the stack of the product team's workflow? So Miro, obviously. Maybe talk about what use Miro for, but then what else is in there? What do you use for task management, bug tracking, things like that? Design?

Varun Parmar (00:56:12):
Starting from the bottom-up infrastructure view, so all of our tickets are handled in Jira and we are using some of the newer capabilities in Jira in terms of coming up with roadmaps and coming up with the priorities and stuff. On top of that, all of the specs generally get recorded in Confluence. Having said that, we're actually a big fan of tools like Google Docs as well as Coda that allows us to track our KRs in a pretty effective way. On top of that, obviously we use Miro a lot, I would say for a lot of our things, especially on the product and design side of the team. Generally all of our insights get captured inside of Miro board, so when we are going and conducting user experience interviews and stuff, we will record those and then those recordings get added to a Miro board, so Miro access the content hub or a team hub for a particular project.

(00:57:20):
Once you capture all of those insights, then generally all of the brainstorming and team ideation happens on the Miro board as well, so Miro's actually also used as a tool to facilitate meetings and workshops. Once all of that is synthesized into a set of recommendations and outcomes, so when we go into these product reviews that we were talking about, Lenny, the same Miro board then gets manifested into a set of presentations, so we use Miro for presentations. We've actually made some really amazing updates in terms of our capabilities there and if folks haven't checked them out, I would strongly encourage them. There's a capability called Showtime that basically abstracts out the UI and lets people focus on the content, but do it in a way that it's interactive so everyone that's on the call can have reactions, can share their comments and leave comments while the presentation is happening without actually disrupting any of the flow for the user, so we use that a lot for presentations as well.

(00:58:15):
I would say more recently what we've started to do is that we've started to move some of our synchronous meetings into asynchro view. I talked about this Talktrack feature that we have, and a lot of teams, what they would do is that they would actually send you five minute, 10 minute Talktrack in advance and it's just a link to a Miro board, you click on it and then you just sit back and relax. Then you have this magical experience where you're sitting back and the Miro board is automatically moving because Lenny was recording it like that. Then you have the video play and then you can pause it anytime, you can add in your comments and stuff so that the next time when you meet, instead of actually providing context to everyone, those synchronous sessions are lot more deliberate and focused on driving outcomes or achieving consensus, so people are just focusing on the comments that were added as part of a async product review so that when they meet synchronously they can use that. Miro boards are used for that as well.

(00:59:06):
I would say now a lot of our dashboarding shows up in Miro boards now. We recently released data visualization capabilities around most popular VI tools. At Miro we use Google Looker a lot, so a lot of our dashboards are in Looker, and what you would typically find is that our analyst team and product teams will just grab a link to a Looker dashboard, put it on a Miro board, and it unfolds into a full visualization. Unlike a screen grab, you never have to go update it because right there on the Miro board, it's always updated and you can refresh that, so you basically have this experience where Miro acts as that single source of truth for a lot of the teams across the entire journey of product development where a single Miro board is meeting the needs of multiple use cases there.

Lenny (00:59:51):
Then for the road-mapping, is that in Miro, each team's roadmap, or do you use something like Jira?

Varun Parmar (00:59:57):
Yeah, so I think we've got a couple of tools for road-mapping, and our observation is that while those tools are great for the unique needs that they're solving, we haven't found a universal solution for road-mapping. So there are some teams that use Miro for road-mapping and they would use the Kanban widget in Miro for that. What are they working on? What's coming next? What's in the backlog? But I would say it is a problem that is not completely solved in terms of how do we actually bring these artifacts together at scale.

(01:00:27):
What we are starting to see, and this is actually a unique use case of Miro, is that we actually enable our entire field organization using Talktracks. What happens is that we have our entire roadmap published out as a Miro board for enablement purposes, so that that's a artifact that is approved to be shown to a customer. What you will see is that you'll see five or six recordings in there, and the leader for enterprise has done a five-minute recording on everything they're working on. The leader for platform has done that. The leader for end user experience has done that. The person who's driving some of our AI experience has done that. So you can go in and you can just click on that video and you can meet your needs by using Miro and this capability that we have.

Lenny (01:01:09):
That's awesome. It sounds like each team can basically choose the tools they want to use. There's no standardized, everyone needs to use Jira or Miro for their roadmap. I like that. I like how teams do that often. Maybe one last question around the product org, and then I want to shift a little bit to growth and how Miro grows and things you have learned about growing. Question I always try to get to is how do you think about balancing new bets and innovation with maintenance and just general incremental work? Do you have some sort of philosophy as a product leader broadly, and then maybe at Miro specifically, of just how to balance investments in these two buckets and maybe three buckets, bugs, incremental work, and then just big bet? How do you think about that?

Varun Parmar (01:01:55):
We have some rule of thumbs in terms of how we want to allocate our investments across these buckets. I would say a lot of it, Lenny, actually depends on the state of the team. There are certain teams that have more tech debt than others. There are certain teams that are actually working on some really big zero to one features than other teams, and so I think there is a variance. The standard deviation actually is dependent on which part of the spectrum that you're in, which is are you a team that we believe needs to create the next generation experience on the platform and hence we have to prioritize innovative work or are you the team that's actually so critical to actually meeting our objective around better board performance or any of the other things that we believe are important and hence we need to invest in those critical areas?

(01:02:41):
But I would say in general innovation versus not, varies on a spectrum of anywhere from 60 to 80%. I would say about 20 to 40% of the available capacity at any given time is either getting allocated to architectural initiatives. There's a technology roadmap that our CTO is driving that we believe is extremely important as the platform scales, and now as we have over 50 million people on the platform, so we continuously have to invest in making sure that the platform can scale. There are certain teams that probably have 40 to 50% of their allocation towards that because they're a critical part of the component. There are other teams that are maybe more end user focused and are more UI focused where that allocation is lower. But I think general rule of thumb is 20% is always a given, but it can go as high as 40 to 50%.

Lenny (01:03:30):
On bigger bets and longer-term thinking?

Varun Parmar (01:03:33):
Yeah, 20 to 40% goes on the technology-related initiatives and maintenance and stuff.

Lenny (01:03:38):
Oh, got it. Infrastructure, maintenance, making sure everything's there. Got it.

Varun Parmar (01:03:44):
[inaudible 01:03:44] Exactly, yeah.

Lenny (01:03:44):
Then what about just big, long-term bets that you're not expecting to pay off anytime soon? Do you have a heuristic of just what percentage of, say, total resources you put there?

Varun Parmar (01:03:53):
You've probably seen this, the framework of three horizon, it's quite popular in McKinsey and Harvard [inaudible 01:04:01] school and so on and so forth, is horizon one business, which is the thing that's delivering food on the table. Generally there's about a 70% allocation of resources that we have, give or take. Then there is horizon two, which is an adjacent thing. With the next 12 to 36 months we believe it's material. Usually that tends to be around 20% of the allocation. Then there's horizon three, which is three years out, three to five years, next generation things, and that's about 10% of the ratio. So it's like 70/20/10 across horizon one, two, and three.

Lenny (01:04:30):
Awesome. Any other thoughts along the lines of just how you think about product before we shift? I only have a few questions around the growth story of Miro and what you've learned about growing.

Varun Parmar (01:04:41):
In terms of product leadership and what we believe is the way we want product leaders to be developed and I think it's more of a people philosophy. We have our product leadership which constitutes of all of the folks who are running all of these streams, and I always tell them that you have two personas that you have to think about. Everyone who's on the product leadership team is a product leadership team member. The fundamental thing that you have to do is drive accountability. The number one thing that a product leader on the product leadership team needs to do is drive accountability with others in the product leadership team. The other persona that they have is that they are a stream leader. They're actually responsible for delivering value for the respective persona and respective customers and stuff. So when you put on the persona hat of a stream leader, which is different than the persona or of a product leader, your number one metric, the number one goal that you have, is drive improvement.

(01:05:42):
When you go back and you work with your team, always have the lens are you improving things and whatever you want to improve, but you always have to ask yourself, "Today compared to yesterday, tomorrow compared to today, have I improved things? That's the yardstick you should think about. When you go sit in the product leadership team every Monday afternoon at 1:00 in the afternoon when we meet together, your number one goal is actually to drive accountability around this and are you making sure that we as leaders in the organization are doing the right thing for the company?" I think that's a philosophical construct that I always remind people in terms of what they should be doing. As an example, tomorrow we have calibrations, we have our annual review cycle happening in the company.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Good times. Always a blast.

Varun Parmar (01:06:23):
Yes, exactly, always fun and so critical as a leader, because it sets the tone for everything that you're going to do. In my opening remarks, the only thing I'm going to remind everyone in the room is that "Your number one goal here is to be a product leader and accountability is what you have to write. That's it. Just hold each other as accountable, including myself in terms of making sure that as we go in, that's the key thing." I think once people understand the duality of how they need to operate across those two specific goals, it actually leads to really high-performing teams and teams that actually are able to create somewhat of a magic if they are open and there is trust that has been built in the team.

Lenny (01:07:07):
When you say accountability, what does that look like? Is it pointing out, "Hey, you didn't achieve this thing we were trying to achieve" or "You didn't do a great job leading this meeting"? Is it just direct feedback often or is there some other way you see that manifested, and what do you like to see?

Varun Parmar (01:07:24):
Yeah, I think it's basically practicing feedback in a very open and constructive way and focusing on what is important for the business and not shying away from having some of those observations and conversations, not shying away from them. But it's all in the lens of what is the right thing to do for the business, and if you feel that that one or more members of the leadership team are not living up to what needs to be done, then just voicing it. It's not like you're complaining or anything, it's just like, "I have this perspective. Is this the right perspective or not?" Because actually it ties very well with the overall cultural values that we have.

(01:08:02):
If you do things with the lens that you are being empathetic, then you pose it as a question as opposed to a statement. I think that's one of the things that we practice a lot at Miro is that I believe that I am seeing there are certain things that are happening that it could be just me that I'm not seeing the other things. "But what is it? Can you help me understand? Can you help me figure out that why certain things are happening? Because I might just be missing the perspective." But because you bring it up, and that's part of practicing accountability in an empathetic way, it actually gets the entire team in the right mindset in terms of how they operate.

Lenny (01:08:39):
Has anyone given you some sort of direct feedback recently or pointed out something you didn't do well that held you accountable that you can share?

Varun Parmar (01:08:47):
All the time. Yeah, all the time. When we do our offsites, this is actually a fun thing, is that every offsite that I do with my leadership team, usually there is a one to two hour session where it is feedback to Varun, and I actually do it openly. I will have about eight to 10 people in the room and I will force people to be very honest and I want to show my vulnerabilities to everyone, that I am not perfect and I have lots of areas to improve. Every time people do it, it's interesting that they open up in very amazing ways and I think I love it because it helps me become better. It helps me identify my blind spots. But what it does is, because I do it in an open way, it brings a lot of trust. It brings trust that I do it openly and I'm an open book and they can share whatever they want, not just with me but openly in front of everyone.

Lenny (01:09:43):
Are you willing to share one thing they suggested that they pointed out that they wish you did differently or better?

Varun Parmar (01:09:48):
Yeah, I think in general, finding time with me tends to be a bit of a hard thing, and generally there's always this feedback, which is need more time, maybe more responsiveness over email or Slack or something like that. That's an area that I'm constantly working on and improving, so yeah.

Lenny (01:10:11):
That feels like a cop out. That doesn't feel too painful to hear. I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't have a lot of time. I'm sorry." But I get it, and that comes back to your point about blockers and how important it's to unblock teams because that leads to a lot faster progress.

Varun Parmar (01:10:26):
That's true, that's true.

Lenny (01:10:28):
Okay, so let me shift a little bit to Miro's growth and I only have a few questions here. I know it's getting late on your side so I don't want to keep you too long.

Varun Parmar (01:10:34):
Sure.

Lenny (01:10:35):
The first is something I'm on this constant quest to understand how companies got their first users, and I haven't actually heard the story of how Miro got its first thousand users or customers. I know you weren't there in the early days, but you happen to know how Miro initially grew and got their first thousand users and customers?

Varun Parmar (01:10:53):
I think the fundamental thing there is that we always had user first approach and reaching out to certain communities that were relevant to what was a key part of lighting the fire, if you will, the proverbial way people start to talk about the product. Given the collaborative nature of the product, some of the early adopters invited people who were also early adopters and the flywheel started to work. I've heard that we did a fair amount of content marketing and listing the product on sites like Capterra sort of helped. There was some early investments in terms of SEO and organic growth, so there was a focus there, which was the main source of driving traffic. The top of the funnel came through that.

(01:11:43):
The product teams were very intensely focused on building vital loops as a key mechanism of driving growth, once the traffic came in. Every interaction that actually introduced barrier, they looked at it and they looked at the data and they said, "Let's reduce this barrier. Let's remove this thing so that the product could be effectively embraced." It was an evolution over a period of time. There was also the fact that early on in the journey, some of the features were presented on a trial basis and then later on the model was evolved from a trial basis, time limited to a premium model that further accelerated the growth for the business. I would say those were some of the approaches that were taken to get to the first thousand users or so.

Lenny (01:12:34):
You talked about how Miro grows, where it has this magical loop of "I use Miro to for myself, then I share it with my team in whatever way I'm using it." They're like, "Oh, Miro, this is cool." Then they start using it and then they share it with people that they want to work with, and it creates this loop of growth." I imagine that's how Miro mostly grew initially and continues to grow. Is there anything surprising or unintuitive about how Miro grows that is beyond that? I imagine sales is a part of it and we can talk about that, but is there anything else that is interesting that is worth mentioning?

Varun Parmar (01:13:07):
No, I think that's the key of the growth. I think there are specific use cases where they are uniquely sort of geared towards inviting a lot of new people. For example, Miro is loved as a workshopping tool, and so generally one person is using Miro, but they invite 10, 15, 20, 50, 200, 300 people to that workshop. There are specific use cases where people get introduced to the product and then go and sign up for it and then start to use it for that use case or other use cases. I think the other accelerant in all of this is the templates that we have, in particular the role that Miroverse plays in all of this.

(01:13:49):
Just to give you an example here, there was a template which was created around FIFA World Cup, so there was a FIFA World Cup diagram. Cornelius, he's the founder and managing director of a Canadian strategic service design consultancy firm. He created this Miroverse template and it had over 100,000 views and about 15,000 copies were made of the single template. Given the popularity of all of this, it actually got indexed by Google. When you went in the search, you actually saw the Miroverse FIFA template show up when you were trying to search for FIFA World Cup, and that was another sort of acquisition channel top of funnel that actually drew a lot of users to it. So I think I would say the Miroverse is also a key accelerant to this.

Lenny (01:14:45):
If you had to think about the pie chart of how Miro grows, what percentage roughly would you say is word of mouth, organic, versus what you just described, which is essentially a CO versus sales, outbound sales? How do you think about that? Is there a way to model that simply?

Varun Parmar (01:15:02):
Without getting into specific numbers and stuff, I would say fundamentally Miro is a product-led growth company and product channels are one of the highest contributors for growth of users. As the business has evolved to serve the needs of some of the largest corporations in the world, the enterprise segment and the enterprise persona when they're trying to provision Miro for tens of thousands of users who then go conduct hundreds of thousands of workshops on Miro that invite millions of users on the platform, is a key part of the flywheel that we are seeing. I would say product channels are probably very strong and increasingly enterprise is a key part of that acceleration.

Lenny (01:15:53):
A great segue to our final question, which is the idea that you started a product growth, sounds like clearly it's a big part of growth today, but as every product growth company does eventually you have a large sales team, I imagine, what have you learned as a product leader working with sales, especially at a product growth company about how to make that relationship work and have a product work effectively with a sales org?

Varun Parmar (01:16:15):
There are a few learnings and I would say maybe this is one area where we are working on how we could be doing better in terms of bringing ourselves closer to our high-touch and bringing high-touch closer to self-serve, in terms of how we operate overall. It's a lot of hard work, I would say first of all, basically, to bring both of these organizations together and you have to be very deliberate around the points of intersection and you have to make sure that these organizations don't consider themselves as competition. It's one product, one company, just two channels of how we are serving our customers. There's some things that we've done which is have the product marketing team that basically works across both of these functions and make sure that they are bridging what we are hearing from the sales organization in terms of what directly customers need on the enterprise side, and then what do we need on the self-serve side.

(01:17:23):
There's a full process in terms of how the handoff happens across the maturity of the account. It can start as a self-serve, it drives adoption, and once there's adoption, there's a hand raiser that happens and then there's a sales rep that gets engaged and you go through the qualification process and then you have an opportunity to expand the account. We've over the years sort of architected and built the entire funnel and what the process is, and that's also sort of a key part of how all of this operates. But like I said, I think there are a few areas where we could further streamline how we operate and think of it as one single unit.

Lenny (01:18:05):
I imagine that is true for every company out there.

Varun Parmar (01:18:07):
Yes.

Lenny (01:18:09):
One maybe final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. What are some features that people could look forward to that are coming with Miro?

Varun Parmar (01:18:19):
We recently, about a month ago, announced Miro AI, the backdrop of all the amazing work that's happening around generative AI and large language models and stuff. I think it was really, really exciting to see all of the community enthusiasm around the use cases that we launch. So we're going to be taking it across the finish line and doing a general availability in the coming weeks and months. I think that's one big thing and we'll be adding more capabilities there. Just today we actually announced a bunch of really deep enhancements and updates around how Miro can be used for team rituals and agile practices. Now you can actually do retrospectives in Miro where you can have a private mode where while Lenny's typing his feedback during retrospective, nobody else can see it and then one click you can reveal it. I just saw some of the results of the feedback and it was rated as the number one feature people saw.

(01:19:14):
There's also some deeper integrations in terms of bringing an entire program board from Jira to start to do dependency mapping inside of Miro in a fun and collaborative way, to use this dependency mapping along with program board to start to do program increment planning, which is essentially scrum of scrums or big room planning that's happening. There's some really amazing capabilities that we've added there, which is on the backdrop of some of the updates we've made in terms of estimation of sprint story points and so on and so forth. Now there's a whole plethora of capabilities and apps that are available as part of the platform that allow you to have your entire team conduct your team rituals in Miro and you can automate certain things, you can streamline things, you can do certain things in async and then do the rest in synchronous ways, so I think that's been a big update as well.

Lenny (01:20:12):
Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Varun Parmar (01:20:19):
Yes.

Lenny (01:20:20):
All right, let's do it. What are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Varun Parmar (01:20:26):
One is, I love this, When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. It's one of those really emotional books that at the end of it, you might have tears in your eyes, but really, really amazing. We talked about Frank Slootman's Amp It Up, and then Satya Nadella's Hit Refresh. I think philosophically some of the things that we talked about today are inspirations that I found in some of these books.

Lenny (01:20:49):
What's a recent favorite movie or TV show?

Varun Parmar (01:20:52):
Ted Lasso. I don't know if it's a recent one or not, but something-

Lenny (01:20:55):
It's a new season.

Varun Parmar (01:20:57):
Yeah, I've enjoyed a lot. I think it's a very positive and uplifting message. I think the performance is huge. It's humorous, the characters are well-developed, so I think overall it's a treat, at least for, me to watch.

Lenny (01:21:13):
What's a favorite interview question you like to ask?

Varun Parmar (01:21:16):
I actually ask a math problem. For those of you who interviewed with me, I have this math problem, which is based on how Adobe created its first Creative Suite bundle. I was actually part of the team that came up with the pricing and packaging for the first Creative Suite post-acquisition of Macromedia. It's a math problem that allows you very quickly to figure out people in terms of their problem-solving skills. Usually I give that problem to people. I've given it to, I don't know, 700, 800 people, so I now have a very, very well established standard distribution of how long it takes for people, where do they get stuck and where they've gotten stuck, for those people I've hired, what evidence do I have in terms of using that as a framework in terms of them being able to solve things? So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:22:08):
So you're saying you've mapped back people that have done a certain way on the problem with their success and you've kind of found that it's a good signal of their performance?

Varun Parmar (01:22:17):
Yes. Not directly, but yes, correlation and stuff.

Lenny (01:22:21):
That's amazing. That's one of the biggest problems with interviewing. You think you're asking all these amazing questions and it's such a good signal, you have no idea. No one goes back and is like, "Oh, this person sucked. This person didn't... " That's really cool to get that much data on that one question. Two more questions for you. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in how you do product development that has had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute?

Varun Parmar (01:22:44):
We talked about some of that, sort of removing the roadblocks. I think having this motto of great customer value faster with high quality, just the simplicity of that and it's actually part of our evaluation rubric, it's part of how we measure ourselves and stuff. So I think just coming up with these simple concepts that you can rally the organization around, and I think it's still a work in progress, but something that I believe is leading to positive outcomes.

Lenny (01:23:07):
Final question. What's your favorite Miro template?

Varun Parmar (01:23:10):
It's the FIFA World Cup actually. I am so fascinated with what was done. Yeah, it's the latest one, but I think there's a bunch of them in terms of retros as well, and I think... like your template as well.

Lenny (01:23:21):
Amazing. We will link to all of those. Varun, this was amazing. Everything I expected and more, your team is as interesting and unique as I thought, and I am excited for people to learn from you and we're going to share a lot of links alongside this episode in the show notes. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Varun Parmar (01:23:43):
Thank you, Lenny. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed our interaction. You folks can find me online on LinkedIn. I think that's probably the best way to connect with me. I think in terms of one or two things I can ask everyone is that, one is if you are an existing Miro user and you use the product for something interesting, I highly encourage you to contribute it as a template as part of Miroverse. There's a lot of folks who use that and we would love for you to contribute there. The second thing is, I know a lot of product development teams, PMs and designers are big fans of you, Lenny, so those are also the users that use Miro. If there's anything we could do to make the product better, if there's things that you feel like we can expand the platform into, we would love to hear from you and just reach out to me directly over LinkedIn, direct message or connect with me there and yeah, and let us know. We're here to serve.

Lenny (01:24:40):
Amazing. Varun, thank you again for being here.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:07):
I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things. What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:22):
Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc? You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
I'm curious what you found most impedes people's career growth.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:37):
How you view change, whether you are focusing on things you control, and third is how you see yourself. The moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Vikrama Dhiman. Vikrama heads all things product at Gojek, including product management, design, program management, research and insights with teams across India, Singapore and Indonesia.

(00:03:56):
Vikrama, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:00):
Thank you for inviting me, Lenny. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:03):
So as you know and hopefully as listeners know, I'm on this quest to meet the most insightful product leaders from all over the world and your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia. And you're also the third guest from Gojek, so there's definitely something in the water over there and I want to talk about that. To just dive right in, you have a very strong reputation for building incredibly strong product talent and also design talent, and also helping people transition from other roles into product management, which a lot of people listening to this podcast dream to do. So I'm going to ask a bunch of questions around this area. How does that sound?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:47):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
Okay. First question is just when you think back to the people that have done best in the product management role and have had a rapid career rise, what are some of the most common traits or behaviors or habits that you find in these people?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:05:05):
Over the last decade and a half, I've had the opportunity to work with some really strong product managers, learn from strong product managers, and some of them have had rapid career growth. When I was younger and I was starting off, I used to think it's all about the product. If you've got a really cool product to work on, your growth's guaranteed. And if you got really a product which no one cares about or a stream which no one cares about, then your growth is going to be slightly slower. But as I started seeing more and more product managers at their craft, I saw that working on a cool product area is not the only thing. In fact, sometimes some product managers would come back and complain that despite their product doing really well, they've not really grown.

(00:05:51):
And while some other product managers whose product didn't have the impact really grew. And as I started looking at it and as I started making notes, as I started talking to other product leaders, what I discovered was that the really strong product managers who were also growing in their careers did some things differently. And based on that, I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things, and I call it three W's. So what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? The really strong product managers are good at usually two of the three things. The ones who rise and when they are rising, they are performing well on all the three access. So if you would like, let's talk a little bit more about each one of these W's.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
Yeah, I would love to. I love that you put the word what at the top and that makes it the three W's, which is clever because I find even if the acronym is not necessary, it's really helpful to help people remember so I totally respect what you did there. So the three is what you produce, what you bring to the table and what your operating model is. Is that right?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:09):
Yes, absolute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
Okay, cool. Yeah, let's talk about these.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:11):
So what you produce, a lot of people index on the impact while and they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy. While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on.

(00:08:14):
And when you start figuring out which outcomes are necessary, that is when you move to the leadership and directional areas. The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:20):
So highlighting one insight here is that a lot of advice you hear about how to do well in your career, which you pointed out at the beginning here, is it's not just not immediately drive impact. That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:09:51):
Absolutely. So outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:54):
The way I think about what you're describing, which I actually 100% agree with, is when you're starting out in your careers, execution is where you need to deliver. People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:25):
Absolutely. So focus on outputs at the start of your careers and don't forget outputs even when you grow in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
So along those lines, just to close the thread on this idea, it's still helpful if you work on something that does have impact that matters, right? How important is that? And you said that you've seen successful product managers work on things that aren't as impactful and still do really well, but I guess would your advice be tried [inaudible 00:11:52] be in a place that is going to drive more impact versus it's not actually that important in the early career?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:58):
So I'll give you my example. In one of my previous roles, there were two product areas that were important for the organization. My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
I love that. Yeah, basically when you're just starting out, just execute well, execute smoothly, ship things on time. I'm going to say a few things, but I'm curious what else comes to mind here of just what does good output look like? Is it do things that are helpful to your team and manager, ship things on time, bug-free, have a clean road map, everyone's aligned behind, [inaudible 00:13:11] deadlines, things like that. I guess what else along those lines should people be like, "Okay, here's what I should be doing to have good outputs?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:13:16):
Some of the things that I think are useful. So first, what's output? Output is something which is very tangibly defined, which doesn't take too much of your time, effort, and energy to visualize and think and strategize over and you are able to quickly get moving on. Go and ask your product leader, go and ask other leaders on what are the areas they are blocked on. Sometimes they will be blocked on, "Hey, I need to prepare this brief for this particular summit", "I need to prepare this particular slide for a leadership review", "I need to prepare a review, I need to prepare a review which has to be done with the legal." You can volunteer and definitely own and deliver the first drafts of those even if the final draft is not something that you own. That's a simple example of an output, which I feel a lot of people miss because they want to be focusing on the bigger strategic pieces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
It's basically be useful. That's the way I always like to talk about this, just like your job as a PM is be useful, make your team more effective, help your company be more successful. Just find ways to be useful to everyone around you.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:14:27):
Absolutely. And be useful in doing the small things which make an impact and also contribute to your learning versus being useful in areas which you think the mini CEO should be working on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Right. There's all this talk about being an empowered product manager, building empowered product teams. I think there's an important nuance. When you're just starting out, you haven't earned the right to inform strategy and vision people. Why would people follow you at this point? We just need to get stuff done, so that comes over time.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:01):
Absolutely. And it's not just when you are starting off or when you are young. Even with if you are senior and you're starting off with a new team, even if you're starting with a new company, you need to have that mindset. And sometimes you will not know the best. And we'll talk more about how to, what is your operating model, which is how you work with others. It's a very, very important thing for you to know that you are one part of the cog wheel, you're not the entire wheel yourself. And a lot of the folklore around product managers can make you confused, especially when you're starting off in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:40):
I love it. Okay, let's keep going. Number two.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:43):
Number two is what you bring to the table. Now, I think how I describe that is what is your impact on impact? So the first access is impact, but you also need to have an impact on impact. And this is what I had missed a lot in my early career, that you put the coolest product areas, your product area is successful and that automatically guarantees your growth. It doesn't. You have to also show that yes, you were a useful contributor to having that particular impact. The simplest thing on this is that is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? Are you making sure that you are deriving from the strategy that has been shaped or you're constantly just pushing back on the strategy? Similarly, you also how you are drafting the north stars, how you are working on the experiments, how you're working on the data, how you're working on the metrics.

(00:16:43):
All these things take time, effort, and energy. And I know there is some literature and there are some operating models where people are working only at strategy levels while all of these execution of these artifacts is being done by some other people. I don't think, especially when you are starting off, that's a very, very good thing. Even when you are mid-senior, I don't think that's a very, very good thing. You have to have to be able to produce these artifacts which are product artifacts. Even if there are people in strategy creating their artifacts, even if design is coming up with a design brief, you need to have a cohesive product strategy or product PRD and work backwards from PRD and product knows yourself. These things are important to show you are progressing on four pillars, which is data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy.

(00:17:41):
Product managers constantly are evaluated on this when you interview, but you also have to demonstrate these on the jobs. And the best way to demonstrate these is through the artifacts, through the notes that you are sending. So you must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on. For a lot of product managers, when I ask, "Hey, I was working on this very impactful area. I'm not able to have the impact on my career, what is missing?" And when I go and ask, "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems?" Usually, you'll find something or the other missing.

(00:18:31):
In cases that those are bad, you will find that the pre-iteration planning, pre-sprint plannings are not running properly. You will find that the Jira storyboards are very empty and there's just a title in the subject and nothing gets described and so on. So you'll miss all these pieces. So these are the things which you bring to the table and it's very, very important that you work on these aspects as well. Finally, we have what's your operating model, which I feel is the most important thing which you have to have to focus if you are going from mid-senior to senior level. This is essentially about communication, collaboration, organizational skills and community skills.

(00:19:16):
And across product managers, again, because of the folklore of mini CEO and others, I see that a lot of people get carried away in the way they operate as product managers with other stakeholders. There are three tenets that I define in working well as a product manager with others. Number one is raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with. Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself. And finally, you are in charge of getting the decisions made and not making all the decisions yourself. I think as long as you follow these three tenets, you will have a successful relationship across stakeholders. These three tenets are easy to say, but they become very, very hard to embody and display on a day-to-day basis. But this is essentially going to be your struggle no matter at what level of product management you are operating at in your career or within your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
First of all, can you just repeat them? Because I think this is... Essentially, it's like a mantra that PMs can think back to of, "Am I doing these things?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:20:36):
So the three things which are very important for product managers to work with others and other stakeholders are raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with, bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself, and be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
I like this list a lot. It reminds me, there's this product leader I worked with who their team got pushed to do a bunch of stupid stuff. And he realized later that, "Hey, it's actually my job to have pushed back on doing this stuff." He was the head of product for this business unit and he realized, "Oh, I see. That's actually what I should be doing now that I'm in this role." And you sometimes forget that one, you have that influence. And two, that's something you should be doing.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:21:33):
Absolutely, absolutely. It's always within your control and it's always the things that are within your control that you should be controlling rather than focusing on the things that are not within your control and obsessing about those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I'm so aligned with the way you think about all these things. Coming back to the second actually, just to give people something they can do with this trait. So the way I think about what you described, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting it, is there's a detail-oriented-ness, high quality-ness to the way that you should be crafting all the documents/artifacts you're creating, your one-pagers/PRDs, your roadmaps, your strategy docs, just like they should be really high quality. So along those lines, if you're an ICPM trying to get better at this stuff, how have you found is the best way to level up in these things? Is it working with your manager and getting feedback? Is it peers? What helps somebody get better at the quality and yeah, the quality of these documents?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:22:34):
What you bring to the table is one of the most misunderstood attributes and aspects of product management. On one end, you could get around and say, "Here is my PRD, here is my JIRA board, here are my stories, here is my pre-sprint planning or pre-iteration planning document" and go. It's not just about the spread and the width of the things that you're doing, but it's also about the depth of those things as well. Some product managers, what they bring to the table is arguments, what they bring to the table are debates, what they bring to the table are pushbacks, while others are able to channelize the questions, channelize the inputs, channelize the direction and convert that into strategic choices which can then shape discussions, which can then shape direction. Be the latter and you will rise faster in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
So you have these three buckets of what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is, the three W's. So let try to summarize and see what I missed and then we'll move on. So one is just focus on executing, getting things done that are helpful to your team, your company, your manager, and focus on just getting stuff out. Not so much in necessarily in strategy. Even when you're a manager and a leader and a VP, just like you're still responsible for producing things, not just telling people and being wise. Two, what you bring to the table, my takeaway here is produce high quality artifacts that raise the bar.

(00:24:05):
The way I think about this is as a PM, you want to have this aura of I got this. People put something on your plate, you want to feel like Lenny's got this, I'm not going to have to worry. It's going to be forgotten and I know it's going to be done well. And then the third piece is this idea of an operating model. Basically just make sure decisions are being made. It's not about you that you're pushing back on bad ideas. Is there anything else I missed before we move on?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:24:31):
No. I think the art of pushback is another important factor because if you're pushing back a lot and the way you are pushing back matters a lot as well. Just don't be someone who's seen as an obstacle and a hindrance and as someone who's just very difficult to work with, but rather see as someone who's able to actually add value to whatever your leader, your stakeholders, your product area demands and you are able to advance the product and the direction and execution forward. Once you do that, I think keeping that as the intent and ensuring that your team is getting unblocked and not getting to do work on anything which is stupid or is likely to be changed, then you've really got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:23):
Do you have any advice for how to pushback in a way, the way you describe it is not to be difficult to work with or without seeking importance? I guess is there words or phrases or approaches you found are effective for pushing back against ideas that you disagree with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:25:38):
What I've seen that people who do pushback very successfully and are still considered not difficult to work with, they are also able to bring the tempo of the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional space. I think that's such a useful skill and I sometimes am guilty of operating on a slightly emotional note, which is useful. Sometimes you need a war cry, you need a high pitch, you need execution on war footing. All that is fine, but it's only fine in some cases. In other cases, it's always very important that you're able to bring it down to the logical space so that a logical and a little more equal footing of the discussion can happen. And a lot of this is something that leaders need to ensure is happening, but product managers and product leaders who are working with executives who are able to bring this tempo down and bring it to a little more logical space will also do far better in their careers and they'll also have a lot more rapid career growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
So let's talk about the flip side of rapid career growth, which is career growth that stalls. And I'm curious what you've found most impedes people's career growth. What do PMs do that shoot themselves in the foot and slow their career? Any pitfalls do you find are important to try to watch out for?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:27:15):
I think part of it is on a lot of us in product leadership space. We've not done a very good job in defining rubrics, growth frameworks and so on. But even in places where growth frameworks exist, like three W's, what I've seen is that clean mindset shifts and changes can enable faster growth, but those mindset and changes also can hinder your growth, right? So the first thing is whether you are focusing on things you control or whether you're focusing on things that are beyond your control. Second, what's your relationship with change? And third is how you see yourself. The third is very, very powerful and we'll talk about that as well. The first is what you control. If you drew an access of what you control and what you cannot control, as you're starting your career, most of the work that you're doing is in what you control, right?

(00:28:15):
You are very obsessed with feedback, you're very obsessed with, "Okay, can I do this?" "Can I do this?" "Okay, I'll probably not do this. I'll probably do this", and so on. You're not worrying about the overall corporate strategy, you're not looking at what the competitors are doing, what is their market cap and all those things. You're focused a lot on your craft, you're focused on a lot on your output and you're focused on how you are growing. As you start becoming mid-senior, I see the conversation shifts from what can I do, how am I learning, how am I growing, to why is the organization not doing this for me? Why can that stakeholder not change this thing about themselves? Why do I not get to work on projects like this? Things which start going outside your control. And it is very, very important that you keep your focus no matter what stage of career you get into what you can control.

(00:29:16):
And again, it's easy to say that everything in universe should be in your control. It doesn't happen like that, but a large number of things that impact your career are within your control. And go back to the three W's that we spoke about, what you work on, what you produce or what do you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? And there is tons to do on data, tons to do on technology, tons to do on communication, collaboration, design and research, strategy and community. And you can spend years and years and years crafting those things. Focus on those things, growth will happen at every single stage. The second aspect of it is your relationship with change. Again, when you are younger, when you're starting off, rate of change is crazy. You are growing almost every six months. You are picking up skills and experimentation, you're picking up skills in how to analyze.

(00:30:15):
You're picking up skills in how to work with different kind of stakeholders. And since the rate of change of your skills is high, your rate of growth is also high. Again, as you start becoming mid-senior, I start seeing conversations on, "Okay, maybe I should not do that. Maybe I should not take on this product. I don't know what it means for my career. I don't know what it means for my growth" and so on. So your rate of change slows down. So it's very important that as you get to mid-senior level, you are constantly checking on what you can do to keep increasing your rate of change. And one of the simplest things that you can do is if you think you are four on data, figure out who. And you may be four on data out of five in data. Within your organization, start benchmarking yourself with the best in the industry.

(00:31:13):
You'll automatically see that your scale drops and as your scale drops, you start seeing what you need to improve and do. If you start seeing that on communication and collaboration, you're reaching four out of five within the PMR, start mapping yourself to other stakeholders in other functions. Again, your score will fall in your eyes and you will start figuring out what are the things that you can do as well. So keep your focus on rate of change and rate of growth will automatically take care of itself. Sometimes it also involves changing your team or even changing your company, but those should be the last results. There are significant things that you can do within that as well. One of the final things that I see which limits you, especially as you start growing in your career and you reach mid-senior levels is how you see yourself.

(00:32:04):
I see a lot of product... And I've been guilty of that. When I see that a lot of product managers, that's included me at some stage, doing these things, people will come back and say, "Oh, I am a very high agency PM" or, "I'm a very collaborative PM." Earlier on, I used to think that okay, I need to give this kind of work to these product managers. I need to fit them with these kind of team, these kind of work areas, these kind of opportunities. But then I started understanding these things are not just signaling, they are also anti-signaling. They are like, "Oh, I'm high agency. So it's sometimes okay if I'm little brash, if I cut corners somewhere, if I sometimes come across as a little rude to some people" and so on, right?

(00:32:55):
Similarly, if I'm seen as a hyper-collaborative person, so it's okay if sometimes I'm not very decisive, if I'm not moving fast and so on because I'm this kind of a PM. So it's very important that you check for what are the stories that you're telling yourself because those stories are defining you at a basic level, which is then very hard to correct through frameworks and structures. So figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well, and then correct those stories. And the moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
Wow, there's so much meat and wisdom in what you just shared. I want to go in so many different directions. Maybe just to follow on this last thread, did you go through something like that yourself where you have this sense of yourself that hindered you? Okay, awesome. You're nodding your head, if you're not on YouTube. Can you share that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:33:57):
Yeah. So I'll give an example of when I joined Gojek. The very first thing that I learned in my career was SQL and Oracle. And I was very proud of the fact that my data skills are awesome and I know several frameworks and I know several tools and so on. And when I joined Gojek and I saw one of your guests, Crystal, and I saw the work that she was doing and her team was doing and I just immediately was like, "Yeah, no, this is not... I'm nowhere near", right? And similarly, I also thought that my communication skills are really good and my product strategy skills are very good, but then I worked with people like Dito and people like Sidu who was so good at their craft that it challenged me to see that okay, what is it that I am missing? What is it that I am doing wrong?

(00:34:57):
And it auto-calibrated me in my eyes on where it was, but that also created a hunger in me that this is what I need to fix. And I immediately corrected my assessment of myself that I'm not the strongest product manager on data. I'm not the one who knows all the strategy pieces or even strategy frameworks or how to bring everything to a strategy point of view or communicate it from an effective perspective. And then I started framing I'm still in a learning phase. When I see that I'm not in that phase now, I try and make myself humble by interacting with people who are far smarter than me on different scale or reading different books, or watching podcasts like yourselves. And that keeps you grounded on the fact that okay, you are always learning. And I also found that seeing yourself as someone who's a learner is an enabling story to tell yourself, okay?

(00:35:58):
It may not be the most exciting story, it may not be the most memorable story about yourself, but it is definitely one of the enabling stories as well. Similarly, I think one other thing that I used to say about myself was more that I'm very high agency PM. But as I started working more in Southeast Asia, I learned that mindfulness is also very, very important, that not every team, not every culture will work with you in a very hyper aggressive style. But you still need to get the work done. And I'm still learning on that and therefore, I've started using a word, I don't want to be a high agency person, I want to be a mindful agency person. And so these terms are very important because these are the stories that you keep telling yourself and these also then start shaping your behavior. I do feel that I have a lot to do, I have a lot to learn on these skills, but these things definitely keep you grounded and you keep coming back to the learning phase again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:09):
It's interesting that when you saw Crystal being incredibly good at working with data, you just realized, "Hey, maybe I'm actually not very good at this." And your reaction wasn't, "God damn it, I'm really screwed and this is really depressing me", it's, "No, instead I'm going to try to get better at this." And that reminds me some of the feedback I get with this podcast, those people are like, "Man, these people are so good, I'm never going to be this good. It discourages me from thinking I will ever be super successful in this career." Clearly, you have a different approach. Do you have advice or guidance to folks that are sometimes discouraged seeing people being so incredible and helping them actually continue to level up in this rate of change you talked about versus just like, "Nope, I'm never going to be that good?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:37:54):
I think as product managers it becomes difficult because a lot of your growth is being determined because of feedback of others. And because product management is so ambiguous and still not defined, the stakeholders can also give feedback on variety of dimensions. Some of them may not even be important enough to give feedback on, but they are important enough for them and so therefore, they give you feedback. And therefore, you have to shape that feedback in. But you also have to consider that there are these eight access that we spoke about, the data access, the design and research access, the technology access, the strategy access, communication access, collaboration access, organizational skills access, and the community access. You need to channelize feedback into okay, is this an area that you are targeting for growth or not?

(00:38:51):
And one of the most important things that I learned was that when I joined Gojek or even earlier, there would be so many different areas that I needed to improve on and still need to improve on. You can't improve on every single area. That's what overwhelms you. You need to pick which is the area which is the maximum leverage for you and improve on that particular aspect and then move on to the next area, then move on to the next area and so on. Obviously, if you are floundering in something, if you're really negative in something, then you fix that first because that will give you the highest leverage. But if you are picking up data and design and strategy and technology all at the same time, that's when you'll overwhelm you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:33):
So to summarize the advice there is one, be actually very open to feedback you're getting. It's easy to say that, it's hard to actually listen to people criticizing you and act on it. So I think that's an important takeaway here is just actually, feedback is a gift and actually understand that and try to act on it. I have a great interview with Jules Walter who's a PM at Google now, and he has this awesome quote about how whenever people give him hard feedback, it's like internally he's just melting, but that's externally he's like, "Thank you so much for that feedback, I really appreciate it. It's very valuable."

(00:40:10):
And so that's a good way to get people to keep giving feedback. Okay. And then the other piece of advice you just shared there is pick a focus area. Like say you're getting all this feedback, your strategy isn't amazing, your PRDs aren't great, just find one thing to focus on. And I don't know, do you try to do somewhat quarter? Somewhat year? Do you have a heuristic of how long to spend on one thing?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:40:31):
So different skills take different time and how you are progressing also depends a lot as well. For skills which are softer in nature like communication and collaboration and community, those are skills that you will work on all your life. You'll never achieve anywhere near two or five on five on those ever. There'll always be something that you will miss, there will always be a new context, there'll always be a new set of stakeholders, new company cultures that you have to adapt to. For others, you have to see that what gives you the maximum leverage in your career. When you're starting off, my recommendation is that you pick between data and tech one, and definitely one on design and research and strategy.

(00:41:18):
So usually, that's the combo that I recommend. My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years. Once you've demonstrated on two of these three, between data, tech and design and research, then you start focusing on strategy. We've had great success at Gojek in transitioning a lot of product managers, especially in Indonesia, using this framework. And it's produced a lot of good product managers for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
Well, let's actually follow that thread. That's really interesting. And so the approach is you have this access of skillsets and you pick, for this person moving from say customer service to product, here's the two things you need to focus on. Can you talk more about that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:42:15):
Yeah. For instance, we recently had two PMs, one who came from a growth background. This is actually [inaudible 00:42:24]'s team. And one from a research background. And with both of them, we use very different tactics. So we gave one of finding driver redesign, which was very much a very design-focused product, but we still had them leverage their data skills because we were able to create a PRD with incredible amount of data on exactly what different segments of customers we're doing. And that then we worked with designers on what the designs and the framework for that will be. And even now, Lenny, if you will come and see our finding driver redesign next time you are in Asia, it's a piece of art. And if you would see that that was worked on by a product manager who actually came from a growth and data background, that makes it even more special.

(00:43:13):
Similarly, the PM who transitioned from research, I kept giving feedback on technology and data skills are the ones that we need to check. And I need to hear from engineers that yes, they're able to work with her very strongly. And once she was able to do that, she's recently turned a very heated question on one of the features that we were doing into a full-blown solution with designs, with trade-offs and everything, and able to now convert it into a question for leadership on how we should be approaching this particular product and direction. So I think that's proven successful as well. Similarly, there's another person who took risk who was originally from research and again, worked a lot on our products, including our enterprise product. And she's doing an amazing job as well. Again, going through that path of okay, these are the things that you need to leverage.

(00:44:14):
The only watch-out is that it doesn't work out always. In some cases, some PMs will pick these things up fast, and it also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills. But it's definitely doable if you get a very strong product leader working with you who's able to shape those skills for you. So it's sometimes okay to go a little slow when you're transitioning so that you're able to go faster later rather than getting faster somewhere and then being stuck there for a while.

(00:46:29):
Something that you mentioned earlier that I wanted to come back to is this confusion about what the PM role is and how that trips people up in being successful in the role and continuing to thrive in the role. You mentioned this to me offline too, that this is just something you deal with a lot, just this frustration of what the hell is this job? What am I actually responsible for? What am I not? What do you find is helpful in helping people work through that, get past that, not make that a big blocker in their career, not knowing exactly what the PM role is?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:46:56):
I think we've been in technology product for several decades now, but we are still figuring out what an exact definition of product management is. And even the strongest definitions are slightly principled and philosophical in nature, they're not very concrete, and that also means that every and different technology companies have gone through different journeys and they've defined the roles very, very differently. And even within a very large company, you will see that different teams, different divisions are approaching the roles very, very differently as well.

(00:47:34):
And on top of that, what that does is that not only internally the product managers are figuring this out, their managers, their leaders are figuring these things out for them, but the other stakeholders who have to work with these product managers are also confused and they don't know what to expect. And the number one question I get from stakeholders is, is a product manager expected to do this? Because they also don't know, okay, is this expected from a product manager or not? And my general answer to that is, if this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Love that.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:48:09):
But that works if the product managers have had some training and they have had some training in working with different stakeholders and they have had something on the job. What I've figured out is that there are certain functions and there are certain disciplines which you can't define, but you can only become better at with practice. For instance, what is an actor or what is a dancer? Right? So these are things that you will get better at as you become skilled at it. And earlier, these things used to be looked at as something which is very artistic, only the people who are talented or only specific kind of people can do it. But now, each one of those has become [inaudible 00:48:57] and frameworks as well. So there are courses on filmmaking, there are courses on acting, there are courses on dancing and so on. And similarly, product management is that space as well.

(00:49:08):
So you have to understand there's an art to it and there's a science to it, but you can use the science to figure out the art. So that's the philosophical side of it. The second side of it is what we spoke about earlier that instead of figuring out what is product management, figure out what's your contribution, what's your output and figure out are you contributing on these access on data, on design, on technology and on strategy. And one of my favorite things is that if you created these four circles of strategy, of technology, of design and of data, and you created a product management circle which encircles each one of these, so you are the only discipline, which is the co-collaborator for all of these disciplines and tying all these things out.

(00:49:59):
So it's not about you standing alone, it's you always collaborating and pairing with someone else. But you are the only one who's pairing with everyone else and therefore, you have that unique insight which no one else in the team will have. That role can be played by someone else, it doesn't necessarily need to be called a product manager. But if you are being called a product manager, you figure out the [inaudible 00:50:24] the time piece that you are. And when you are added to the team, you must dream the team's overall contribution, overall energy and overall output up and not down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that. Something I always tell people is the PM doesn't necessarily have the magical skills other team members don't have, it's that they don't also have another job. Engineers may do a great job at being the PM, they just also have to build and code. And they don't have time to do all the things that a PM has to do, and a designer is in the same way, a researcher or data person. And so oftentimes, that's just like there's this person that has the time to do all these glue, work things between teams. And the great PMs also are very good at these skills that help you do these things, but it doesn't mean other people can't do them.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:51:19):
You see yourself as playing a role and not your title and not your function, and that just clarifies a lot of things for people. And different people will play different roles. And depending on the kind of a PM you are, are you in a specific domain or you are slightly generalist, the role that you will be playing in different teams can be different and the variety of roles that you can play makes you a better product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
I love that. You've mentioned these four access attributes of great product managers, overall product managers. Let's just spend a little time here. So you say basically the things you need to be doing and good at, data, design/research technology, strategy, and then you also mentioned collaboration and communication. Maybe you're-

Vikrama Dhiman (00:52:08):
Yeah, organizational skills and community. I think those are very, very important because one of the things and one of the things which one of the product managers works with me continues to say, and I really plus on that a lot, is that product manager is the all community enabler in the team, in the organization. And that community is the software aspect which ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output. And that I think is a very, very important goal in today's context, especially for teams which are becoming more remote or teams where people are not co-located or they're distributed. That community aspect becomes a very, very important part that product managers need to focus on and bring and channelize as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):
So let's just quickly describe each of these attributes. I imagine people might be thinking, "Okay, what should I get better at as a PM?" And this is an awesome list. Each company has their own career ladders and attributes and things like that, but not a lot of companies don't. So I think for people that are trying to figure out where do I need to get better, I think this is a really cool list. Can you just maybe just a sentence explanation of each of these attributes and skillsets that a PM needs?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:31):
So each one of those skills, like the most growth ladders, what they will do, is they will have say for data, they will have level one, exhibits these traits. Level two, exhibits this trait. Level three, exhibits this trait. Level four and level five and so on. That's how they'll describe it. But five is absolute ninja level data quality, like you could probably do a data startup of your own.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:55):
Like Crystal basically?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:57):
Crystal. And level zero is someone who cannot even basically define the basic metrics for this particular product and won't be able to figure out is this particular thing impacting orders or users or revenue. And so you'll really not be able to figure even that piece out. Similarly, on design and research, for product managers, we focus a lot more on problems and are you able to identify problems from a user's perspective. That's at level zero. And level five will be somebody who's able to define the user problems but is also able to tie them to business roles as well. So that makes it the holistic. Similarly, on technology, it's one of the skills which is relatively easier to define where you don't have any tech understanding. If somebody asked you what is HTTP or API or internet and you'll be like, "Okay, I don't know what it is."

(00:54:55):
And while on the other end, you are able to have deep debates and could probably write technology design documents yourself as well. I think sometimes people get confused between data science. And in different organizations, I see data science bucketed either in data or in technology. Either is fine as long as you are clear on what your organization's framework is. Similarly then, there is strategy. Strategy is I think another area in product management which gets very confusing because there is obviously corporate strategy, there is business strategy, there's pricing strategy, there's strategy everywhere. Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece.

(00:55:47):
So you are not in charge of okay, are you focused on growth? Are you focused on revenue? Are you focused on profitability? That's someone's choice. Are you going to pick this country? Are you going to pick that country? But once that is picked, what are the user segments that you're going to focus on? What are the needs of those user segments? How are we going to figure out what the right product for them will be? What is the order in which we are going to work on that? That whole piece of product strategy is with the product managers. And again, in the first case, you are basically going to rely on everyone to tell you, do this, do this, do this. In second and in the level five cases, you are able to articulate a very coherent product strategy at a broad level as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
Amazing, thanks for sharing that. I think for people that are trying to craft career ladder for product managers, this could help inform the way they think about this. By the way, when we mentioned Crystal, for folks that have no idea who we're talking about, she was a early head of growth at Gojek back in the day. She was a previous guest on the podcast. I always forget how to pronounce her last name exactly, but I think it's Widjaja, Crystal Widjaja.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:56:33):
Widjaja.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
Widjaja? Okay, okay. Great. Going in a different direction, we're going to move to contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you believe that other people wouldn't agree with or generally just don't believe?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:57:12):
I used to think intent is the most important thing, right? And when I was starting off, that used to be the advice that as long as your intent is right, even if some of your words are not landing, even if some of the comms are not landing, that will work out. What I've seen is that it's not enough. Your actions, your behavior, and the way you communicate, the way you collaborate, that also has to communicate and show who you are as well. So intent is not enough. And that's a thing which I think a lot of people in my age group just don't get, but people who are slightly starting off their career, it resonates well with them. Second thing I think where I feel that it's become, I don't know, is it contrarian or it's become politically incorrect, is that you still need to put in the effort and our number of hours is effort.

(00:58:23):
And I think that's one thing which has become very politically incorrect to say over the years when I was younger, it was the norm that yes, you will have to put in the effort, you will have to put in the hours to grow and improve your skills. And it's not even about your growth in the company, it's just your own growth. You have to spend the time, effort, and energy into growing. I think a lot of that is getting lost in the debates between complete workaholism and just being not very serious about your growth at all. So I think those are the two that I find myself having to explain myself again and again and why I feel this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
I completely agree with that. I find a hugely strong correlation between hours you put into the work you do and success. And I think there's been a return to okay, working hard is really important and you shouldn't be afraid of promoting working really hard. So we've actually gone through everything that I wanted to ask you. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:59:41):
No, I think it has been great talking to. I hope it was useful to people. I've tried to keep it real, but also in takeaway format. And if there are any questions that you have that I feel I have not answered, I'm happy to answer them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:01):
Okay, amazing. Well, we'll have people post in the comments if there's anything else they would love to ask you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:00:19):
The first book is a book which I feel is not quoted enough in product management community, is a book called Small Data by Martin Lindstrom. This is a person who was an advertiser or marketeer who would go and make campaigns for big brands in different countries, and so would have usually very short time to get the pulse of that space and design a campaign around it. And how he got insights very quickly from, and what are some of the takeaways that are there for people working in product space, not just product managers, but designers, researchers, strategy people, anyone really, I can't recommend that book more. And I've cited that book a lot internally.

(01:01:09):
The second book that I recommend is Adam Grant's Originals. I think it's a very important book. It changed a lot of things. When I spoke about that I was going through this crisis of, oh, I'm behind so many things after joining Gojek, Originals was one book that I read which really, really helped me think about my growth and how I see myself. And anyone who is stuck or anyone who feels they are superstars, they are the innovators of the century kind of a thing, it's a book that gives you a very good reality check. And the third book that I recommend is definitely Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. I think especially the thinking slow part becomes very, very important piece as well.

(01:02:11):
And the reason why change is hard, the reason why feedback is hard is because we are used to thinking fast and we are not used to thinking slow. While if you actually think slow, you'll actually welcome change and growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):
Amazing. That book's come up a bunch actually recently on the podcast and it is always sitting under my laptop, holding up my laptop for these interviews. So I fully agree. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:02:41):
I haven't seen a lot of movies recently, I think. But while I was on the flight back from Dubai, I saw Miss Congeniality again and I really, really enjoyed it. I thought it's a very fun movie, but also had a pretty good message. I know it's probably not the movie which anyone would want to cited, but I think it's sometimes good to just watch good entertainment.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):
That's quite the contrarian pick. Yeah, nobody has cited this movie, Miss Congeniality. This is a first, but I love it. It's way out there. I would never would've expected this.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:03:27):
In terms of TV shows, I think the show that I really go back to all the time is Schitt's Creek. I think it's a show which operates at so many different levels without taking itself that seriously, and it just lands. And especially as a product manager and as a leader who obsesses a lot about diversity, I think it did a fantastic job in showing different sides of motherhood, of the LGBTQIA communities, and also teenage girls figuring themselves out as well. I think it did a fantastic job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're hiring product managers especially?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:04:13):
So it's not really one question, but what I like to do with them is to brainstorm choices on an actual product. And I'll typically pick up a product that they use most often and then I will be like, "Okay, what if this product were to do this? Then what do you think, it makes sense? Don't think it makes sense? What about this? Okay, how would it evolve in six months? What would happen in 12 months and so on?" I think it gives you a far better insight into how would it be on working with them on a real case. And you also keep... And what I like about it is that you can keep going back deeper into it and develop it together. So I typically try and pick product that I will also not have very strong opinions on so that it can become a two-way conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):
What do you actually look for in an answer that tells you, "Okay, this candidate is amazing" versus flags that are like, "Hmm, maybe not?"

Vikrama Dhiman (01:05:21):
There are some obvious check marks that are they able to first abstract out and figure out what the overall goals for the product are, who the users for that product are, what would they be focusing on right now, whether this will align with that or not. And then a reason backwards that okay, maybe this may not work, but something on these lines. Are you obsessed about this feature or are you obsessed about okay, what this enables you to do? So if this is what it enables you to do, then are you okay with considering some other options and so on? So I think that's the direction which usually goes in the right way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:04):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:06:08):
So the reason why I've not watched a lot of drama or TV recently is because I've discovered these short video apps through Instagram and all of these apps, they dub Chinese TV serials into English or there will be subtitles in English and they are delivered in TikTok style two-minute videos. And it's a masterstroke in how the series are constructed. The first few episodes, which is like 10 episodes which is about 10 to 15 minutes, sets up the story in such a way that you have to unlock the next 10.

(01:06:47):
And these videos are quite expensive. They end up, one series takes more than the entire cost of monthly cost of Netflix to view. But it's just amazing how the whole product has been put, how all these products have been put together on unlocking the lamification aspects of it, the storytelling aspects of it, the content cutting part of it, and even the selection of the stories part of it. And what I'm told is that once I've learned about it, I've also been reading about it, they're actually companies which are able to give you tools of where you can construct this app yourself. And multiple people, two-people, three-people companies are churning these out and earning a lot of profit from it as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
What is this called for people that want to check this out?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:07:43):
So you can start with DramaBox, you can start with [inaudible 01:07:47] Reels and so on. And there are multiple of these. And those of you who are very familiar with TikTok, you would've seen that some of these show you the first 10 episodes on TikTok and then they take you to their app to view the rest.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
Wow. I love so many unusual contrarian pieces of advice here, I love it. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:08:15):
For me, the most important thing has been that I started my career very late in tech. I was already 25. For the first several years, I worked in a small [inaudible 01:08:32] town in India. I came to Delhi only in 2013, and I joined Gojek in 2018. I think I've done reasonably well for myself. And it's never late to do or what do you want to do and what do you want to be. I think that's the thing that I really, really believe in and I also advise in. Especially as the world is aging and a lot of people are thinking about it, I would say that it's not too late ever. You can be and do what you want right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
So good. It's not too late. I really, really like that advice. My wife is an illustrator designer. She has a book she put out called Am I Overthinking This? It's in my background somewhere there. And she has a chart that communicates that exact message in a really cute way, and we'll try to link to it in the show notes. Final question. You live in Singapore, I know you travel a lot. But if someone were to come to Singapore, is there a food that you think they need to try that's unique to Singapore?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:09:45):
Singapore? There are multiple. So Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures. There are four official languages. And the only thing I will advise is depending on your taste buds, whatever you want to do, you should go and visit a Hawker Center. And it's an amazing experience in itself. And those of you who've seen Crazy Rich Asians, the first thing they do when they land in Singapore is go to the Hawker Center. So it's an experience of its kind. And if you are looking for a specific recommendation, go to Lau Pa Sat. If you are a fan of Indian, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Malay cuisine, you'll get that. If you're a fan of Singaporean Chinese, you'll get that. So you pick what works for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that. Vikrama, I feel like we've produced both a lot of output and we're going to have really great outcomes from our conversation. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow-up on any of the stuff we talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Vikrama Dhiman (01:10:53):
Thank you, Lenny. It's been great talking to you as well. Hopefully, this turns out well. You can reach out to me either on LinkedIn, Vikrama Dhiman, or you can reach out on Twitter. Twitter works better. And the listeners can be useful to me by, well, just sharing whatever they feel. And I continuously follow a lot of people, a lot of people who are not yet famous. Just tell me what your story is, just tell me what you are working on. And as long as you are passionate about it, I will try and find time. Maybe I cannot talk to everyone, but I'll definitely try and find to chat with you and listen out and support or connect you to someone who can help support you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
That's a very generous offer, I think a lot of people are going to take you up on that. Vikrama, thank you so much for being here.

Vikrama Dhiman (01:11:51):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:53):
